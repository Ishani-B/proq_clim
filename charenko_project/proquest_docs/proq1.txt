Full text: Â  THERE'S a sure-fire way to find out what human activity is doing to our planet: We can wait and see what happens. But if we let the system perform the experiment - to use climatologist Stephen H. Schneider's metaphor - it may be too late to repair the environmental damage. ''We have become part of the Earth system and one of the forces for global change,'' according to NASA's Earth System Sciences Committee (ESSC). ''These changes seem irreversible,'' warns Francis P. Bretherton, ESSC chairman and Dr. Schneider's colleague at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). He adds: ''Unless they are perceived and understood in a timely manner, all are likely to be stressful. We must start now to lay the foundation of knowledge and understanding for our successors to act upon.''
In short, humanity must prepare to actively manage the planet. To do this, we need a way to foresee what effect human activity has on Earth's environment and to anticipate how changes in that activity would forestall dangerous results. Computer simulation - such as the climate modeling work of Schneider and his colleagues at NCAR - is the only way this can be done. The trick, Schneider says, is to use this computer guidance effectively in spite of its uncertainty. HE explains: ''(There are) people in the policy business who are demanding that we give them answers. And they don't want the answers after the system performs the experiment. Of course, the truth is we can't give them answers before (then). We can give them scenarios. And we can define the probabilities of those scenarios.'' He adds: ''I think the biggest problem in policy is people expect us to say 'yes' or 'no,' what's going to happen. ... One of the reasons we have policy difficulties ... is that people have the (wrong) idea that we're going to ultimately have exactly the answer. And I think that we're not. What we're going to do is find the ranges of possibilities and consequences.'' Schneider illustrates this with the problem of carbon dioxide (CO2) and climate. This heat-trapping gas slowly accumulates in the atmosphere as we burn fossil fuels. It slows the escape of heat to space, slightly raising Earth's average surface temperature. This is the so-called greenhouse effect. As Schneider points out, there's nothing controversial about the greenhouse effect. It's one of the best established theories in planetary science. 'WHAT is controversial,'' he says, ''is whether the small (temperature) increment is going to make a large enough difference to be of social and environmental importance.'' This uncertainty - plus the fact that any significant effect is unlikely to come until well into the next century - leaves policymakers wondering what, if anything, they should do about CO2 emissions. Schneider notes that computer-generated scenarios give no clear pictures of what might happen to regional water supplies as CO2 accumulates. ''Current betting is slight reductions in the US. But I have to warn that the current betting has only a 51 percent chance of being right, in my opinion. Two out of three models agreeing does not constitute proof, by any stretch, on hydrology. ... (But) models agreeing on temperature does (constitute proof) because, in fact, it's not two out of three but it's 22 out of 23.'' What the computer studies can do, Schneider explains, is show there's a reasonable chance of substantial climatic change. Then, he adds, ''(we) can re-ask the question and ask what are the vulnerabilities of the system. ... What biological systems are vulnerable to changes of what kind? And then ask the physical scientists if there's any probability to those changes.'' Given the uncertainties about CO2's climatic impact, Schneider says it's too soon to try to work out a world policy to curb use of fossil fuels. Among other things, use of these fuels is embedded in the global economy. Asking third-world countries, in particular, to drastically restrict the burning of coal and oil is to limit their economic development. However, he adds, the simulations do suggest that some action be taken - action that is in the nature of insurance and that would be worth taking anyway. FOR example, some computer-generated scenarios suggest there'll be longer growing seasons in high latitudes. Some agriculture could move up there if, say, American wheat lands dry out. So, Schneider notes, it would make sense to start developing the seeds for crops that can handle the variable weather of those latitudes. In general, he says, there's a case to be made for more fuel conservation, especially in developed countries, to slow down CO2 accumulation. ''There's nothing new in that,'' he observes, '' ... you'd have less air pollution, less acid rain, less dependence on foreign supply.'' Also, he adds, ''You develop alternative crop strategies. You develop and test them and find out which ones can work better in wet or dry (conditions) and so forth. And my gosh, that's actually useful in dealing with regular climate variability.'' Schneider believes that, in the long run, climate change implies redestributing resources. With advance warning and a range of alternatives from which to choose, this need not be disastrous. In fact, it might turn out to be a good thing if, for example, the fertilizing influence of increased CO2 concentration in the air led to a more vigorous agriculture. But, Schneider warns, ''if it happens out of ignorance and ... you have to abandon present practices without knowing what to go to, then you probably hurt in the transition.'' What this comes down to is a series of small investments to make it easier to adapt to possible climatechanges. Where computer modeling comes in, Schneider explains, ''is evaluating the probabilities and consequences of future scenarios and the efficacy of various policy choices - whether they'll, in fact, achieve certain stated goals.'' While such modeling is admittedly a ''dirty crystal ball,'' he says it raises a significant question: ''How long do we clean the glass before acting on the things we see inside? It's a great cliche. But it's true.'' Computer models: peering into a climatologist's crystal ball FOR climatologist Warren Washington, computer modeling is the next best thing to time travel for studying Earth's past and future climates. Dr. Washington explains that, as used in his work at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and elsewhere, such computational clairvoyance ''allows you to try to make quantitative estimations of what factors affect the climate - whether or not those are naturally caused or caused by man.'' In fact, he adds, ''to put it into a comprehensive global picture, where all the interactions are taking place simultaneously - the only real tool that you've got is the computer models of the atmosphere and the oceans and so forth.'' Tangle of processes What, then, is this marvelous tool? It isn't any particular computer system, although the capability of the hardware limits what modeling can do. The key to understanding it lies in Dr. Washington's words ''quantitative,'' ''comprehensive,'' and ''interactions.'' For Washington and other climate modelers, these words characterize the difference between confronting an incomprehensible jumble of data that feed an impenetrable tangle of processes, and the ability to construct meaningful scenarios of what the climate probably was like in the distant past and what it may become in the future. Underlying physical laws Climate models are computer programs that simulate the action of the atmosphere, the oceans, or the great ice fields - the major parts of the climate system. These models embody the underlying physical laws, which are well understood. They use these laws to simulate winds and weather, ocean currents, heating and cooling, rainfall and cloudiness - processes that are sometimes not well understood at all. The effect of clouds and aerosols, volcanic particles and other kinds of dust, are especially hard to simulate. Combining simulations Atmospheric programs, which are closely related to weather-forecasting programs, are the most advanced. But ocean and ice-field simulations are now good enough for modelers to begin to put all three of these major climatic players together and study the climate system as a whole. Looking at the state of this work today, Washington notes two aspects: ''One is you have to deal with unexpected events. ''For example, I'm not sure we'll have down to a science the prediction of the number of volcanoes. ... That is going to be a kind of unpredictable (factor). ... ''Then there's going to be a class of (climatic) forcings which we will probably be able to make some pretty good estimates on. ''For example, the increases of carbon dioxide, trace gases, and so forth. We'll probably be able to make some reasonable estimates what the growth of those things are. ''And also, for example, the growth of deforestation. If we know those things - and those are fairly predictable - we can put those into a model ... and make a scenario.'' He warns that ''there's always going to be a certain amount of uncertainty in how you tell the planners and the economists what the climate of the future is.'' Future improvements The resolution of the models contributes to this uncertainty. Right now, they are too coarse-grained to make meaningful climate forecasts on a scale smaller than about half a continent. This resolution should sharpen as faster computers with more memory become available to scientists over the next 10 to 20 years. In sum, Washington says, climate modeling offers ''an opportunity to look into the future in a more quantitative way than we have had in the past in terms of ... the Earth's environment.'' But, he says, ''it's not going to be a clear crystal ball.'' Last of three articles.

Full text: Â  * Think of launching a boat from the steps of the Capitol in Washington D.C. and rowing across to the south lawn of the White House.

These are a few of the possible consequences of the buildup of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere. They sound like the stuff of science fiction, but they are being seriously contemplated by a number of scientists who study Earth's climate.
Carbon dioxide, a trace gas, is being produced in unprecedented quantities by burning fossil fuels -- natural gas, oil, coal -- and wood. Climatologists know the amount of carbon dioxide is increasing steadily, and they think it could have drastic effects on Earth's climate. But they admit that the exact nature of these effects is hidden by scientific uncertainties, leading the US Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) to characterize this as "the ultimate environmental dilemma."
"The world economy is well on its way to performing a great planetary experiment. Before the first results are known, our children and future generations may well have been irrevocably committed to an altered world -- one that could be better in some respects but that also involves unprecedented risks," the CEQ report "Global Energy Futures and the Carbon Dioxide Problem" warned last January.
Scientists know that carbon dioxide (CO$(2$)), although only .03 percent of Earth's atmosphere, has grown steadily over recent years. It now is 17 percent higher than its pre-Industrial Revolution level and is expected to double by the year 2050.
"Ironically, $(carbon dioxide's$) effect on the heat balance of the atmosphere is far greater than this deceptively minute percentage would lead one to believe. The problem with carbon dioxide is that it tends to trap some of the Earth's heat that would normally escape into space, giving the phenomenon the name 'greenhouse effect,'" explains Stephen Schneider of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).
The large computer simulations of the Earth's climate, called general circulation models, agree that a doubling of CO$(2$) will increase the world's average surface temperature by somewhere between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees C. This may not seem much. However, climatologists put the difference between an ice age and an "integlacial" period like the present at about 4 degrees.
Also, carbon dioxide is not the only "greenhouse gas" that man is pouring into the atmosphere. The chloroflourocarbons that once filled spray cans and still are used as refrigerants, methane from natural gas, nitrous oxide from fertilizer, and the pollutants carbon monoxide and ozone trap the sun's heat in a similar fashion. In the Aspen Institute study, "Climate Change and Society," William W. Kellogg and Robert Schware estimate that this could add another 50 percent to the CO$(2$) warming.
Although there is a broad consensus that a warming is probable, there are some scientists who disagree. Last year in the pages of Science magazine, Sherwood Idso of the US Water Conservation Laboratory challenged the climate model results. He argued that the amount of solar energy in the infrared wavelengths that CO$(2$) absorbs is only enough to raise the average temperature by 0.26 degrees C. Several Soviet climatologists also have objected that the Americans have overstated the CO$(2$) temperature effect, but believe that the 2 to 4 degree warming could be produced by a combination of CO$(2$) and the other greenhouse gases.
The warming predicted by the circulation models should have been detectable by now. But attempts by Roland Madden and V. Ramanathan of NCAR to pull these trends out of long-term temperature records thus far have been unsuccessful. This means that either the models have overestimated the warming or the effect is being masked by other climatic changes.
Wallace Broecker of Lamont-Doherty Geological Laboratory believes it is the latter. His conviction is based on an analysis of Greenland ice cores done by Danish scientists. They have found evidence over the last thousand years for two climatic cycles of warming and cooling: an 80-year and an 180-year rhythm. These explain the warming experienced in the early part of this century and the subsequent cooling. If not coincidental, these cycles suggest that the climate is in the midst of a natural cooling trend that has masked the greenhouse warning. Sometime in the 1980s, however, the natural trend should reverse, which could mean a 40-year period of rapidly rising temperatures.
The uncertainty of what such a warming would mean to the climate in detail, and humanity's activities in particular, is far greater than that surrounding the likelihood of the warming itself.
Generally, the climate models show two to three times the average warming at the North Pole. Antarctica also would experience higher than average temperatures but not as great as those in the north. In the tropics, however, there would be little temperature change, while the middle latitudes would experience a 2 to 3 degree increase in average temperature. They also show an increase in relative humidity and precipitation, but these would not be evenly distributed.
"Left to its own devices, the Earth would probably slide into another ice age in perhaps 10,000 years, continuing the global pattern of cooling and warming trends. Another ice age may be averted not by design, but unintentionally through our daily pursuits," Dr. Schneider has observed. This may lead to the conclusion that the greenhouse effect, by creating a "super-interglacial," is a salvation of sorts. Indeed, many climatologists feel that the long-term effect may be to create a climate more hospitable to humans. But the transition could be extremely rough.
An example of the potential problems and one of the most dramatic possible side effects of such a warming would be the melting of some or all of the polar ice cap. The most unstable portion of the world's ice mass is in west Antarctica. One glaciological extremist, J. H. Mercer of Ohio State University, believes this ice sheet could break into a tremendous flotilla of icebergs within 50 years, given such a temperature rise. Others measure the time for such a disintegration in centuries. Measurements of prehistoric sea levels suggest this did happen 120,000 years ago. Should it recur, the result would be a 5 to 6 meter (15 to 20 foot) rise in the world sea level.
Dr. Schneider and Robert S. Chen of NCAR tried to estimate the flooding which would result in the US if the West Antarctic ice sheet disappeared. Among other things, they discovered that 25 to 33 percent of Florida and Louisiana would disappear under the waves. New York, Atlantic City, and Boston would suffer a similar fate. Large portions of the Texas coast would be permanently inundated, as would substantial areas of Virginia, Delaware, and Washington D.C. Except for the Sacramento Valley in California, the West Coast would be relatively unaffected. In round numbers, between 11 and 16 million people would be forced to evacuate their homes and between $110 and $150 billion in real property would be destroyed.
Should the Greenland glaciers also melt, another 5 to 6 meter rise in the world's oceans would result. If the entire polar ice pack melted -- a process glaciologists think would take millenia -- the net effect would be a 200 meter rise in sea level. This would drastically alter the face of the globe, wiping out entire countries. In Japan, water would cover all its major cities. Most of Scandinavia and the lowland countries in Europe would disappear.
Short of such a global cataclysm, however, are a number of more subtle but potentially devastating climatic side effects. The predicted decrease in temperature difference between the tropics and poles would drastically change the planet's weather patterns. Exactly how, remains an open question. But researchers have come up with some tantalizing possibilities.
Dr. Kellogg of NCAR has tried to reconstruct the Earth's climate during a period from 4,500 to 8,000 years ago. During this time, known as the Altithermal, the climate appears to have been 2 to 4 degrees C. warmer than today, though not because of increased carbon dioxide levels. Then, much of northern and eastern Africa were wetter than now. People lived and probably grazed their cattle in many parts of what is now the Sahara Desert. The present "corn belt" in the US was generally a dry prairie. The productivity of subarctic regions like the northern Soviet Union, Canada, and the Scandinavian countries might have been improved.
Attempts of two other researchers to look at the weather in recent warm periods have found similar patterns. The principle difference in these studies is that Europe and the Soviet Union appear drier while Canada and India are wetter than Kellogg suggests.
"In the 1970s adverse weather in a few regions affected food prices, balance of trade, and human settlements worldwide. Developed and developing countries alike find themselves increasingly vulnerable to "abnormal weather." Furthermore, there is a growing realization that carbon dioxide-induced climatic change could have much larger impacts than any of these short-term events," points out the "Climate Change and Society" study.
climate Cassandras worry about studies that find that a 1 degree increase in temperature leads to a 2 percent reduction in the US corn crop; that a longer growing season may allow pests an additional one-to-three generations, making their control even more difficult than at present; and that radical changes in climate may trigger mass human migrations like those that recently took place in the Sahelian region of Africa, in the Midwest US in the 1930s, and a hundred years before in Ireland.
Yet mixed among these apprehensions are some potential benefits. For example, Sylvan Wittwer, director of the Michigan State University Agricultural Experiment Station, has argued that increasing carbon dioxide would be a good thing for many crops. Based on greenhouse experiments, a doubling of CO$(2$) would be beneficial to cereals, grains, legumes, potatoes, cotton, and woody plants. Yield could increase three to seven times due to higher rates of photosynthesis. A number of species may have reduced water requirements.
Whether this potential agricultural advantage would be more than offset by greater variability in weather patterns (which many climatologists expect), by a poleward shift of agricultural belts to generally poorer soils, by more pests, and by other factors is unclear, to say the least. The same holds true for other suggested effects. To verify the greenhouse theory, let alone determine the balance of risk and benefit of its potential impacts, will require substantially more detailed understanding of climate dynamics, knowledge which it may be impossible to develop in time.
"Certain proof of the greenhouse theory will not come for roughly another generation," Dr. Schneider believes. "Since it takes at least that amount of time to significantly alter energy or agricultural technologies, society must take steps toward thoughtful decision-making now -- or risk the consequences without hedging strategies," he argues.
Unfortunately, technological fixes for this problem sound as science-fiction-like as the possible consequences. Those proposed include:
* Removing CO$(2$) from the exhaust stacks of factories and power plants, liquifying or freezing it, and disposing it in the deep ocean.
* Building some 5,700 thousand-megawatt nuclear power plants and using the electricity they produce to remove CO$(2$) from the air and convert it into hydrocarbon fuels.
* Increasing the Earth's plant life by 1 percent per year, and perhaps then converting it into liquid fuels. Alternately, this could be achieved by spreading large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus on the ocean to grow algae.
On the other hand, there are a number of practical steps that can be taken to slow the rate of increase of CO$(2$) and to reduce society's vulnerability to the climatic changes that may be coming.
As a recent panel of the National Academy of Sciences put it: "We must recognize now that increases in energy consumption will have increasingly undesireable climatic side effects."
Increased emphasis on energy conservation, renewable resources, and nuclear power would slow CO$(2$) growth. Although many people are concerned about the possibility of a catastrophic accident at a nuclear reactor, a joint Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Oak Ridge National Laboratory study group points out that the probability of catastrophic climatic change seems far greater than the risk of reactor accidents of similar consequence.
This group estimates that, just to keep CO$(2$) levels to double their pre-Industrial Revolution level, nonfossil-fuel energy sources must grow by 6 to 9 percent per year worldwide. They also make the point that the longer the process of replacing fossil fuels is delayed, the more difficult and expensive it will become.
At the same time, employing better soil conservation measures, improving water management, applying the most advanced agricultural technology, improving our coastal land-use policies by incorporating the likelihood of rising sea levels into the planning process, building and maintaining global food reserves, and providing increased disaster relief measures are suggestions that have been advanced to make human society less vulnerable to climate change.
"Many of the long-term strategies designed to deal with a climate warning would also make agriculture and other social systems more nearly 'climate proof' now. They can guard against the adverse effect of the normal short-term climate fluctuations, giving added insurance in the event of a long-term climate change," points out Walter Orr Roberts, director of the program of food, climate, and the future at Aspen Institute.

Abstract: UNWELCOME as it is, the prevailing view of energy and climate experts who fear a catastrophic warming of the globe is that Americans must make drastic sacrifices in their comfortable way of life. Already, Angelenos are on the cutting edge of this brave new world without leaf blowers and drive-through burger stands, facing new controls on everyday life just to clean up the breathing air, never mind the stratosphere.

Abstract: NEW archeological findings show that humans first occupied Cyprus as long ago as 8200 B.C., about 1,000 years earlier than had been thought. The discovery, scientists said, raises the possibility that human hunting, not climate change, brought about the extinction of the pygmy hippopotamus on the Mediterranean island.

Abstract: AS scientists and public officials urge painful, expensive measures to prevent climate change -- reducing energy use, developing alternative sources of power, curbing production of destructive pollutants -- a breed of visionaries is dreaming of more direct, if seemingly fantastic, countermeasures. These experts are exploring extraordinary ways to combat pollution in the earth's atmosphere and its threat of climatic upheaval.

The Greenhouse Effect? Real Enough.

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/greenhouse-effect-real-enough/docview/110524264/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: A fierce drought is shriveling crops from Texas to North Dakota and has shrunk the Mississippi to its lowest levels on record. Dry years are part of nature's cycle. Still, it's time to take seriously another possible influence -- the warming of the atmosphere by waste gases from a century of industrial activity. Whether or not the feared greenhouse effect is real, there are several preventive measures worth taking in their own right.

More than two dozen pieces of legislation dealing with aspects of global environmental change are currently before Congress, and world leaders like British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher are "turning green." Thatcher recently ordered a six-hour seminar on the global environment for top advisers.
During a briefing for reporters last week at the National Center for Atmospheric Research here, scientists said society should start planning its response now to the effects of regional climate changes brought on by global warming.
But they expressed concern that the political process may speed ahead before adequate research is done to better understand how the atmosphere works, how increased pollution changes it, and what society should do to respond to the changes.
One scientist, John A. Eddy, said these rapid political developments "put science in the uncertain position of a potential savior that might also be stricke n from the cast of the play, should public and policy attention focus, as well it may, on a rush to legislative solutions." Eddy directs the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which runs the national center.
The greenhouse effect refers to the theory that carbon dioxide and other gases, many of them produced by man, trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to gradual warming of the earth. This, in turn, would cause dramatic shifts in climate, such as hotter, drier summers in the central United States and flooding in major coastal cities like New York and Miami.
Last year's drought is widely credited with catapulting climate change to a spot high on the public policy agenda.
Researchers disagree about how much the planet will heat up and what the warming will mean for specific regions. But a scientific consensus has developed that greenhouse warming is real. Data showing increases in average global temperature and levels of carbon dioxide over the past century are convincing, many say.
Scientists also agree that the 1988 drought was not proof of the greenhouse effect, only a normal variation in a North American climate that has its share of extremes. However, such hot, dry summers are likely to increase under the influence of global warming, at least in the central United States.
Some scientists concerned about government policy-making worry that the public and politicians alike widely misunderstand the relationship between the drought and the greenhouse effect, and that the confusion may come back to haunt researchers.
"When we get a cold, wet one, we're going to be told we lied," said Stephen Schneider, head of the the national center's interdisciplinary climate systems section.
Some scientists fear public interest will fade in two or three years anyway, long before adequate understanding and response measures are achieved.
"I'm a little concerned about whether we've caught it a little too soon and too hard," Eddy said. "I don't think we have a real long time to be in the limelight on this, and we have to make the best of it while it exists."
But others say public interest in global climate change is here to stay. It now is "a central issue, dealt with at the policy level, so it's going to continue to be big news," said Rafe Pomerance, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute, a Washington, D.C., policy and research center.
"No government agency is yet responsible for greenhouse policy, but we're getting there soon," Pomerance said in a telephone interview. "The only way it could slow is if the scientific consensus breaks down, and that has been building for ten years."
Meanwhile, the limelight is shining brightly. Rarely does a week go by without some news - political or scientific - related to global climate change. A few examples from May alone include:
May 8: The White House admitted changing the planned congressional testimony of a key scientist to make it sound as if the greenhouse effect was less severe than the scientist believed. The researcher, James T. Hansen of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, triggered much interest last summer with testimony that greenhouse warming was almost certainly occurring.
May 11: In a major policy reversal, the Bush administration announced it would support efforts to curb global warming and called for a U.S.-sponsored international workshop on the subject.
May 11: Scientists at an American Geophysical Union meeting reported that some kinds of clouds enhance the greenhouse effect and others reduce it. Even a small change in cloud cover around the world could have a major impact on climate, they said.
May 18: At a meeting of utility officials in Seattle, researchers reported the nation's air-conditioning needs could increase so much over the next two decades due to climate change that 86 more mid-size electrical power-generating plants would be needed.
And in the May 19 issue of Science magazine, scientists reported that the world's oceans are steadily rising, an effect they said could be the result of greenhouse warming.
Americans can expect a steady flow of news about global climate change in upcoming months as more scientific reports are issued, Congressional hearings held and international panels meet. The federal government this summer will release several studies detailing policy options for dealing with climate change, Pomerance said.
And come drought or flood in the United States this summer, the political wrangling over what to do about climate change is likely to continue as greenhouse "hawks" and "doves" jockey for position.
Hawks, who represent a growing majority opinion, are convinced greenhouse warming is already under way. Doves believe it's just another "doomsday scenario," or at least feel society is resilient enough to respond to any such crisis, said Michael H. Glantz, a political scientist who heads the environmental and societal impacts group at the national center.
The publ ic needs to be aware of the political games played in the name of climate change, Glantz said.
The attempt to change Hansen's testimony was a low blow, but Congress is just as guilty of trying to manipulate the climate change issue, he said.
Congressional hearings on the subject "are held primarily for political purposes," he asserted. For example, Glantz said, Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., whose subcommittee on science, technology and space Hansen testified before earlier this month, selects experts whose perspectives match the views Gore wants expressed.
"True, there is muzzling in the executive, but there's muzzling in the legislature, too," Glantz said. "No one asks, 'Who is the legislature muzzling?' "
Gore is well-informed on the subject of climate change, "but keep in mind he also has a political agenda."
Gore, through a spokeswoman, told the Post-Dispatch: "We had a balanced hearing with the purpose of developing a clearer understanding of the greenhouse effect and how we should respond to it. What the White House did was wrong and I was surprised that they tried it."
Researchers hope the government will realize the need to increase funds for desperately needed study.
Especially needed is research to bolster computer models that help scientists look into the future and see what an increase in carbon dioxide will mean for society. For example, they want to determine how much of the corn belt will turn too hot and dry to grow corn and how soon U.S. coastlines may be submerged by rising oceans.
But to delve to these depths with the computer models, more computer power is needed, as are extensive studies of clouds and other key components of the atmosphere.
"There is no better insurance policy you can buy than to understand the earth," Eddy said. "We're not talking about sending a mission to Mars and possibly finding out that it's nothing more than a bunch of red rock. We're talking about something that no matter how the answers come out, it's tremendously important information that intelligent policy-makers should have."
Critics, such as many in the Bush administration, argue that costly responses should await more scientific certainty about the greenhouse effect and its social and economic consequences.
But many scientists familiar with public policy-making argue such certainty is not necessary.
"Should we wait until we're 99 percent certain?" Schneider asked. "We don't require that for weapons systems today."
In such cases only minimal certainty that the weapons are effective is required because they are "strategic hedges."
Rapid changes in the environment are security threats, he said.
The scientists emphasized that whether or not greenhouse warming occurs, several steps taken to lessen its impact would also have an important impact on other environmental, health and economic problems. These include acid rain, the health effects of air pollution, dependence on foreign oil and energy inefficiency in the manufacturing sector.
In the final analysis, Americans must "change their state of consciousness" about conservation, Eddy said. For example, they must become willing to take their used nickel-cadmium batteries to specialized depositories and stop using cars without thinking about whether they really need to.
"We will have to get rid of the notion that 'because I can afford it, I can do it,' " Eddy said.
The thought of such changes has made some of the greenhouse doves question whether scientists aren't just a bit too confident about basing major policy shifts on the greenhouse warming idea, because it's "only a theory," Schneider said.
"Gravity is only a theory," he noted. "So do you stick your neck in a guillotine" to test the theory?

Full text: Â  Imagine 200 gigantic marine farms that drift on the surfaces of the world's oceans. Or satellites bigger than Boston or San Francisco that beam solar energy back to Earth. Or so many tons of chemicals dumped into the atmosphere to cleanse it that the sky is bleached white.
These are just a few of the visionary schemes being dreamed up by some of the nation's most brilliant scientists as possible ways to combat the global warming that is expected to occur as a result of the greenhouse effect.
While other researchers debate whether the planet has begun to heat up, these scientists are hard at work concocting planetary engineering projects costing hundreds of billions of dollars that they say could stabilize the Earth's climate if the greenhouse effect overheats the globe in the 21st century.
Among the proposals are these:
* Launching a fleet of 700 jumbo jets to disperse 35 million tons of sulfur dioxide droplets each year into the upper atmosphere - so many that they would turn the sky white. The droplets would form a massive shield over the planet, similar to a one-way mirror, that would reflect sunlight and help cool off the Earth.
* Building enormous floating beds of kelp - all together, equivalent to five times the size of Texas - that would drift on the ocean's surfaces sucking up carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The marine plants could then be sunk to store the carbon dioxide at the ocean's bottom.
* Dumping 300,000 tons of iron pellets into the oceans. These pellets would fertilize "unproductive" parts of the ocean, providing the nutrients for tiny marine plants, which would absorb carbon dioxide. When the plants died, they would sink to the ocean's bottom. Fish eating the plants would excrete droppings containing carbon dioxide that also would sink to the sea floor.
* Constructing 375 satellites - each containing 50 square miles of solar panels - that would orbit 22,300 miles above the Earth. These satellites, built during the next 75 years, would generate electricity from sunlight and transmit this energy back to Earth on microwave beams. By eliminating the need for new power plants, they would reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide.
While some of the proposals seem fantastic, they are being seriously discussed by scientists in important journals and at prestigious workshops.
A paper discussing the iron-dumping proposal was published in the May 10 issue of Nature, a major British science journal. And a panel of the National Research Council, which advises the federal government, has recommended that at least two of the schemes be actively explored.
But some environmentalists are aghast at the proposals, which would be the largest efforts ever undertaken to manipulate nature. They fear that the ideas - if carried out - might cause irreparable damage to the planet.
Wallace Broecker, a geochemist at Columbia University and a proponent of the plan to dump sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, believes that the time has come to actively discuss such global projects.
"As scientists we should be exploring all of the possible options," he said. "We need to develop insurance policies for the future."
Broecker said many scientists did not want to discuss these proposals
because they believe the public is against climate engineering.
But Rodney M. Fujita, a staff scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit group, said these schemes were dangerously misguided. ''These proposals are bad ideas. They signify an arrogance towards nature. There are many simpler things that could be done to slow down global warming - such as improving energy efficiency, planting forests and developing alternative fuels."
Fujita said that virtually every effort people have taken to manipulate nature has backfired, causing unforeseen environmental consequences. "We don't know what we are doing," he said. "These proposals could have disastrous results."
Most climate-change scientists now believe that the average temperature of the Earth will increase 4 to 9 degrees in the next 100 years, according to a recent survey by the Global Environmental Change Report, an Arlington, Mass., newsletter.
The survey found that 76 percent of the 330 scientists who participated believe that global warming caused by human activities has already begun; 90 percent believe countries should take immediate steps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
The greenhouse effect is the name given to a theory that says temperatures will rise as carbon dioxide, methane and other gases build up in the atmosphere, much as a greenhouse traps solar heat. Among the effects are melting ice caps, rising seas, shifting of agricultural lands and changing weather patterns.
Of the proposals to counteract the greenhouse effect, the iron-dumping plan has received the most acceptance. A National Research Council workshop on the subject was held last Dec. 4 and 5 in Washington.
The workshop's participants recommended that, "after careful modeling and appropriate preliminary experiments," a large international "iron-enrichment experiment" be conducted at a cost of between $50 million and $150 million. They suggested that the first experiments be conducted off the coast of Antarctica or Alaska.
Adam Heller, a chemical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin, said he knew of no harmful ecological impacts that such an experiment could cause. ''It would only be done after very careful study," he said.
But Fujita said that adding iron to the ocean could harm marine life. He said that his organization would lobby vigorously against the proposal. "We are very worried that it could become policy," he said.
The proposal to construct massive "marine farms" of kelp or other algae was also given a tentative go-ahead by a panel convened by the National Research Council last December. That panel recommended that a "framework" be developed within the next nine to 12 months to examine the project's potential.
Howard Wilcox, a San Diego scientist who served on that panel, said floating kelp farms of 100 square miles or more could be constructed on 30 percent of the world's oceans.
Wheeler J. North, an environmental scientist at the California Institute of Technology and another panel member, said that these marine farms could cause fog to form and have harmful impacts on fish.
But he said small experiments should be undertaken to see whether such marine farms are feasible. "I'm not advocating that we jump in with a $60 million to $100 million experiment," he said. "But I believe the concept has potential and that it could make a difference in slowing down the greenhouse effect."
The idea of dispersing sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere has been proposed by Broecker of Columbia. He estimates that the procedure would cost about $30 billion a year and that it would have to be repeated annually because the particles would slowly fall out of the sky.
He also acknowledges that there could be some serious side-effects: The particles would bleach the blue sky whitish, create huge amounts of acid rain and might damage the Earth's ozone layer.
But he said those impacts were minor compared with the devastation that could be brought on by the greenhouse effect.
The idea of launching solar-powered satellites that beam electricity to Earth was first proposed by Peter E. Glaser in 1968. The federal government evaluated the proposal and in 1981 the National Research Council recommended against further funding because of "serious difficulties" in the concept.
But today, 22 years later, it is again being discussed.
Glaser, now a vice president at Arthur D. Little Inc., an international consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., estimated that it would cost $100 billion to develop the concept and about $12 billion for each solar-powered satellite that is built.
"The idea has definitely been resurrected," Glaser said. "There was a conference on it in mid-May in Paris. It is being looked at in Europe, Japan and the Soviet Union."
Other schemes have been suggested to remove chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), a greenhouse gas that is also eroding the ozone layer, from the atmosphere.
Thomas Stix, a Princeton University physicist, has suggested that giant lasers could be built atop mountains to scrub CFCs from the atmosphere. The lasers would break apart the CFCs before they had a chance to drift into the upper atmosphere, where they could damage the ozone layer.
Stix estimates that infrared lasers could blast apart one million tons of CFCs a year, equal to the annual flow into the atmosphere. CFCs are expected to account for about 25 percent of the warming expected by the middle of the 21st century.
North, of Caltech, said that the time had come to seriously study countermeasures such as giant lasers, solar satellites and marine farms. He said that increased energy efficiency and reforestation would not be enough to halt global warming.
"I think it's important that we start some modest experiments today so that if the worst projections of global warming come to pass we will be prepared," he said.

Full text: Â  The risk of global warming is serious enough to warrant a prompt national push for energy conservation, the National Academy of Sciences warned yesterday.
The academy said that in the next 30 years the United States could reduce by as much as 40 percent the emissions of industrial gases blamed for trapping solar heat and raising the Earth's temperature.
It recommended steps ranging from the mundane - encouraging the use of energy-efficient light bulbs, appliances and heaters - to the novel - painting half of the country's roofs white, or covering them with plants.
The academy blueprint also recommended tax incentives or regulation to increase auto fuel efficiency 30 percent; development of safer nuclear plants, and charging consumers more for types of energy whose generation produces excess pollution.
The panel considered these types of measures to be an insurance policy against more drastic steps that would have to be taken if the more dire predictions of man-made climate change are borne out in the future.
Even if measures are taken to reduce energy consumption, the academy panel suggested preparing for possible weather changes resulting from warmer temperatures. It proposed planning buildings, dams and bridges to withstand more frequent and powerful storms, and research to ensure that the nation's farmers would still be able to grow food.
The recommendations are more far-reaching than the Bush administration has ventured, and are expected to provide ammunition for congressional critics of the administration's cautious approach to global warming.
While most of the world's industrial nations have set firm goals for cutting their production of carbon dioxide, the most important of the atmospheric gases that trap the sun's radiation, the Bush administration has refused to adopt similar targets and has insisted upon exhaustive consideration of the economic impact of reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
"Despite the great uncertainties, greenhouse warming is a potential threat sufficient to justify action now," concluded a panel of the academy's Committee on Science, Engineering and Public Policy.
Congress had asked for the assessment from the federal government's top advisory body on scientific and technical matters. The academy named a 46- member panel consisting of scientists, economists and public-policy analysts.
The buildup in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases, primarily from burning fossil fuels, is believed to be acting like the glass in a greenhouse, trapping more and more of the sun's heat.
In its report, the panel agreed with the administration that none of the major computer-generated climate models provides a "reliable forecast" of global warming. But the panel pointed to a "reasonable chance" that by the middle of the next century, when greenhouse gases are expected to double in concentration over pre-industrial times, global temperatures will increase by 2 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit.
A 9-degree increase would be a "warming greater than any in human history," the scientists said. Such an increase could cause the oceans to rise, creating coastal flooding, and lead to droughts in some areas of the world.
That estimate is within the range of the general scientific consensus that temperatures will increase 4 to 8 degrees.
Environmentalists welcomed the study because it put the prestigious academy on record supporting the kind of energy conservation proposals that have been opposed by the Bush administration.
"It's irresponsible not to buy the kind of insurance the academy is recommending," said Dan Lashof, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, called the academy study constructive and responsible. He said the administration "will seriously review and consider it."
If conservation efforts fail to curb the greenhouse warming, the academy recommended studying a "Star Wars"-style effort that would use exotic devices to deflect sunlight away from the planet.
One option would launch 50,000 space mirrors, each 62 square miles, into orbit to deflect sunlight. Another would float billions of aluminum-coated, hydrogen-filled balloons in the stratosphere to reflect sunlight and its heat. A third would use guns or balloons to release and maintain a dust cloud in the stratosphere to filter sunlight and heat.
Sen. Al Gore (D., Tenn.) dismissed the geo-engineering options, saying ''manhandling of the environment created these problems."

WAYS FOR HOMEOWNERS TO REDUCE ENERGY USE
* Replacing regular incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent light bulbs would cut lighting energy consumption in half.
* Insulating water heaters and adding low-flow devices to conserve warm water could reduce consumption 40 to 70 percent.
* Using more efficient refrigerators and dishwashers can lower energy consumption 10 to 30 percent.
* Heating bills can be cut up to 60 percent by increased insulation, weatherstripping and the use of heat pumps.

WE CAN'T WAIT ON GLOBAL WARMING: STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES IS COST-EFFECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS.

Full text: Â  There continues to be much debate over whether we can wait to do something about the prospect of global warming. I urge strongly that we not wait.
What do we know about global warming so far? We know that water vapor, clouds, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons trap a certain kind of heat, called infrared radiation, near the Earth's surface, resulting in the so-called greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect and the atmosphere it produces are what make the planet habitable. It is one reason there is life on this planet and none on, say, Pluto.
But in the last 150 years, human beings have altered the composition of the atmosphere. Human population growth, driving, increased use of fossil fuels and rampant deforestation have resulted in a 25 percent increase in carbon dioxide and a 100 percent increase in methane.
These increases have trapped about two extra watts of radiative energy over every square meter of the Earth. That's the wattage equivalent of about 500 trillion Christmas tree bulbs spread throughout the planet.
With all that is known then, why is there any debate over the likelihood, seriousness and response to the anticipated global warming?
First of all, it is difficult to translate this unnatural heating into degrees of temperature rise. It requires calculations that are based on not- yet-verified assumptions about clouds, soils, forests, ice and oceans. These factors could change in ways that feed back on the heating, either reducing it, as global-warming critics like to point out, or enhancing it, as most present climate models project.
Such models have concluded that the last 100 years should have experienced warming of about 2 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with the previous 100 years, provided all other factors were constant. But that is a dubious prospect. Several national and international assessment bodies have suggested that if the carbon-dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbon trends continue, additional global warming of 2 to 9 degrees can be expected in the 21st century.
What has happened so far? There has been about 1 degree of global warming observed from 1890 to 1990. It is not clear, however, whether other factors - such as natural climate fluctuations, changes in solar heat output or dust generated from human or volcanic activities - affected the global temperature.
Some critics note that there is not a perfect match between decade-to- decade fluctuations in climate and the buildup of greenhouse gases. True. But they often fail to mention that no knowledgeable scientist ever would expect such agreement. Natural fluctuations in climate occur at different rates from the temperature changes that would be brought about by global warming.
It is illogical to expect a decade-by-decade match in greenhouse pollution and the Earth's temperature. It's like saying we can't determine the odds for a given roll of a pair of dice because we couldn't forecast accurately the specific sequence of faces we'd get in two dozen rolls. All gamblers know better!
Only long-term, global trends can verify or deny that a warming trend due to the buildup of greenhouse gases has been detected with 99 percent statistical confidence - the usual scientific criterion. This level of certainty will take 10 to 20 years more to establish, not a few years, as some opposed to immediate policy responses argue.
Moreover, it is not cost-free to wait for such scientific certainty,
because the planet could then be forced to adapt to a greater amount and rate of climate change than if we acted now to slow down the rate of buildup of greenhouse gases.
Of course, whether any amount of scientific uncertainty justifies waiting for more data rather than hedging now against present trends is not a scientific judgment, but rather a value issue over how to take risks. No one buys insurance with 99 percent certainty that she or he, rather than the insurance company, will be the financial winner - in fact, if we wait to see whether we get sick or hurt, it is then too late to buy insurance, as no one will sell it.
A few vocal critics recommend waiting for three to five years of more study before acting. That sounds prudent, but it would not, as every national and international assessment reaffirms, provide definitive answers on the detailed character of climatic changes or their implications for natural ecosystems, forestry, agriculture, water supplies, human health, sea level and severe storms.
I'm not a planetary gambler.
I'd prefer to slow down the unprecedentedly fast rate of buildup of greenhouse gases rather than gamble that things may work out all right in the end. Furthermore, study after study has shown that the best way to start to reduce the buildup rate of greenhouse gases is to do cost-effective improvements.
These fall in the categories of controlling population growth, increasing the efficiency of energy production and energy use, and virtually eliminating the production of chlorofluorocarbons, the chemicals that also deplete stratospheric ozone.
The glib pronouncement from some administration officials that carbon- dioxide emission controls would bankrupt the nation simply doesn't hold water.
Yale University economist William Nordaus, himself a critic of severe cuts in carbon-dioxide emissions, nevertheless has argued that modest cuts in carbon dioxide - from 10 percent to 47 percent - would yield economic benefits in excess of the costs. And this set of benefits that he calculated did not even include the free extras: less acid rain, less local air pollution to damage health and ecosystems, less balance-of-payments deficit from importing foreign oil and lowered long-term energy costs of manufactured goods.
To me, climate-change "insurance" that also pays other dividends is long overdue. We need to eliminate the billions of dollars of government subsidies to inefficient fossil-fuel uses or deforestation practices in order to move toward lower real costs and an environmentally more stable 21st century.
Fuel prices must reflect total costs, including potential environmental damages. This may upset the most-polluting industries or ideological opponents of fuel taxes, but no market can be "free" unless all costs are included. Political rhetoric about uncertainty as an excuse to delay actions and preserve the status quo only commits the future to greater environmental risks. I hope it doesn't take another set of environmental crises like that of the record-hot summer of 1988 to shock us into action after the fact.

Full text: Â  Imagine 200 gigantic marine farms that drift on the surfaces of the world's oceans. Or satellites bigger than Boston or Montreal that beam solar energy back to Earth. Or so many tonnes of chemicals dumped into the atmosphere to cleanse it that the sky is bleached white.
These are just a few of the visionary schemes being dreamed up by scientists as possible ways to combat the global warming that is expected to occur as a result of the greenhouse effect.
While other researchers debate whether the planet has begun to heat up, these scientists are hard at work concocting planetary engineering projects costing hundreds of billions of dollars that they say could stabilize the Earth's climate if the greenhouse effect overheats the globe in the 21st century.
Among the proposals are these:
Launching a fleet of 700 jumbo jets to disperse 35 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide droplets each year into the upper atmosphere _ so many that they would turn the sky white. The droplets would form a massive shield over the planet, similar to a one-way mirror, that would reflect sunlight and help cool off the Earth.
U- Building enormous floating beds of kelp _ all together, equivalent to five times the size of Texas _ that would drift on the ocean's surfaces sucking up carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The marine plants could then be sunk to store the carbon dioxide at the ocean's bottom.
U- Dumping 300,000 tonnes of iron pellets into the oceans. These pellets would fertilize ''unproductive'' parts of the ocean, providing the nutrients for tiny marine plants, which would absorb carbon dioxide. When the plants died, they would sink to the ocean's bottom. Fish eating the plants would excrete droppings containing carbon dioxide that also would sink to the sea floor.
U- Constructing 375 satellites _ each containing 128 square kilometres of solar panels _ that would orbit 36,000 km above the Earth. These satellites, built during the next 75 years, would generate electricity from sunlight and transmit this energy back to Earth on microwave beams. By eliminating the need for new power plants, they would reduce the buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
While some of the proposals seem fantastic, they are being seriously discussed by scientists in important journals and at prestigious workshops.
A paper discussing the iron-dumping proposal was published in a recent issue of Nature, a major British science journal. And a panel of the U.S. National Research Council, which advises the federal government, has recommended that at least two of the schemes be actively explored.
But some environmentalists are aghast at the proposals, which would be the largest efforts ever undertaken to manipulate nature. They fear that the ideas _ if carried out _ might cause irreparable damage to the planet.
Wallace Broecker, a geochemist at Columbia University and a proponent of the plan to dump sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, believes that the time has come to actively discuss such global projects.
''As scientists we should be exploring all of the possible options,'' he said. ''We need to develop insurance policies for the future.''
But Rodney M. Fujita, a staff scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, a non-profit group, said these schemes are dangerously misguided. ''These proposals are bad ideas. They signify an arrogance towards nature. There are many simpler things that could be done to slow down global warming _ such as improving energy efficiency, planting forests and developing alternative fuels.''
Fujita said that virtually every effort people have taken to manipulate nature has backfired, causing unforeseen environmental consequences.
Most climate-change scientists now believe that the average temperature of the Earth will increase two to five degrees C in the next 100 years, according to a recent survey by the Global Environmental Change Report, an Arlington, Mass., newsletter.
The survey found that 76 per cent of the 330 scientists who participated believe that global warming caused by human activities has already begun; 90 per cent believe countries should take immediate steps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
The greenhouse effect is the name given to a theory that says temperatures will rise as carbon dioxide, methane and other gases build up in the atmosphere, much as a greenhouse traps solar heat. Among the projected effects are melting ice caps, rising seas, shifting of agricultural lands and changing weather patterns.
Of the proposals to counteract the greenhouse effect, the iron-dumping plan has received the most acceptance.
At a workshop on the subject last year organized by the National Research Council, participants recommended that, ''after careful modeling and appropriate preliminary experiments,'' a large international ''iron-enrichment experiment'' be conducted at a cost of up to $150 million US. They suggested that the first experiments be conducted off the coast of Antarctica or Alaska.
Adam Heller, a chemical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin, said he knew of no harmful ecological impacts that such an experiment could cause. ''It would only be done after very careful study,'' he said.
But Fujita said that adding iron to the ocean could harm marine life. He said that his organization would lobby vigorously against the proposal. ''We are very worried that it could become policy,'' he said.
The proposal to construct massive ''marine farms'' of kelp or other algae was also given a tentative go-ahead by a panel convened by the research council.
Howard Wilcox, a San Diego scientist who served on that panel, said floating kelp farms of 250 square km or more could be constructed on 30 per cent of the world's oceans.
But another panel member, Wheeler J. North, an environmental scientist at the California Institute of Technology, said that these marine farms could cause fog to form and have harmful impacts on fish.
The idea of dispersing sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere has been proposed by Columbia University's Broecker. He estimated the procedure would cost about $30 billion a year and that it would have to be repeated annually because the particles would slowly fall out of the sky.
He also acknowledges that there could be some serious side-effects: The particles would bleach the blue sky whitish, create huge amounts of acid rain and might damage the Earth's ozone layer.

VANCOUVER
Headlines warn us of potential recession, change in the value of the dollar, rising interest rates, inflation and every tremor in the stock market.
In response, governments thrash about trying to find a magic formula for steady growth in the economy. Economists are arguably the most influential group of professional people in the world today as their every pronouncement carries vast repercussions. No wonder the planet is in such desperate shape.
Economists live in a dream world that bears no relationship to the things that keep us alive. Consider this.
I have just returned to Canada after sweltering through 10 days of a blistering heat wave in England that reached the highest temperature in English history _ 37C _ on Aug. 3, 1990. This could well eclipse 1989 as England's hottest year on record.
Scanning newspapers in England, I learned of record air pollution in cities, water shortages, increases in forest fires, increases in insurance claims for damage to homes, the collapse of market gardening, drownings and other heat-related deaths, skyrocketing prices of cheese and milk, and a drastic decrease in holiday bookings.
I can attest to the suffocating build-up of low-level ozone in London and chaos in train schedules as tracks buckled under the heat. That short heat wave had tremendous repercussions throughout English society.
Is the weather instability we seem to be seeing around the world merely the normal fluctuations of nature or the consequences of global warming?
Human activity has already significantly increased global temperature as P.D. Jones and T.M.L. Wigley report in the August 1990 edition of Scientific American. So what do economists have to say about it? Here is the response of Yale University professor William Nordhaus in The Economist of July 7, 1990.
He acknowledges that ''scientific monitoring has firmly established the build-up of the main greenhouse gases.'' But as an economist, Nordhaus thinks planetary climate is irrelevant to urban life: ''Cities are increasingly becoming climate-proofed by technological changes like air-conditioning and shopping malls.''
Even though our very lives depend on nutrition from agriculture that is very climate-sensitive, to Nordhaus, food can be written off: ''For the bulk of the economy, however _ manufacturing, mining, utilities, finance, trade and most services _ climate change over the next few decades is likely to have less effect than the economic reunification of Germany this summer.''
His reasoning is like concluding that since the stomach is a minor organ compared to the brain, we can do without it.
But what about the urgent warnings about increasing greenhouse gases? Here's Nordhaus' response: ''All these prognostications are judgments based on immense uncertainties. They could be dead wrong. This uncertainty must affect mankind's choice of responses to the threat of global warming.''
Since Nordhaus, like most economists, places the economy above all else when it comes to matters environmental, he finds the economic costs of meeting the greenhouse effect head on too great.
Nordhaus calculates the bill for a 60-per-cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at over $300 billion annually.
Nordhaus's choice to counter global warming is technology: ''The option of climate engineering has been completely neglected. Possibilities include shooting particulate matter into the stratosphere to cool the earth, altering land-use patterns to change the globe's reflectivity, and cultivating carbon-eating organisms in the oceans.''
He then dismisses the fact that ''such measure would raise profound legal, ethical and environmental issues'' because the technological attempts would also probably be far more cost-effective than shutting down the world's power plants.''
There you have it folks, the world seen through the bizarre lenses of an economist.
Nordhaus even suggests that we can adapt our lifestyles and economy to the unpredictable and chaotic consequences of global warming. My 10 days in England suggest that if the predicted warming does occur, it will be socially and economically disastrous.
We have no choice. We must begin to massively cut down on greenhouse gas emissions now, else we leave our children to pay the disastrous price of trusting economists with their foolhardy ideas.

He acknowledges that "scientific monitoring has firmly established the build-up of the main greenhouse gases." But as an economist, Nordhaus thinks planetary climate is irrelevant to urban life: "Cities are increasingly becoming climate-proofed by technological changes like air-conditioning and shopping malls."
The economic importance of industrialization apparently renders Americans exempt from the physical world: "Greenhouse warming would have little effect on America's national output. About three per cent of American GNP originates in climate-sensitive sectors as farming and forestry. Another 10 per cent comes from sectors only modestly sensitive - energy, water systems, property and construction. Far the largest share - 87 per cent - comes from sectors, including most services, that are negligibly affected by climate change."
Even though our very lives depend on nutrition that comes from agriculture that is very climate-sensitive, to Nordhaus, food can be written off: "For the bulk of the economy, however - manufacturing, mining, utilities, finance, trade and most services - climate change over the next few decades is likely to have less effect than the economic reunification of Germany this summer."

There you have it folks, the world seen through the bizarre lenses of an economist.
We are grossly ignorant about the factors that shape climate and weather while history is full of examples of even the most benign technologies having unpredictable and undesirable consequences when applied on a massive scale. It would be absolutely foolhardy to believe that we can come up with a technological fix for greenhouse warming.
Nordhaus even suggests that we can adapt our lifestyles and economy to the unpredictable and chaotic consequences of global warming. My 10 days in England suggest that if the predicted warming does occur, it will be socially and economically disastrous.
We have no choice. We must begin to massively cut down on greenhouse gas emissions now, else we leave our children to pay the disastrous price of trusting economists with foolhardy ideas.

NDP girds to tackle the Threat: [3* Edition]

Author: Kuehn, Larry

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/ndp-girds-tackle-threat/docview/243539040/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: The NDP has the potential to make B.C. a leader in conversion to a sustainable society rather than a contributor to the global ecology crisis. When the global economic crisis of the 1930s Depression hit Canada, the NDP's forerunner - the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation - was created. The CCF put forward an agenda for change that did much to make Canadian society more humane and just, including the creation of unemployment insurance, pensions, and medicare. The NDP green caucus has been created as a vehicle for members of the NDP to help create that program for change. British Columbians who are concerned about the environment and fed up with the government's lack of substantive action deserve a chance to vote for a party that is willing to tackle the fundamental problems in the environment, not just the symptoms.

Full text: Larry Kuehn is a former president of the B.C. Teachers Federation and one of the organizers of the New Democratic Party's "green" caucus.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL crisis is real, and it is the obligation of political parties to put forward programs to deal with the causes.
That is why some New Democrats have formed a "green" caucus in the party. They want to ensure that the environment is at the top of the agenda for the NDP and that its program goes beyond the symptoms of the crisis.
Mike Harcourt and his NDP Opposition put forward a series of bills aimed at cleaning up environmental problems. They are necessary to fix the results of neglect from 15 years of Social Credit governments that haven't cared enough about the environment.
Each day we read reports that confirm Social Credit's approval of development that pollutes. For example, a Nov. 18 Sun story reported 393 B.C. government-authorized discharges into the ocean in 1988, up from 85 in 1973.
Harcourt's call for a cleanup of B.C.'s water and air is a good start, but it isn't enough. We will keep creating unanticipated environmental hot spots until we recognize and eliminate the source of the problem: unfettered growth, based primarily on the consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels.
It's not news any more that a prime result of our growth patterns in industry and consumer goods is global climate change, already under way and destined to get much worse unless we act now.
But isn't that everyone's problem? Do we have any special responsibility in B.C. for growth-created global warming?
Yes, we have. Per capita we in B.C. are probably a greater source of the problem than anyone else in the world. Canadians are the world's top energy consumers - and with our consumption goes the release of carbon dioxide from burning fuels.
Trees help to counter the carbon dioxide problem by removing it from the atmosphere. We had massive forests in our province, but are cutting them at an unsustainable rate. Too often we have looked at population and industrial growth and the cutting down of trees primarily in terms of our short-term economic interests. If that continues, we will go on creating an ecological deficit that will be very costly to our children.
Our political leaders should be telling us just how serious the problems are. They should be pointing out that we are collectively responsible for the problems and that it will take changes in industry and government, not just individual behavior, to solve them. They should be proposing comprehensive programs to change the situation, including ones to control growth and to preserve significant portions of our forests.
Most of the impetus for responding to the crisis has come from committed individuals and from such organizations as Greenpeace and the Western Canada Wilderness Committee. Their activities have been essential in raising awareness and forcing government and industry to deal with some specific problems.
But that is not enough. We need a massive conversion program - a plan to convert to a sustainable society. It must be a program for which we all carry responsibility, not one that passes the costs on to individual workers. We need political leadership with the will to undertake the conversion.
Much more is needed than just looking at the current crisis from an economic perspective. A sustainable society conversion plan must incorporate changes in culture and education, consumption and social expectations, and capital use and economic planning.
Such changes won't be made by a few people acting alone, or even by groups of committed activists. The attention and resources of society - and the vehicle of government - will have to focus on them.
To successfully convert to sustainability we must regulate the actions of the transnational corporations that control much of our province and whose interest is primarily in profits, not in the ecology and social wellbeing of people.
The NDP has the potential to make B.C. a leader in conversion to a sustainable society rather than a contributor to the global ecology crisis.
When the global economic crisis of the 1930s Depression hit Canada, the NDP's forerunner - the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation - was created. The CCF put forward an agenda for change that did much to make Canadian society more humane and just, including the creation of unemployment insurance, pensions, and medicare.
With the global ecological crisis facing us in the 1990s, the NDP again must set an agenda for radical change - the conversion to a sustainable and just society.
The NDP green caucus has been created as a vehicle for members of the NDP to help create that program for change. British Columbians who are concerned about the environment and fed up with the government's lack of substantive action deserve a chance to vote for a party that is willing to tackle the fundamental problems in the environment, not just the symptoms.

Abstract: The problem is that coal produces more carbon dioxide when burned than most other fossil fuels. Not that oil and gas are clean. Burning of the three fossil fuels is overloading the atmosphere with carbon dioxide, believed to be the chief e of global warming. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has told the world that global carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced. And Mulroney is under considerable pressure to set an example by cutting carbon emissions at home. Worldwide, man pumps an estimated 4.5 to 5.5 billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere each year in the form of carbon dioxide, largely through the burning of oil, gas, coal, and wood in the western world. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen by 25 per cent since the middle of the 19th century.

Full text: A Southam Environment Project; one sidebar
Six coal trains a day roll through the Rocky Mountains, down the Fraser River and dump their loads at the largest coal terminal in North America.
Just south of Vancouver, the Roberts Bank superport is the gateway to vast overseas markets for the Canadian coal industry, which is gearing up for the fight of its life.
As federal Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard said earlier this year: "Coal burning is a terrible pollutant. Not the future for this country."
The problem is that coal produces more carbon dioxide when burned than most other fossil fuels. Not that oil and gas are clean. Burning of the three fossil fuels is overloading the atmosphere with carbon dioxide, believed to be the chief e of global warming.
There is no technology available to contain the pollutant and no quick fix for the fossil fuel industries.
All of which makes executives more than a little nervous.
"It's absolutely frightening when you go to Ottawa and you hear senior government people saying: 'Coal is bad. Shut it down,' " says Richard Marshall, president of the Coal Association of Canada, which argues that burning coal more efficiently is the way to reduce emissions.
He and his associates are a long way from convincing their critics, who envision a world heated to deadly extremes by man-made carbon dioxide.
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has told the world that global carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced. And Mulroney is under considerable pressure to set an example by cutting carbon emissions at home.
The carbon dioxide issue is so explosive it threatens to set off a federal-provincial war: The coal with "no future" is concentrated in the Maritimes and the western provinces. It supplies more than 90 per cent of Alberta's electricity, employs 11,512 Canadians and is at the heart of a $2.2 billion industry.
Reducing carbon dioxide emissions also means the government will have to take on multi-national oil companies and the powerful automotive industry, which employs thousands of Canadians and sells more than a million cars and trucks a year.
And it means Canadian consumers could soon be paying a "carbon tax" every time they fill up their tanks with carbon-laden gasoline. A 2.5-cent-a-litre tax, being promoted by environmentalists and under study by the federal government, could generate $40 billion over the next 15 years to pay for energy conservation programs, renewable energy development and reforestation programs.
While public opinion polls indicate that consumers would be willing to pay such a tax, no one is pretending that introducing it or any other carbon-reducing measure is going to be easy.
"Dealing with the issue in the real world becomes politically very difficult . . . You run into a minefield of employment questions and inter-provincial jealousies," says Environment Canada's Henry Hengeveld, a top federal adviser on carbon dioxide and climate change.
There is sure to be a long and heated debate about how much more oil, gas and coal Canadian industry can and should extract from the ground. And there will be lengthy talks about the pros and cons of building more nuclear reactors, which have radioactivity problems but do not produce carbon dioxide pollution.
In the meantime, environmentalists say the Mulroney government should be doing more to promote energy conservation and to encourage use of biomass, solar and other forms of alternative energy.
Hengeveld agrees, saying: "It would be like buying insurance. Even if turns out we're all wrong about climate change, it (conservation and renewables) wouldn't do any harm."
Worldwide, man pumps an estimated 4.5 to 5.5 billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere each year in the form of carbon dioxide, largely through the burning of oil, gas, coal, and wood in the western world. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen by 25 per cent since the middle of the 19th century.
The debate is no longer if the world's atmosphere is changing but how fast, says Hengeveld: The five warmest years in the past century have occurred since 1980 with disastrous consequences on crop yields and world weather patterns.
There are dire forecasts about a hotter world if carbon emissions continue to climb. And emissions will rocket if China and India, home of a large portion of the world's coal reserves, proceed with plans to significantly increase their coal use in coming years.
All of which makes it important for developed nations, such as Canada, to lead the way by taking steps to control emissions, say Hengeveld and his associates.
This country produces little more than two per cent of the man-made carbon dioixide in the world. But Canadians are at the top of the list in terms of per capita production of carbon: More than four tonnes for every man, woman and child.
If Canada's current energy consumption - which is also the highest per capita in the world and twice that of Sweden - continues climbing, the country's carbon dioxide emissions can be expected to increase anywhere from 25 to 52 per cent by 2005, says Environment Canada consultant John Doucet, who is echoed by a recently released federal-provincial task force report on global warming.
Doucet estimates that by making optimum use of energy-conserving technology already available - lightweight cars, efficient refrigerators and industrial processes - Canada's energy consumption could be cut by 18 per cent by 2005 and carbon emissions by 22 per cent.
Increasing the use of wind, biomass and solar energy could result in even bigger savings - a 28- to 51-per-cent cut in carbon emissions depending on how far and fast the alternatives are introduced.
Environmentalists such as Kai Millyard of Friends of the Earth say the Conservatives' decisions to slash energy conservation programs and subsidize oil and gas megaprojects will see much unnecessary carbon heading into the already overloaded atmosphere.
Alberta's OSLO tar sands project, which has been promised $1.323 million in federal assistance, will produce crude oil that generates almost twice as much carbon per unit of energy as conventional oil, says Millyard, the global warming specialist at Friends of the Earth.
He and his associates also say that the Hibernia oil project in Newfoundland, which has been promised $3 billion in federal money, will aggravate the country's carbon pollution problems and at the same time create unfair competition for more environmentally sound energy systems that do not receive government subsidies.
Hengeveld sees a long battle ahead: "The core of the problem - that is fossil fuels - is the backbone of the industrial age."
One need not look far for evidence.
The gas stations dotting Canadian street corners and the pipelines traversing the country attest to the country's reliance on oil and gas.
Rail lines haul millions of tonnes of coal to power plants in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. At Roberts Bank in B.C., 20 million tonnes of coal are loaded on to ships each year bound for the furnaces at steel mills and power plants in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Brazil and Chile.
If plans to increase the port's capacity by 50 per cent a year proceed, 33 million tonnes of coal a year will be exported. Once burned, it could pump more than 30 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere.

Economist's approach to global warming dangerous: [Final Edition]

Abstract: He acknowledges that "scientific monitoring has firmly established the build-up of the main greenhouse gases." But as an economist, [William D. Nordhaus] thinks planetary climate is irrelevant to urban life: "Cities are increasingly becoming climate-proofed by technological changes like air-conditioning and shopping malls." With a faith in the capacity of human ingenuity to solve our problems and improve our lives, Nordhaus' choice to counter global warming is technology: "The option of climate engineering has been completely neglected. Possibilities include shooting particulate matter into the stratosphere to cool the earth, altering land-use patterns to change the globe's reflectivity, and cultivating carbon-eating organisms in the oceans." Nordhaus even suggests that we can adapt our lifestyles and economy to the unpredictable and chaotic consequences of global warming. My 10 days in England suggest that if the predicted warming does occur, it will be socially and economically disastrous.

Full text: Â  Headlines warn us of potential recession, change in the value of the dollar, rising interest rates, inflation and every tremor in the stock market.
In response, governments thrash about trying to find a magic formula for steady growth in the economy. Economists are arguably the most influential group of professional people in the world today as their every pronouncement carries vast repercussions. No wonder the planet is in such desperate shape.
Economists live in a dream world that bears no relationship to the things that keep us alive. Consider this.
I have just returned to Canada after sweltering through 10 days of a blistering heat wave in England that reached the highest temperature in English history - 37C - on Aug. 3, 1990. This could well eclipse 1989 as England's hottest year on record.
Scanning newspapers in England, I learned of record air pollution in cities, water shortages, increases in forest fires, increases in insurance claims for damage to homes, the collapse of market gardening, drownings and other heat-related deaths, skyrocketing prices of cheese and milk, and a drastic decrease in holiday bookings.
I can attest to the suffocating build-up of low-level ozone in London and chaos in train schedules as tracks buckled under the heat. That short heat wave had tremendous repercussions throughout English society.
Is the weather instability we seem to be seeing around the world merely the normal fluctuations of nature or the consequences of global warming?
Human activity has already significantly increased global temperature as P.D. Jones and T.M.L. Wigley report in the August 1990 edition of Scientific American. So what do economists have to say about it? Here is the response of Yale University professor William D. Nordhaus in The Economist of July 7, 1990.
He acknowledges that "scientific monitoring has firmly established the build-up of the main greenhouse gases." But as an economist, Nordhaus thinks planetary climate is irrelevant to urban life: "Cities are increasingly becoming climate-proofed by technological changes like air-conditioning and shopping malls."
The economic importance of industrialization apparently renders Americans exempt from the physical world: "Greenhouse warming would have little effect on America's national output. About three per cent of American GNP originates in climate-sensitive sectors as farming and forestry. Another 10 per cent comes from sectors only modestly sensitive - energy, water systems, property and construction. Far the largest share - 87 per cent - comes from sectors, including most services, that are negligibly affected by climate change."
Even though our very lives depend on nutrition that comes from agriculture that is very climate-sensitive, to Nordhaus, food can be written off: "For the bulk of the economy, however - manufacturing, mining, utilities, finance, trade and most services - climate change over the next few decades is likely to have less effect than the economic reunification of Germany this summer."
His reasoning is like concluding that since the stomach is a minor organ compared to the brain, we can do without it.
But what about the urgent warnings about increasing greenhouse gases? Here's Nordhaus' response: "All these prognostications are judgments based on immense uncertainties. They could be dead wrong. This uncertainty must affect mankind's choice of responses to the threat of global warming."
Since Nordhaus, like most economists, place the economy above all else when it comes to matters environmental, he finds the economic costs of meeting the greenhouse effect head on too great.
Nordhaus calculates the bill for a 60-per-cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at more than $300 billion annually.
With a faith in the capacity of human ingenuity to solve our problems and improve our lives, Nordhaus' choice to counter global warming is technology: "The option of climate engineering has been completely neglected. Possibilities include shooting particulate matter into the stratosphere to cool the earth, altering land-use patterns to change the globe's reflectivity, and cultivating carbon-eating organisms in the oceans."
He then dismisses the fact that "such measure would raise profound legal, ethical and environmental issues" because the technological attempts would also probably be far more cost-effective than shutting down the world's power plants."
There you have it folks, the world seen through the bizarre lenses of an economist.
We are grossly ignorant about the factors that shape climate and weather while history is full of examples of even the most benign of technologies having unpredictable and undesirable consequences when applied on a massive scale. It would be absolutely foolhardy to believe that we can come up with a technological fix for greenhouse warming.
Nordhaus even suggests that we can adapt our lifestyles and economy to the unpredictable and chaotic consequences of global warming. My 10 days in England suggest that if the predicted warming does occur, it will be socially and economically disastrous.
We have no choice. We must begin to massively cut down on greenhouse gas emissions now, else we leave our children to pay the disastrous price of trusting economists with their foolhardy ideas.

Imagine 200 gigantic marine farms - each roughly the size of New Jersey - that drift on the surfaces of the world's oceans. Or satellites bigger than Boston or San Francisco that beam solar energy back to Earth. Or so many tonnes of chemicals dumped into the atmosphere to cleanse it that the sky is bleached white.
These are just a few of the visionary schemes being dreamed up by some of the world's most brilliant scientists as possible ways to combat the global warming that is expected to occur as a result of the greenhouse effect.
While other researchers debate whether the planet has begun to heat up, these scientists are hard at work concocting planetary engineering projects costing hundreds of billions of dollars that they say could stabilize the Earth's climate if the greenhouse effect overheats the globe in the 21st century.
Among the proposals are these:
* Launching a fleet of 700 jumbo jets to disperse 35 million tonnes of sulfur dioxide droplets each year into the upper atmosphere - so many that they would turn the sky white. The droplets would form a massive shield over the planet, similar to a one-way mirror, that would reflect sunlight and help cool off the Earth.
* Building enormous floating beds of kelp _ all together, equivalent to five times the size of Texas - that would drift on the ocean's surfaces sucking up carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The marine plants could then be sunk to store the carbon dioxide at the ocean's bottom.
* Dumping 300,000 tonnes of iron pellets into the oceans. These pellets would fertilize "unproductive" parts of the ocean, providing the nutrients for tiny marine plants, which would absorb carbon dioxide. When the plants died, they would sink to the ocean's bottom. Fish eating the plants would excrete droppings containing carbon dioxide that also would sink.
* Constructing 375 satellites _ each containing 80 square kilometres of solar panels - that would orbit 35,900 km above the Earth. These satellites, built during the next 75 years, would generate electricity from sunlight and transmit this energy back to Earth on microwave beams. By eliminating the need for new power plants, they would reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide.
While some of the proposals seem fantastic, they are being seriously discussed by scientists in important journals and at prestigious workshops.
A paper discussing the iron-dumping proposal was published in the May 10 issue of Nature, a major British science journal. And a panel of U.S. researchers has recommended that at least two of the schemes be actively explored.
But some environmentalists are aghast at the proposals, which would be the largest efforts ever undertaken to manipulate nature. They fear that the ideas - if carried out - might cause irreparable damage to the planet.
Wallace Broecker, a geochemist at Columbia University and a proponent of the plan to dump sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, believes that the time has come to actively discuss such projects.
"As scientists we should be exploring all of the possible options. We need to develop insurance policies for the future."
Broecker said many scientists did not want to discuss these proposals because they believe the public is against climate engineering.
But Rodney M. Fujita, a staff scientist with the U.S. Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit group, said these schemes were dangerously misguided. "These proposals are bad ideas. They signify an arrogance towards nature. There are many simpler things that could be done to slow down global warming - such as improving energy efficiency, planting forests . . ."
Fujita said that virtually every effort people have taken to manipulate nature has backfired, causing unforeseen environmental consequences. "We don't know what we are doing. These proposals could have disastrous results."
Most climate-change scientists now believe that the average temperature of the Earth will increase in the next 100 years, according to a recent survey by the Global Environmental Change Report. The survey found that 76 per cent of the 330 scientists who participated believe that global warming caused by human activities has already begun; 90 per cent believe countries should take immediate steps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
The greenhouse effect is the name given to a theory that says temperatures will rise as carbon dioxide, methane and other gases build up in the atmosphere, much as a greenhouse traps solar heat. Among the effects are melting ice caps, rising seas, shifting of agricultural lands and changing weather patterns.
Of the proposals to counteract the greenhouse effect, the iron-dumping plan has received the most acceptance. An workshop on the subject was held late last year.The participants recommended that, "after careful modeling and appropriate preliminary experiments," a large international "iron-enrichment experiment" be conducted at a cost of between $50 million and $150 million. They suggested that the first experiments be conducted off the coast of Antarctica or Alaska.

Abstract: A more serious criticism of people concerned about global warming is the lack of hard evidence to back up their fears. The fact is, greenhouse gases have been accumulating in the upper atmosphere for decades and there has been a sharp increase in our output in recent years. Most climatologists believe that warming is already happening and will accelerate in the coming decades. But our ignorance about the factors influencing weather and climate is so great that is impossible to make a realistic scientific prediction. An editorial in the Globe and Mail (Oct. 12) headlined "What we don't know about global warming" warned that action to avert global warming would have vast economic repercussions. Citing the Marshall Institute report, the editorial concluded " . . . in the absence of more solid information on the dimensions of the danger, the proposed insurance premiums seem out of proportion to apparent risk." It must be pointed out that the Marshall Institute staunchly supported U.S. President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), which was overwhelmingly opposed by the scientific community as technologically impossible and an escalation in the arms race. At a scientific press conference in New York, I was astonished to witness physicist, Robert Jastrow, launch a vicious personal attack on a highly respected scientist who opposed SDI. Jastrow was one of the authors of the Marshall Institute report on global warming. One's position on global warming has become ideological.

Full text: The International Conference on Global Climate will convene in Geneva, Switzerland next week. The First Conference was held in Toronto in May 1988 and brought global warming into the political arena as Prime Minister Brian Mulroney opened the conference and spoke of the importance of the environment.
Participants warned about the unprecedented increase and accumulation of human-created greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, CFCs) that could cause forest die-off, desertification of farmland and sea-level rise. The conference adopted a proposal to reduce by 20 per cent carbon-dioxide production from 1988 levels within 15 years.
To date, Canada has done nothing and now the reality of the dangers is being questioned. The reasons for reluctance to reduce greenhouse gases are obvious - a serious effort will require a large investment, changes in lifestyle and a fundamental shift away from the relentless priority of growth.
The greenhouse effect is exaggerated, it is argued, because fluctuations in global temperature have occurred in the past while extinction is normal since 99 per cent of all species that ever lived are now extinct. These two points fail to consider the rate of change. The warming that ended the last ice age was of the order of a degree every millenium in contrast to possible coming changes of several degrees per century. And in the past, extinction rates were a species or two per year, while now we are already losing over two species per hour!
A more serious criticism of people concerned about global warming is the lack of hard evidence to back up their fears. The fact is, greenhouse gases have been accumulating in the upper atmosphere for decades and there has been a sharp increase in our output in recent years. Most climatologists believe that warming is already happening and will accelerate in the coming decades. But our ignorance about the factors influencing weather and climate is so great that is impossible to make a realistic scientific prediction.
Last year, the Marshall Institute, a right-wing think tank, published a paper that concluded that the temperature increase already observed over the past century merely resulted from the sun's variations. With greater evaporation and cloud formation, the article suggested, the earth would be shielded from sunlight and actually become cooler. The business magazine, Forbes, used the report to excoriate environmentalists for their alarmist exaggerations while U.S. President George Bush was persuaded to oppose the imposition of any targets for limiting emissions.
An editorial in the Globe and Mail (Oct. 12) headlined "What we don't know about global warming" warned that action to avert global warming would have vast economic repercussions. Citing the Marshall Institute report, the editorial concluded " . . . in the absence of more solid information on the dimensions of the danger, the proposed insurance premiums seem out of proportion to apparent risk."
It must be pointed out that the Marshall Institute staunchly supported U.S. President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), which was overwhelmingly opposed by the scientific community as technologically impossible and an escalation in the arms race. At a scientific press conference in New York, I was astonished to witness physicist, Robert Jastrow, launch a vicious personal attack on a highly respected scientist who opposed SDI. Jastrow was one of the authors of the Marshall Institute report on global warming. One's position on global warming has become ideological.
The interim report of the all-party Standing committee on Environment that was tabled last week put the issue of global warming into its proper perspective. While acknowledging the uncertainties of climate prediction, the committee members "nonetheless accept the argument that the precautionary principle must apply in so vital a situation.
"By the time scientists have all the answers to these questions, global climate may have been driven by human society to the point where the answers are largely academic."
The report goes on to warn of the reality of atmospheric change and sees "no validity in the argument that governments should delay acting until more detailed information on the likely effects of global climate is gathered . . . If the skeptics are correct and climate change is less of a problem than most scientists anticipate, the policies which we are proposing will still return many benefits, both environmental and economic."
Other countries are already acting. "West Germany has adopted the target of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions by 25 per cent in 2005 from 1987 levels; Denmark and New Zealand will attempt to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 20 per cent in 2000 from 1990 levels . . . the Committee concludes that the Toronto target - a 20 per cent reduction in the 1988 level of emissions by 2005 - is the minimum that Canada should strive for as an interim goal."
We should closely watch Canada's position in Geneva next week.

Abstract: OTTAWA (CP) - The federal government will set a national target and timetable by this fall for cutting carbon dioxide emissions, Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard said Tuesday. CARBON DIOXIDE is produced by burning fossil fuels and when forests are cut down more quickly than they are regrown. The gas traps heat from the sun. And many scientists say it will lead to unprecedented warming.

Full text: OTTAWA (CP) - The federal government will set a national target and timetable by this fall for cutting carbon dioxide emissions, Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard said Tuesday.
The move would be part of a federal strategy to fight global warming.
The strategy could force changes in many areas of Canadian life, from driving habits to home construction, from manufacturing to forest management.
"What are we going to do? We have no choice," Bouchard said after testifying on climate change before an extraordinary joint session of eight parliamentary committees.
"Even if the evidence is not conclusive . . . we still have to take out an insurance policy - the insurance policy to limit carbon dioxide emissions as much as possible."
CARBON DIOXIDE is produced by burning fossil fuels and when forests are cut down more quickly than they are regrown. The gas traps heat from the sun. And many scientists say it will lead to unprecedented warming.
But there continues to be great controversy about how fast the change will occur and what its effects will be.
Last month federal and provincial environment ministers decided it would be premature to set national targets for cutting carbon dioxide.
They said "the place to resolve the question of targets is in the context of international negotiations."
But Bouchard made it clear the Canadian target will be set independently of global negotiations.

Money-men can't save the world: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: Human activity has already significantly increased global temperature as P.D. Jones and T.M. Wigley report in the August 1990 edition of Scientific American. So what do economists have to say about it? Here is the response of Yale University professor William Nordhaus in The Economist of July 7, 1990. He acknowledges that "scientific monitoring has firmly established the build-up of the main greenhouse gases." But as an economist, Nordhaus thinks planetary climate is irrelevant to urban life: "CITIES ARE increasingly becoming climate-proofed by technological changes like air-conditioning and shopping malls." The economic importance of industrialization apparently renders Americans exempt from the physical world: "Greenhouse warming would have little effect on America's national output. About three per cent of American GNP originates in climate-sensitive sectors as farming and forestry. Another 10 per cent comes from sectors only modestly sensitive - energy, water systems, property and construction. Far the largest share - 87 per cent - comes from sectors, including most services, that are negligibly affected by climate change." WITH A FAITH in the capacity of human ingenuity to solve our problems and improve our lives, Nordhaus's choice to counter global warming is technology: "The option of climate engineering has been completely neglected. Possibilities include shooting particulate matter into the stratosphere to cool the earth, altering land-use patterns to change the globe's reflectivity, and cultivating carbon-eating organisms in the oceans."

Full text: Â  David Suzuki is a writer, TV and radio host and a geneticist
VANCOUVER - Headlines warn us of potential recession, change in the value of the dollar, rising interest rates, inflation and every tremor in the stock market.
In response, governments thrash about trying to find a magic formula for steady growth in the economy. Economists are arguably the most influential group of professional people in the world today as their every pronouncement carries vast repercussions. No wonder the planet is in such desperate shape.
Economists live in a dream world that bears no relationship to the things that keep us alive. Consider this.
I have just returned to Canada after sweltering through 10 days of a blistering heat wave in England that reached the highest temperature in English history - 37C - on Aug. 3, 1990. This could well eclipse 1989 as England's hottest year on record.
Scanning newspapers in England, I learned of record air pollution in cities, water shortages, increases in forest fires, increases in insurance claims for damage to homes, the collapse of market gardening, drownings and other heat-related deaths, skyrocketing prices of cheese and milk, and a drastic decrease in holiday bookings.
I CAN ATTEST to the suffocating build-up of low-level ozone in London and chaos in train schedules as tracks buckled under the heat. That short heat wave had tremendous repercussions throughout English society.
Is the weather instability we seem to be seeing around the world merely the normal fluctuations of nature or the consequences of global warming?
Human activity has already significantly increased global temperature as P.D. Jones and T.M. Wigley report in the August 1990 edition of Scientific American. So what do economists have to say about it? Here is the response of Yale University professor William Nordhaus in The Economist of July 7, 1990. He acknowledges that "scientific monitoring has firmly established the build-up of the main greenhouse gases." But as an economist, Nordhaus thinks planetary climate is irrelevant to urban life: "CITIES ARE increasingly becoming climate-proofed by technological changes like air-conditioning and shopping malls."
The economic importance of industrialization apparently renders Americans exempt from the physical world: "Greenhouse warming would have little effect on America's national output. About three per cent of American GNP originates in climate-sensitive sectors as farming and forestry. Another 10 per cent comes from sectors only modestly sensitive - energy, water systems, property and construction. Far the largest share - 87 per cent - comes from sectors, including most services, that are negligibly affected by climate change."
Even though our very lives depend on nutrition that comes from agriculture that is very climate-sensitive, to Nordhaus, food can be written off: "For the bulk of the economy, however - manufacturing, mining, utilities, finance, trade and most services - climate change over the next few decades is likely to have less effect than the economic reunification of Germany this summer."
His reasoning is like concluding that since the stomach is a minor organ compared to the brain, we can do without it.
But what about the urgent warnings about increasing greenhouse gases? Here's Nordhaus' response: "All these prognostications are judgments based on immense uncertainties. They could be dead wrong. This uncertainty must affect mankind's choice of responses to the threat of global warming."
Since Nordhaus, like most economists, place the economy above all else when it comes to matters environmental, he finds the economic costs of meeting the greenhouse effect head-on too great.
Nordhaus calculates the bill for a 60-per-cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at over $300 billion annually.
WITH A FAITH in the capacity of human ingenuity to solve our problems and improve our lives, Nordhaus's choice to counter global warming is technology: "The option of climate engineering has been completely neglected. Possibilities include shooting particulate matter into the stratosphere to cool the earth, altering land-use patterns to change the globe's reflectivity, and cultivating carbon-eating organisms in the oceans."
He then dismisses the fact that "such measure would raise profound legal, ethical and environmental issues" because the technological attempts would also probably be far more cost-effective than shutting down the world's power plants."
THERE YOU have it folks, the world seen through the bizarre lenses of an economist.
We are grossly ignorant about the factors that shape climate and weather while history is full of examples of even the most benign of technologies having unpredictable and undesirable consequences when applied on a massive scale. It would be absolutely foolhardy to believe that we can come up with a technological fix for greenhouse warming.
Nordhaus even suggests that we can adapt our lifestyles and economy to the unpredictable and chaotic consequences of global warming. My 10 days in England suggest that if the predicted warming does occur, it will be socially and economically disastrous.
We have no choice. We must begin to massively cut down on greenhouse gas emissions now, else we leave our children to pay the disastrous price of trusting economists with their foolhardy ideas.

Abstract: Holmes Refutes Pierce's Allegations State Finance Director Alexander Holmes got angry this week when Sen. Minority Leader Jerry Pierce, R-Bartlesville, said a lower appropriation estimate by the Office of State Finance was "political gamesmanship." Holmes was hired by Republican Gov. Henry Bellmon, an ardent supporter of the education tax increase which Pierce opposes. Participating communities are Boise City, Catoosa, Choctaw, Cordell, Crescent, Drumright, Eufaula, Fairview, Guymon, Mangum, Mannford, Muskogee, Newkirk, Oologah, Prague, Purcell, Sallisaw, Shattuck, Spiro, Stroud and Warr Acres, the chamber said.

Full text: To Hank, Hazel and Jim Bob (not their real names), legislative mumbo-jumbo about what to change in Oklahoma's workers compensation system can be difficult to understand.
One thing's for sure, however. These Oklahoma City employers believe they are bearing the brunt of the costs.
"I think we probably feel (about workers compensation) like everybody does about the IRS," Hazel said.
"They're out there, and there's nothing we can do to change it."
Hank and Hazel say high workers compensation benefits take away the incentive for employees who might abuse the system to return to work.
"The cases that cause the problems are the guys that really didn't get hurt. They're looking for the big cash payment," Hazel said.
Hazel and Hank once had an employee who filed a claim for a back injury, took off work and began collecting temporary total disability benefits.
The pair, who operate a building supply company, became suspicious because nobody witnessed the accident and the worker claimed to have fallen 45 feet, when the building was only 15 feet high.
So they hired a private investigator. Turned out the employee was working another full-time job.
Hank and Hazel said they were footing the bill. The only action taken against the worker, once the jig was up, was the severing of his benefits.
"They just cut off the weekly payments, and the bills had already been paid," Hazel said. "What could you do? You ought to be able to prosecute for fraud, but who would want to bear the cost?"
At the company where Jim Bob was vice president before he started his own business five years ago, an employee walked off the job one day and was gone about six months.
He returned, was re-hired and worked for less than a week before injuring his back, Jim Bob said.
"About two weeks later, I got a telephone call from the manager of an apartment complex," he said.
"He had put me down as a character reference for a job where he would be moving refrigerators and appliances, and he had filed a claim against our company."
Hazel was quick to add that most Oklahoma workers are good, decent, hardworking people.
"But it's the bad apples that are ruining the system," she said.
Added Hank: "The workers compensation laws in Oklahoma are so lenient, and so geared to the employee . . . if a guy gets himself in a financial crunch, all he has to do is file a workers comp claim."
Hazel said injured employees need to be rehabilitated and brought back to work.
"There's got to be some better guidelines of who pays, how much they pay and when they pay," she said.
Workers who fool the system are not the only thing that burns this trio.
"There are so many people involved," Hazel said. "Physicians, attorneys, insurance people - there are too many people in the middle wanting a piece of the pie. It's like big business."
Attorneys, she said, look forward to collecting one-third of the claim settlement.
"It's a vicious circle," said Jim Bob. "The insurance companies want to get out as cheap as they can, so rather than make an up-front settlement, they have to sue.
"There ought to be some way people could get a settlement without a lawyer getting one-third of it."
To these folks, finding out a prospective employee's history with the Workers Compensation Court is a matter of survival.
And, Hank and Hazel do not like a court policy instituted last summer that no longer allows employers to get information by telephone on prior claims filed by workers.
Hazel said she feared it would soon be impossible to find out if an individual had a history of filing claims.
"When that happens, we're not going to be able to hire any employees. We're going to be forced to go to people-leasing companies to get our workers," she said.
"They pick up the tab for everything, but we would pay big bucks for it."
Jim Bob agreed that employers need a way to screen prospective employees.
And, he said, "If a fellow came to me with the construction skills that I needed, and he had an injury of sorts, I don't think it would deter me from hiring him."
Michael Clingman, administrator of the State Workers Compensation Court, said the decision to quit giving claim information by telephone stemmed from a bill introduced last session in the House of Representatives.
The measure never made it to the House floor. However, at the request of some lawmakers, the court last July began a policy of providing claim information by mail. The request must be in writing and include the prospective employee's name and social security number, he said.
Responses are sent back by postcard, and with the overnight mail service in Oklahoma, Clingman said most employers should hear back from the court within 48 hours.
Clingman said the claims are looked up on a computer, which will show the employer up to five previous claims. The response will also show whether an award was made, he said.
The new policy results in greater accuracy than telephone inquiries, because employers often would only give social security numbers, he said. If the prospective employee had used a fake number, the information would be wrong.
Moreover, Clingman said the court was formerly fielding from 60-70 telephone requests an hour. The mail volume now averages about 100 requests per day, he said.
Employers who can't wait 48 hours can come to the court and look up the records, Clingman said.
House Bill 2257, by State Rep. Don McCorkell, is a 53-page attempt to get at the problems in Oklahoma's workers compensation system.
It is just possible that the nearly undecipherable language in the measure is a step toward addressing the complaints that Hazel, Hank and Jim Bob expressed so clearly.
The bill is scheduled to be considered Wednesday morning by the Commerce, Industry and Labor Committee of the Oklahoma House of Representatives. . .
Holmes Refutes Pierce's Allegations State Finance Director Alexander Holmes got angry this week when Sen. Minority Leader Jerry Pierce, R-Bartlesville, said a lower appropriation estimate by the Office of State Finance was "political gamesmanship."
Pierce, who staunchly opposes a $230 million education tax increase pending in the Senate, has said that he favors spending growth revenues on teachers and schools instead.
The finance office in December estimated growth revenues of $140.5 million. This week, the figure was amended downward to $131 million.
For Holmes, Pierce's comments were a personal attack.
"I heard you on the radio this morning," he wrote to Pierce on Feb. 21.
"I strongly resent that attack on the professionalism of the very fine and dedicated individuals in the Office of State Finance, the Tax Commission and other state agencies who labor diligently to provide the very best estimates of Oklahoma's future revenue collections."
In the letter, Holmes told Pierce that revenue estimates that are made each February are for collections that begin four months away, in July, and will end sixteen months away, on June 30.
Holmes said Oklahoma's revenue estimating process has generated some of the "finest estimates of any state in the nation."
"Your statements that revenue estimates are `cooked' demonstrate a complete ignorance of both the revenue estimating process and the ability to `cook books,' " Holmes wrote.
"There is no figure that more quickly shows itself to be false than a revenue estimate."
A table attached to the letter showed that estimation errors during Holmes's tenure have ranged between 3.4 and 4 percent, which Holmes said is "extraordinarily accurate."
"As Director of State Finance, I am extremely proud of the very fine professional work of the individuals who produce this report and the excellent service they provide for the citizens in estimating revenues," he concluded.
Holmes was hired by Republican Gov. Henry Bellmon, an ardent supporter of the education tax increase which Pierce opposes.
Pierce said the lower estimate of new money available for appropriation by the Legislature this year was a way to convince state senators to change their position on the tax increase. . .
Workers Compensation Overage Refunded The Oklahoma State Insurance Fund has mailed $4 million worth of dividend checks to Oklahoma business owners who have workers compensation insurance with the fund.
Fund Commissioner Dick Young said the dividends were made possible by continued lowering of administrative costs as a percentage of premium, along with increased safety in the Oklahoma workplace.
The largest single dividend check for $37,452 went to Charles Komar & Sons, Seamprufe Corp. of McAlester and Holdenville. . .
Twenty-three communities are participating in the Oklahoma Certified Cities program, which is run by the Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce and Industry through a contract with the Oklahoma Department of Commerce.
The program's focus is community preparedness as the first step in a successful economic development effort. Organizers try to help communities with growth at the local level.
Participating communities are Boise City, Catoosa, Choctaw, Cordell, Crescent, Drumright, Eufaula, Fairview, Guymon, Mangum, Mannford, Muskogee, Newkirk, Oologah, Prague, Purcell, Sallisaw, Shattuck, Spiro, Stroud and Warr Acres, the chamber said.
Clinton and Seminole, pilot communities, have completed their certification requirements and are ready for final certification. . .
Bellmon Plans to Attend Governors' Conference Gov. Henry Bellmon is scheduled to spend today through Tuesday in Washington, D.C. for the winter meeting of the National Governors' Association.
The meeting theme is "Consensus for Change: Setting National Goals." Governors will consider excellence in education objectives, global climate change and solid waste management.
The governors are scheduled to meet with President George Bush, Secretary of State James Baker, Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter, Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner, and Secretary of Energy James Watkins.
Bellmon is vice chairman of the Committee on Energy and Environment. He is also a member of the Committee on Transportation, Commerce and Communications, and the Task Force on Global Climate Change.

Full text: LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ It's time to do something about global warming, despite any scientific uncertainties about the problem, said experts at a conference who likened the action to an insurance policy.
"The potential danger is of such a nature that we should embark on ... energy conservation as quickly as we can," said Lennart Bengtsson, director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.
Bengtsson was one of more than a dozen experts on global climate change and related technologies who spoke Monday on the first day of a four-day Los Alamos National Laboratory conference.
Some speakers stressed the uncertainties about what is happening to the world's climate, but many said it is time to stress energy efficiency in both industrialized and developing nations.
Most scientists agree the world's climate has warmed by about 1 degree during the past century. Even a small change in temperature can greatly affect such things as precipitation, ocean levels and conditions for growing food.
According to Amory Lovins, director of research at the Rocky Mountain Institute in Snowmass, Colo., more than half of the global warming could be abated _ and money could be saved _ by available technologies that use energy far more efficiently.

Full text: As scientists and public officials urge painful, expensive measures to prevent climate change - reducing energy use, developing alternative sources of power, curbing production of destructive pollutants - a breed of visionaries is dreaming of more direct, if seemingly fantastic, countermeasures.
These experts are exploring extraordinary ways to combat pollution in the Earth's atmosphere and its threat of climatic upheaval.
They envision environmental wars fought with lasers that blast apart harmful chemicals, satellites that beam safe energy to Earth, micro-organisms that soak up pollutants and chemical-releasing airships that replace critical elements being removed from the Earth's atmosphere.
One aim is to counter the gases that produce the greenhouse effect, which is thought to be gradually warming the Earth, threatening to raise oceans and damage agricultural production.
Another is to halt the breakdown of the ozone layer, which blocks the sun's ultraviolet rays.
Work on futuristic cures for these pollution problems started in the 1970s and has accelerated in the 1980s as concern has grown about potential damage to the atmosphere.
Experts involved in the research stress that the ideas are often untested and in some cases could be risky.
Most experts agree that, for now, preventing the release of harmful gases into the sky deserves far higher priority than efforts to fix a damaged atmosphere.
Yet the surge of creative thinking, they add, could ultimately play an important role in the battle to stabilize the Earth's changing weather, especially if conditions take a dramatic turn for the worse.
``Some of this is mighty speculative,`` said Thomas H. Stix, a Princeton University physicist.
``But if we have a couple of summers like we just had, people are going to get pretty panicky over what we should do about it.``
Key questions are whether the techniques are safe and feasible, and, if so, whether the potentially huge cost of carrying them out would be economically justified.
In addition, some experts warn that large-scale intervention in the Earth's delicate and poorly understood cycles of climatic chemistry could trigger unwanted side effects.
Backers of the research say its value often lies not so much in sparking concrete plans as in inspiring thought about how, ultimately, to deal with climate problems.
``This area has been given little thought,`` said Wallace S. Broecker, professor of geochemistry at Columbia University.
``At a minimum, a rational society needs some sort of insurance policy on how to maintain a hant lasers atop mountains to scrub h the earth's atmosphere, a concept pioneered His lasers would be aimed at industrial chemicals known as chlorofluoroinly in refrigerants and in the manufacture of plastic foams.
Once released in the air, they rise high into the stratosphere, where Stratospheric ozone helps block ultraviolet light, which can cause skin cancer and eye damage and harm natural systems.
The laser system would break apart CFCs in the lower atmosphere before they had a chance to damage the ozone layer.
The concentrated light would be tuned to a frequency most easily absorbed by CFCs, which is in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Stix calculates that an array of infrared lasers around the world could blast apart as much as 1-million tons of CFC a year, equal to the current annual flow into the atmosphere.
In terms of feasibility, Stix said: ``Some of the answers are known. Many aren't. A major question is whether you can get the laser's energy absorbed by CFCs and not other molecules, such as water vapor or carbon dioxide.``
Another issue, he said, is to what extent the general atmosphere would absorb laser energy, limiting propagation of the beam.
A less exotic cure for ozone depletion would be simply to replace it.
Experts have proposed that bulk ozone be produced on Earth and lofted into the stratosphere in rockets, aircraft or balloons.
Other ideas include firing aloft ``bullets`` of frozen ozone, or placing solar-powered ozone generators in high-altitude balloons.
Since ozone consists of three oxygen atoms, and atmospheric oxygen has two such atoms, raw material would be plentiful.
Leon Y. Sadler, a chemical engineer at the University of Alabama, writing recently in Chemical and Engineering News, proposed using a fleet of jets to dispense ozone. e number of planes needed to replenish of the ozone would be equivalent to fewer than 2 percent of the aircraft that haul freight in the United States.
But other scientists have calculated that the job would be many times larger.
``Ozone replacement would be a really massive, massive thing to do,`` said Michael C. MacCrace importance of reducing emission of chemicals, as called for in a recent treaty.
On another front in the pollution war, scientists are proposing to counter the effects of carbon dioxide and other trace gases that are rapidly accumulating in the atmosphere.
These chemicals, the byproducts of fossil fuel combustion, other industrial activities and deforestation, trap heat from the sun that would otherwise be radiated back into space, acting like a greenhouse.
One way to thwart such gases would be to increase the reflectivity of the Earth's atmosphere so that more sunlight is reflected back into space, said Broecker, the geochemist at Columbia University.
Some of the proposals are drastic.
They include releasing millions of tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, covering much of the world's oceans with white Styrofoam chips, which would reflect more sunlight back into space than regular ocean water does, and painting the roofs of all houses white.
It is not known to what extent such actions might offset global warming.
While futurists clash over the best way to save the planet with exotic technologies, other experts warn that the debate should not deflect attention from the more pragmatic approaches to dealing with climate ills.
``It's reasonable to ask if there's anything to do to repair the damage,`` said said Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist at the Environmental Defense Fund, based in New York.
``But the effort and scale of some of these things is huge. It's probably cheaper in the long run to rely on prevention rather than unusual cures.``

Abstract: Environmentalists painted a gloomy picture of what global warming could mean to the Sunshine State as they started a public awareness campaign Wednesday. "Sea levels will rise," warned Estus Whitfield, a top aide to Gov. Lawton Chiles. "That will mean loss of property, contamination of water supplies, loss of businesses, loss of tourists, loss of beaches, loss of the economy and loss of the environment." Environmentalists and others have joined in a coalition called "Citizens to Preserve Florida" to increase awareness about the dangers posed by global warming.

Full text: Environmentalists painted a gloomy picture of what global warming could mean to the Sunshine State as they started a public awareness campaign Wednesday.
"Sea levels will rise," warned Estus Whitfield, a top aide to Gov. Lawton Chiles. "That will mean loss of property, contamination of water supplies, loss of businesses, loss of tourists, loss of beaches, loss of the economy and loss of the environment."
Environmentalists and others have joined in a coalition called "Citizens to Preserve Florida" to increase awareness about the dangers posed by global warming.
"The experts are saying that global warming is occurring and will continue to occur," Whitfield said.
The problem is human-induced, he said, citing power plants, autos, aerosol cans and air-conditioning systems as the sources of the greenhouse chemicals that work to trap heat. Carbon dioxide is the primary culprit with other contributors including methane, chlorofluorocarbons and nitrous oxide.
A proclamation signed by the governor designates Dec. 8-14 global awareness week because "Florida could suffer severe consequences from the effects of global warming, including a rise in sea level, frequent and more powerful hurricanes, changing weather patterns, contaminated drinking water and an increase in days over 90 degrees."
According to federal data, 1990 was Florida's hottest year on record and the first nine months of this year the second hottest period.
"In many ways Florida has more to lose from the global warming issue . . . than any other state, with our low-lying coast, our critical wetlands and our economic dependence on tourism," said Jim Murley, executive director of the group 1,000 Friends of Florida and a regional co-chair of the coalition.
Other organizations represented in the group include the League of Women Voters, Sierra Club, Florida Conservation Association and Florida Public Interest Research Group.
"If global warming is allowed to occur, the sea might rise about 2 feet on our coasts and bring with it monster hurricanes more often than they come now," said Lee Bidgood Jr., with the Florida Audubon Society. "It would cover our remaining scarce coastal wetlands. We would lose them. It would wipe out the beaches."
Carole Florman, staff director of the coalition, said Florida had an opportunity to lead the nation and, indeed, the world in fighting global warming. She compared the effort to taking out an insurance policy.
The coalition has set up a toll-free number for people who want to get involved at (800) 444-WARM.

Abstract: The students found the most substantial warming between February and May with an average increase of 1.8 degrees. By contrast they said there was no warming trend established for the fall months. The students documented an annual warming of 0.8 degrees during the period of study. Last year Professor Ting Chu at the University of Southern Florida received national recognition for his breakthrough in achieving a record 13.4 percent efficiency in a thin-film solar cell. Now he has broken that record, achieving a 14.6 percent efficiency with a modification in the cell. Increasingly, researchers are viewing the thin-cell technology as a leading candidate for the eventual low-cost, efficient and widespread application of photovoltaic technology. The goal of the photovoltaic program at the Colorado laboratory is to generate electricity at a cost of 6 cents per kilowatt hour within 10 years to compete with fossil fuel energy costs.

Full text: Â  Global warming will be a hot topic in Boston this week.
Scientists from around the world will gather at a three-day forum sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to explore the relationship between global warming and natural disasters.
Locally it's a topic that has gained the interest of a group of Nichols College students. Students in the college's Environmental Geology class have released their findings of a study into the warming of Worcester.
They compared climate records from Worcester Airport for the period 1956-79 to data collected on Airport Hill from 1980 to 1989 to determine if climate change had occurred.
They found that the average monthly temperatures during the 1980s were higher in 11 out of 12 months and that the monthly average for February during the 1980s was 3.1 degrees higher.
CONFIDENCE FACTOR
They calculated a confidence factor of 99.2 percent that the findings were significant.
The students found the most substantial warming between February and May with an average increase of 1.8 degrees. By contrast they said there was no warming trend established for the fall months. The students documented an annual warming of 0.8 degrees during the period of study.
They said that small change is noteworthy in that it is in line with a 0.6 degree global warming trend during the same period.
The idea that changing forces of nature brought about by global climate changes may significantly affect the occurrence and severity of natural hazards such as flooding, desertification, sea-level rises and droughts has prompted some interesting topics for discussion at the MIT forum this week.
TOPICS AT THE FORUM
Gerhard A. Berz, head of the Natural Hazard Research Center of the Munich Reinsurance Co., will discuss "Global Warming and the Insurance Industry."
"Potential Impact of Climate Induced Natural Disasters on the Construction Industry" will be explored by Ahar Kareem, professor of civil engineering from the University of Notre Dame.
Papers to be discussed at the conference also include "Potential Impacts of Stratospheric Ozone Depletion on Tropical Tourism."
Progress on the energy front, sponsored by Uncle Sam: The National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., has been achieving even more success in developing a more efficient and less costly solar power cell.
Last year Professor Ting Chu at the University of Southern Florida received national recognition for his breakthrough in achieving a record 13.4 percent efficiency in a thin-film solar cell. Now he has broken that record, achieving a 14.6 percent efficiency with a modification in the cell.
Thin film refers to the fine layers of semiconductor material used in making this type of solar electric cell.
DIFFERENCE IN COSTS
Efficiencies of up to 34 percent have been recorded for other photovoltaic technologies using other materials and designs. But their manufacturing costs are much higher than the thin-film cell made with cadmium telluride that Chu has developed.
Increasingly, researchers are viewing the thin-cell technology as a leading candidate for the eventual low-cost, efficient and widespread application of photovoltaic technology. The goal of the photovoltaic program at the Colorado laboratory is to generate electricity at a cost of 6 cents per kilowatt hour within 10 years to compete with fossil fuel energy costs.

Geneva meeting expected to heat up: [City Edition]

Abstract: An editorial in the Globe and Mail (Oct. 12) headlined "What we don't know about global warming" warned that action to avert global warming would have vast economic repercussions. Citing the Marshall Institute report, the editorial concluded " . . . in the absence of more solid information on the dimensions of the danger, the proposed insurance premiums seem out of proportion to apparent risk." At a scientific press conference in New York, I was astonished to witness physicist Robert Jastrow launch a vicious personal attack on a highly respected scientist who opposed SDI. Jastrow was one of the authors of the Marshall Institute report on global warming. One's position on global warming has become ideological. "West Germany has adopted the target of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions by 25 per cent in 2005 from 1987 levels; Denmark and New Zealand will attempt to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 20 per cent in 2000 from 1990 levels . . . the committee concludes that the Toronto target - a 20 per cent reduction in the 1988 level of emissions by 2005 - is the minimum that Canada should strive for as an interim goal."

Full text: Next week the Second International Conference on Global Climate will convene in Geneva, Switzerland.
The First Conference was held in Toronto in 1988 and brought global warming into the political arena as Prime Minister Brian Mulroney opened the conference and spoke of the environment's importance.
Participants warned about the unprecedented increase and accumulation of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, CFCs) that could cause forest die-off, de-certification of farmland and sea-level rise. The conference adopted a proposal to cut carbon- dioxide production by 20 per cent within 15 years, compared to 1988 levels.
To date, Canada has done nothing and now the reality of the dangers is being questioned. The reasons for reluctance to reduce greenhouse gases are obvious - a serious effort will require a large investment, changes in lifestyle and a fundamental shift away from the relentless priority of growth.
The greenhouse effect is exaggerated, it is argued, because fluctuations in global temperature have occurred in the past, while extinction is normal, since 99 per cent of all species that ever lived are now extinct.
These two points fail to consider the rate of change. The warming that ended the last ice age was of the order of a degree every millenium, in contrast to possible coming changes of several degrees per century. And in the past, extinction rates were a species or two per year, while now we are already losing over 2 species per hour!
A more serious criticism of people concerned about global warming is the lack of hard evidence to back up their fears. The fact is, greenhouse gases have been accumulating in the upper atmosphere for decades and there has been a sharp increase in it recently.
Most climatologists believe that warming is already happening and will accelerate in the coming decades. But our ignorance about the factors influencing weather and climate is so great that is impossible to make a realistic scientific prediction.
Last year, the Marshall Institute, a right-wing think tank, published a paper that concluded that the temperature increase already observed merely resulted from the sun's variations.
With greater evaporation and cloud formation, the article suggested, the earth would be shielded from sunlight and actually become cooler. The business magazine, Forbes, used the report to excoriate environmentalists for their alarmist exaggerations while U.S. President George Bush was persuaded to oppose the imposition of any targets for limiting emissions.
An editorial in the Globe and Mail (Oct. 12) headlined "What we don't know about global warming" warned that action to avert global warming would have vast economic repercussions. Citing the Marshall Institute report, the editorial concluded " . . . in the absence of more solid information on the dimensions of the danger, the proposed insurance premiums seem out of proportion to apparent risk."
It must be pointed out that the Marshall Institute staunchly supported former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), which was overwhelmingly opposed by the scientific community as technologically impossible and an escalation in the arms race.
At a scientific press conference in New York, I was astonished to witness physicist Robert Jastrow launch a vicious personal attack on a highly respected scientist who opposed SDI. Jastrow was one of the authors of the Marshall Institute report on global warming. One's position on global warming has become ideological.
The interim report of the all-party Standing committee on Environment that was tabled last week put the issue of global warming into its proper perspective. While acknowledging the uncertainties of climate prediction, the committee members "nonetheless accept the argument that the precautionary principle must apply in so vital a situation. By the time scientists have all the answers to these questions, global climate may have been driven by human society to the point where the answers are largely academic."
The report goes on to warn of the reality of atmospheric change and sees "no validity in the argument that governments should delay acting until more detailed information on the likely effects of global climate is gathered . . . If the skeptics are correct and climate change is less of a problem than most scientists anticipate, the policies which we are proposing will still return many benefits, both environmental and economic."
Other countries are already acting.
"West Germany has adopted the target of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions by 25 per cent in 2005 from 1987 levels; Denmark and New Zealand will attempt to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 20 per cent in 2000 from 1990 levels . . . the committee concludes that the Toronto target - a 20 per cent reduction in the 1988 level of emissions by 2005 - is the minimum that Canada should strive for as an interim goal."
We should closely watch Canada's position in Geneva next week.

Full text: Â  Your editorial "This Is No Way to Run a Nuclear Power Plant" [Aug. 30! is bound to leave readers with the impression that, faced with the prospect of global climate change, we at the National Audubon Society have pinned our hopes on a new type of nuclear technology.
In my testimony to the House energy subcommittee, I made it clear that "the most practical program for solving the greenhouse problem in the next century involves . . . (on the demand side) improved energy efficiency and materials recycling, and (on the supply side) emphasis on direct solar technologies, such as photovoltaics."
Finally, I stated that, despite the high promise of direct solar power, there still remains enough uncertainty about our ability to rely totally on renewable energy as a future resource that some level of continued long-term research into future applications of other technologies is warranted.
It is in this sense - as a sort of global-warming insurance policy in case the transition to renewable energy systems fails to materialize - that I recommend that some small amount be made available for investigating the possibility of advanced, safe nuclear reactors. Even here, I was careful to point out that the "allocation of research funds . . . should reflect the low probability that any kind of nuclear option will prove both commercially viable and sufficiently idiotproof to overcome public concern about the safety of the nuclear fuel cycle."
Furthermore, there is an essential difference between research, which we support, and development, which we do not. Development means actually building a commercial reactor. In no way are we prepared to support the building of any commercial reactors now. We are in favor of limited research - in other words, finding out if there is such a thing as an inherently safe nuclear reactor.

Full text: Â  President George Bush yesterday released his first full-year budget - a $1.23-trillion package for fiscal 1991 - designed to boost the nation's future competitiveness through initiatives in research and development, education, space exploration and the environment while still cutting the federal deficit by $37 billion.
Calling the plan "an investment in the future," Bush unveiled a proposal to increase the nation's savings rate through a "Family Savings Account" - originally a 1988 campaign promise that would allow middle-income families to save up to $5,000 a year for seven years and earn tax-free interest.
Other investment-related proposals included a change in individual retirement accounts to permit first-time home buyers to withdraw without penalty up to $10,000 for the purchase of homes and a revival of Bush's long-standing promise to wealthier Americans - a cut in capital gains taxes.
The Bush budget sets spending at $1.23 trillion and revenues at $1.17 trillion, resulting in a deficit of $63.1 billion - well within the $64-million target prescribed under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget act.
"This year's budget meets the responsibility to be serious," budget director Richard Darman wrote in a lengthy preface to the budget. "Its emphasis on investment and growth-oriented policies and its realistic attention to long-term liabilities should be welcome. It meets [budget! targets . . . without gimmicks."
Like last year, the fiscal 1991 budget contains no major tax increase to pay for these new initiatives. But the spending plan instead relies heavily both on hefty spending cuts in popular social programs, including a $5.5-billion Medicare reduction, and on what have been described by critics as rosy forecasts on economic growth and interest rates during 1990. The Bush budget also called for cuts in other favorite targets of former President Ronald Reagan's administration, including mass transit.
Moreover, a long-anticipated "peace dividend" from reduced defense spending did not materialize, with the administration instead calling for increased spending on some high-technology weapons systems, such as the Strategic Defense Initiative and the Trident nuclear submarine. The overall 1991 defense spending was cut by little more than 2 percent, because it was not increased for inflation. The administration recommended the closing or scaling back of some 60 military bases in the United States, almost all of which were located in Democratic congressional districts - a move that saves almost no money in fiscal 1991 but has drawn heavy fire from Congress.
"If we find out they are trying to play real games . . . it could really undermine his relationship with Congress," said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D-Calif.), whose own district may lose Ft. Ord because of a proposed relocation of the Army's Seventh Division to Ft. Lewis in Washington State.
Panetta and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) lashed into the Bush budget at a joint news conference yesterday, calling it a disappointment for failing to provide leadership.
"It's like the doctor who tells the patient that he's suffering from terminal cancer and tells him to `take two aspirins and see me in the morning,' " Panetta said. "Well, this is the take-two-aspirins-and-see-me-in-the-morning budget instead of the major surgery we need to confront the deficit issue."
While commending Bush on his call for investment in the future, Panetta said Bush has not provided the money to pay for his initiatives.
Both Democrats said new taxes were going to be necessary but that Bush was not as aggressive as he should have been in his spending cuts. Sasser, who has argued that this is the year to realize a sizable peace dividend in light of the changing political climate in Eastern Europe, said that the Bush budget looked as if "Joe Stalin had come back and entrenched himself in the Kremlin."
Sasser said he would look for cuts in some major weapons systems, including new attack submarine development, the Strategic Defense Initiative and the MX and Midgetman intercontinental ballistic missiles.
The Democrats, repeating criticisms they lodged throughout the Reagan years, also charged the Bush administration with relying on rosy assumptions about the direction of the economy. While congressional budget analysts have estimated that the fiscal 1991 budget deficit will be about $138 billion, the Bush administration has started its deficit reduction efforts from a $100 billion 1991 baseline.
The difference between the two estimates is based on more optimistic predictions by the Bush administration on the level of interest rates and economic growth this year. At a budget briefing yesterday, the president's chief economist Michael Boskin acknowledged the discrepancy in forecasts, but countered that the administration's 1989 mid-year review turned out to be "dead-on" in its forecasts on growth and rates, despite enduring the same criticism last year when it released its estimates.
One of the highlights of Bush's future-oriented program was his call for increased spending on space exploration. In space activities, Bush asked for a 17.5 percent increase for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, including $2.6 billion for the space station the agency wants to start building in Earth orbit in 1995.
The budget also includes a $408 million increase in research on the technologies that will be needed to send American astronauts back to the moon and eventually on to Mars.
In other research initiatives, Bush proposed to increase spending on AIDS research by $749 million to $3.2 billion.
On the environment, Bush proposed increased spending to buy new public lands, do research on global climate change, protect wetlands and clean up polluted federal facilities. He also proposed a 12 percent increase in the Environmental Protection Agency's budget and asked for $175 million to start a new program to plant a billion trees a year on private lands.
Also in the budget:
Bush asked for authority to spend a total of $24.6 billion for education programs in fiscal 1991, which runs from Oct. 1, 1990, to Sept. 30, 1991. Proposed budget outlays would be slightly lower, amounting to $23.4 billion, or $1.6 billion more than the government will spend in fiscal 1990. Authority includes money that has been obligated to a program to be spent that year and in future years. Outlays are for one year.
"Education is going to be at a record-high level," said budget chief Darman.
Many of the increases for education were targeted at poor children.
The Head Start program, which provides comprehensive educational, medical and nutritional services for preschool-age children, would receive a total of $1.9 billion in fiscal year 1991, a 36-percent increase over 1990.
But funding for guaranteed student loans would decline by almost $700 million nationwide and some $56 million in New York State, according to an analysis of Bush's budget by Rep. Charles Schumer (D-Brooklyn), a member of the House Budget Committee.
Darman, however, attributed the apparent decrease in the program to reduced costs associated with lower interest rates that the administration expects to be in effect in the next fiscal year.
The Department of Health and Human Services would be in for stiff cuts, according to the Bush budget.
Medicare spending for the coming fiscal year would total $110.5 billion, roughly $10 billion more than the current year but $5.5 billion less than provided by existing federal law. Proposed legislation would trim $3.34 billion from Medicare payments to hospitals and $2.5 billion from payments to doctors, compared with levels that would be provided under current law.
Medicare payments have doubled every five years since 1975, the document said, and "unless policies are implemented to stem this growth, spending on Medicare will exceed spending on Social Security retirement and defense soon after the turn of the century." *****(The following appeared in C edition: "...Our health care system is in need of a fundamental course correction," HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan told a budget briefing)
For the Department of Transportation, Bush asked for a total of $26.9 billion, a 9-percent increase over the administration's funding proposal for fiscal 1990, but still $1.2 billion less than Congress authorized in department spending. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner yesterday acknowledged that Congress probably would restore some of Bush's proposed cuts in operating subsidies for mass transit systems in large cities.
The Department of Justice's $9 billion budget request - a 4.2 percent increase over last year - would pour money into the drug war. The department would add 380 Drug Enforcement Administration agents by the end of the fiscal year and would increase, by 102, the number of FBI agents devoted to drug enforcement. The budget proposal also includes money to hire 234 new assistant U.S. attorneys. ***** The Budget's Winners and Losers WINNERS Head Start. 36 percent increase to $1.9 billion to enable program to enroll up to 70 percent of eligible poor 4-year-olds.

Full text: Â  To investors, the world's economy for the 21st Century looks hot. Hot literally, that is - courtesy of the so-called greenhouse effect.
It appears likely to some scientists that vast man-made global climate changes, left unchecked, will increase the earth's temperature, raise ocean levels to city-swamping heights and send hurricanes and droughts through once-mild regions.
And it appears equally likely to some investors that this will change the climate for investment possibilities. "The impact of the greenhouse effect and of sea-level rise on investors is not limited just to the flooding of Wall Street," said Jim Titus, who studies oceans for the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington.
Today, in what may be the nation's first such gathering, , a hundred people who handle the investments for insurance companies, colleges and pension funds are expected to crowd into a midtown Manhattan conference room to listen to scientists talk about the possible effects of global warming.
Then, in the afternoon, they will turn to investment options in energy, transportation and real estate.
"We think that the issue of global climate change may have profound investment impact on the 21st Century," said Douglas Cogan, manager of the environment program for the Investor Responsibility Research Center of Washington, D.C., which is co-sponsoring the forum with the World Resources Institute.
The greenhouse effect, first predicted in the 1890s and documented in the 1980s, results largely from the burning of fossil fuels, which send huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide absorbs infrared light, converting it to heat.
By the year 2030, according to one scenario developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the number of days in New York that exceed 90 degrees could increase from 14 in the 1980s to 33. That means, at the least, New Yorkers of the next century would likely demand more air conditioning.
But the impact of warmer air does not stop there. Researchers say:
A warmer atmosphere also warms the ocean, causing it to expand. Based on current levels of fossil fuel consumption, the ocean could rise at a rate of between three to five feet a century.
As sea level rises, tidal water is pushed farther up freshwater rivers, such as the Hudson. Water that was once fresh for drinking could turn salty, and cities would have to look elsewhere for drinking water supplies.
Rising seas could wash away beaches and buildings from coastal areas. The EPA's Titus said barrier islands and sand spits - such as Coney Island and the Rockaway peninsula - could erode, "then roll up like a rug and move farther inland."
As always, one person's environmental catastrophe can be another's investment opportunity. And the investors at the conference will be focusing on profitable ways to mitigate the effects of the greenhouse effect.
Top on that list is searching for a profitable alternative to fossil fuels for automobiles and for generating electricity, Cogan said. The group will explore everything from compressed natural gas to solar energy, and will take a second look at nuclear power.
Then there are the far-ranging consequences of the greenhouse effect on real estate. Beyond the obvious effects on coastal areas, rising ocean levels jeopardize sewage treatment plants, reservoirs, storm sewers and underground subway tunnels. Low-lying areas, such as Kennedy Airport, may have to be diked in the future to keep water away.
"Highways may have to be rebuilt, buildings may have to be jacked up. All of a sudden cities may have to be making massive improvements in infrastructure because of their own proximity to the sea," Cogan said.
One forum attendee will be Nancy Anderson, an environmental policy analyst for the city comptroller's office.

U.S. Urged to Cut Greenhouse Gases: [NASSAU AND SUFFOLK Edition]

Full text: Â  Despite uncertainty about the risks of global warming, the United States should take low-cost steps that could reduce its output of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases by up to 40 percent, an expert panel recommended yesterday.
The report by a panel of the National Academy of Sciences found that "greenhouse warming is a potential threat sufficient to justify action now."
The call by the prestigious panel for even limited measures is likely to put renewed pressure on the Bush administration, which has resisted setting up programs aimed specifically at global warming and has called for more research.
Many scientists believe that emissions of industrial gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) could produce an increase in average global temperatures of from 2 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century unless preventive measures are taken.
"We know neither the timing, magnitude, nor severity of earthquakes, but we buy insurance to limit the consequences," said former Sen. Daniel J. Evans of Washington, head of the panel. He said the proposed steps "represent a planetary insurance policy, maybe even a planetary life insurance policy."
The panel stopped short of recommending fixed limits on carbon dioxide emissions or punitive energy taxes, steps that have been urged by environmental groups and supported by some European governments.
Its recommendations include improved energy-efficiency standards for industry and households; reduced reliance by utilities on fossil fuels such as coal and oil; better mileage efficiency in cars, and planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The options are similar to those outlined in other studies, including a recent report by the congressional Office of Technology Assessment. That study estimated that the U.S. could cut up to 35 percent of its carbon dioxide output in 25 years without technological breakthroughs or huge energy taxes.
William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the new report "advances our understanding of one of the biggest environmental issues we confront." He said in a statement that "the Bush administration will seriously review and consider" the recommendations.
The administration announced an "action agenda" in February to cut emissions of some heat-trapping gases to 1987 levels by the turn of the century. Michael Deland, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said at the time that "the potential threat of climate change justifies taking action now." But critics have accused the White House of essentially repackaging some programs aimed at other purposes, such as the reduction of CFCs to prevent loss of stratospheric ozone.
Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist for the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, praised the new report. "It makes the very important point that reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be done in a way which actually saves Americans money." The report did not offer a total cost estimate for its recommendations, but Evans said in many cases the investment will be recouped in reduced energy costs and other savings.
The report also urged the United States to resume an active role in international programs to control population, which Evans called "the single biggest driver of atmospheric pollution."

Abstract: Revenue Raisers UPPER-INCOME TAXPAYERS Raise the official income-tax rate for taxpayers in the highest income brackets to 31% from 28%. Some taxpayers who currently pay marginal rates of 33% would receive a rate-cut to 31%. Create another tax "bubble" by phasing out the personal exemption, now $2,050 per person, for affluent taxpayers. This would be done by raising the top tax rate by 0.5% for each exemption on incomes between $150,000 and $275,000 for couples and families, and between $100,000 and $225,000 for singles. Disallow $300 in deductions for every $10,000 in gross income above $150,000 for couples or $100,000 for singles, raising marginal tax rates for those affected by about 0.9% CAPITAL GAINS: Cap the maximum capital gains tax rate at 28%, instead of current maximum of 33%. MEDICARE: Extend 1.45% Medicare payroll tax to wages up to $125,000 from current $51,300 ceiling. Adjust Part B premium to cover 25% of program costs, rising from $28.60 a month this year to a projected $46.50 in 1995. GASOLINE: Boost the federal gas tax, now 9 cents a gallon, by 5 cents. TOBACCO: Increase the current 16-cent-a-pack cigarette tax by 4 cents in 1991 and another 4 cents in 1993. ALCOHOL: Raise the liquor tax by $1.20 a proof gallon. Boost the beer tax by 16 cents a six-pack. Increase the table wine tax by 22 cents a bottle. LUXURIES: Impose a new 10% tax on the price above $30,000 for cars, $100,000 for boats, $5,000 for jewelry, $10,000 for furs and $250,000 for planes. LOW INCOME TAX BREAKS: Increase earned-income tax credit for working poor by $13 billion over five years. OTHER TAXES: Impose a new "gas-guzzler" tax on cars whose gasoline mileage is less than 15 m.p.g. Increase airline ticket tax to 10% from 8%. Impose Social Security and Medicare payroll tax on state and local government workers beginning in 1991. BUSINESS TAX: Offer new tax incentives for oil and gas exploration if oil prices fall below $34 a barrel. Deny corporate deduction for interest paid on tax underpayments. Increase tax for insurers. Increase railroad retirement payroll tax. Renew expiring tax credits through end of next year, include credit for research and development, health insurance for self-employed and low-income housing.

Full text: Senate and House conferees began ironing out final details of a new deficit reduction package Thursday, hoping to send the measure to President Bush for his signature by the end of this week. But the proposal hit another last-minute snag.
The package, embraced informally by House Democrats on Wednesday, was supposed to have sailed through both houses. The House Democrats had been the largest bloc opposed to previous plans. Their endorsement of the new plan was taken as a sign that a compromise was at hand.
But the effort ran into difficulty again Thursday as Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) and other senators objected to specifics of proposed tax increases on upper-income Americans, renewing the bargaining between the Senate and the House.
Although leaders on both sides still are hopeful that Congress will be able to complete a budget package by the weekend, it was clear Thursday night that the dispute will require another day-or possibly two-to resolve.
Senate members of a conference committee sent their House counterparts a new proposal late Thursday offering to change provisions in the House plan for increasing taxes on the rich. They also proposed that gasoline taxes be raised another 2 cents if oil prices rise.
In particular, the senators objected to a provision in the House plan dubbed the "family tax," which raises the top tax rate by half a percentage point for each personal exemption claimed on a high-income return.
They also differed over another provision that would disallow $300 in deductions for every $10,000 in gross income above $100,000 for single taxpayers or $150,000 for couples-a move that would raise the marginal tax rates for those affected by 0.9%.
Thursday night, Senate negotiators proposed increasing tax rates by a full percentage point for each $2,500 of adjusted gross income above $100,000 for single taxpayers and $150,000 for joint filers.
They also proposed disallowing itemized deductions equal to 4% of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income in excess of $125,000 a year. The House has a similar provision.
It was not immediately clear how the bargaining would turn out, but congressional strategists seemed confident Thursday that the two houses would be able to agree on a compromise budget by the end of this week. Such wrangling occurs often before adjournment.
Bentsen and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) began meeting privately late Thursday in an effort to work out a compromise tax package. Rostenkowski said he hopes to reach an agreement quickly on two-thirds of the package.
House and Senate leaders said they had encountered increased pressure on negotiators to reach a compromise because lawmakers want to hit the campaign trail during the last 10 days before Election Day.
Although disputes continued over other parts of the package-including oil drilling tax breaks and other business tax incentives-the major components appeared to have enough support to pass both chambers as one of the last acts of the stormy 101st Congress.
Even while negotiators scurried around the Capitol, however, a jogging Bush told reporters that he was "feeling good" about the five-year agreement that has caused him so much political pain.
"The President does believe this budget report is a historic bipartisan agreement," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. "Although the process has been somewhat tortuous, we can believe there has been solid achievement."
On Capitol Hill, most Democrats exulted over the still-tentative accord and said it was far more fair to middle-income and lower-income taxpayers than the budget plan worked out by White House officials and congressional leaders, then defeated by the House Oct. 5.
"It's about as good as we can do," Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) said. "It's far more progressive, less onerous on the middle class and it's not trying to reduce the deficit on the backs of the elderly."
One factor that appeared to be holding up quicker action on the package was the sheer complexity of some of the provisions. Many lawmakers continued to complain Thursday that they still did not understand some of the proposals and there were few documents to explain them.
Democratic strategists said they anticipate enough support from their 258 House members, combined with some GOP votes, to pass the package without great difficulty. Republicans predicted that about 50 to 60 of their number will support the plan.
"They recognize there isn't another door to choose from," Rep. Jack Buechner (R-Mo.) said. "The only other door is to shut the government down-the constituents won't accept that."
The newest part of the package-dubbed PEP, for personal exemption phase-out-puzzled many members of Congress. Some quickly labeled it the "family tax" because it appeared to punish upper-income people with large numbers of dependents.
The bill would gradually take back from the well-to-do the tax savings from personal exemptions, which are set at $2,050 this year. The effect would be to boost the top tax rate on these taxpayers by half a percentage point for each exemption.
Once a single person's taxable income (after exemptions and deductions) rose to more than $100,000, for example, he or she would pay at a 31.5% rate. The value of exemptions would be phased out completely at the $225,000 level.
For couples with no children, the benefit would be phased out between $150,000 and $275,000 of income. At that point, they would be paying 33%.
Another controversial change would limit certain itemized deductions for individuals with incomes of more than $100,000 and couples with incomes of more than $150,000.
For each $10,000 in income above the cutoff level, the proposal would reduce allowable deductions by $300, or 3%.
The new plan would cap the tax rate for capital gains-profits from the sale of stocks or other assets-at 28%. Under current law, capital gains are treated as ordinary income, and taxpayers pay anywhere from 28% to 33%.
Meanwhile, key lawmakers said a new $2.5-billion child care program will be incorporated in the omnibus budget package as well.
Under the program, block grants to states will provide direct assistance to low-income families as well as support to schools and community agencies that provide child care.
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) said House leaders had agreed to the three-year compromise program negotiated by senators and Administration officials earlier this month.
Dodd said assistance could be provided for 750,000 children in the first year. Part of the funds would go for early childhood education and "latchkey" after-school care in schools or at facilities run by community groups.
In a related action, the Senate approved, 60 to 36, the 1990 farm bill and sent the legislation to Bush. The bill would cut crop subsidy payments in line with the deficit reduction agreement.
The five-year, $40.8-billion farm measure had been approved by the House on Tuesday, 318 to 102. The legislation would reduce subsidized acreage by 15% to meet a target of $13 billion in farm subsidy reductions over the next five years. It also would require farmers to keep records of hazardous pesticide use and authorize the first effort to assess the threat of global climate change on agriculture.
A provision in the original Senate bill that would have prohibited export sales of pesticides banned or unregistered in the United States was dropped from the final version of the bill. Among other things, the measure would establish a program for protecting 25 million acres of private forest land and create national standards for organic farming.
Although the deficit reduction plan embraced by House Democrats would scrap a proposed surtax on millionaires that some liberals had wanted, it would place a high burden on people with incomes of $200,000 or more.
Except for higher excise taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, alcoholic beverages and airline tickets, people with earnings of less than $50,000 generally would be spared additional income tax hikes.
Still to be worked out, however, are details of a roughly $13-billion expansion of the earned income tax credit. The money would go to low-income working families with children but would not be tied directly to child care expenses.
Some legislators also were seeking an additional program of child care assistance for poor families that would become an entitlement program under Title 4 of the Social Security Act.
The price tag on that would be $1.5 billion over five years. Rep. Thomas J. Downey (D-N.Y.) said the money could come from scaling back the earned income tax credit.
And, on a related issue, tax writers remained split over whether to make the existing dependent care tax credit "refundable" and thus available to those with incomes too low to take advantage of the credit.
The gasoline tax issue is particularly sensitive in California because the state already is boosting gasoline taxes by 5 cents a gallon with additional 1-cent increases scheduled at the first of each year through 1994.
Here are the major tax provisions of the compromise that House Democrats proposed:
-An increase of 5 cents a gallon in the existing 9-cent federal gasoline tax.
-Two 4-cent increases in the 16-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes. The first would take effect Jan. 1 and the second would be imposed two years later.
-A doubling of the 16-cent tax on a six-pack of beer, a 25-cent tax on a bottle of table wine and an increase of $1.50, or perhaps slightly more, on a proof gallon of liquor.
-A rise in the airline ticket tax from 8% to 10%.
-A luxury tax of 10% on very high-priced automobiles, yachts, planes, jewels and furs. The tax would apply only to the price of cars above $30,000 and furs above $10,000.
-An increase in the 1.45% health insurance payroll tax by applying it to the first $125,000 of earnings rather than the current ceiling of $51,300.
-A new top-bracket rate of 31%, which would be a tax increase for an estimated 600,000 people with incomes of more than $200,000 a year but a cut in tax rates for about 3.5 million others now in the so-called "tax bubble" ranging from about $80,000 to $188,000 for a couple.

Global Warming Action Seen Not Urgent Environment: Researchers say that measures can be delayed for 10 years without significant adverse effects. They caution against inaction, however.: [Home Edition]

Abstract: Micheal E. Schlesinger, a co-author of the study and of a previous United Nations report on climate change, said the insignificance of the temperature change-a difference of less than 5% of what it would be if steps were taken immediately-justifies postponing major action until scientists better understand the sensitivity of the climate to greenhouse gases. Schlesinger cited a previous study that indicated the United States might have to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 18th-Century levels to stabilize levels in 2030. Carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of fossil fuels, such as oil and coal. [Ralph Cicerone] noted, however, that Schlesinger wrote the report before a more recent study by scientists in Stockholm and Seattle indicated that air pollution from sulfur emissions may have prevented the Northern Hemisphere from warming even more during this century. That study suggests that global warming may be an even greater threat than previously believed because the Earth will warm more as steps to reduce air pollution take effect.

Full text: Measures to combat global warming can be delayed for 10 years without significantly affecting future worldwide temperatures, according to a new study published in Nature today.
The study, by scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is likely to strengthen attempts by the Bush Administration to postpone potentially costly measures to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
If nothing is done for 10 years, temperatures will rise only slightly more than they otherwise would have by the year 2100, the report said.
The authors, however, cautioned against inaction.
"The study of the greenhouse effect, both theoretically and observationally, should be accelerated into a crash program so that we do not squander the time that nature has given us," they wrote.
The finding was based on calculations that tried to predict the future's climate by taking into account the last 120 years of temperatures. There is a lag of 50 to 100 years before temperatures rise in response to greenhouse emissions.
At least 20 industrialized nations have called for steps to reduce or stabilize gases that contribute to global warming. The United States, however, has resisted setting targets for cutbacks as urged by environmentalists. Such cutbacks could require huge reductions in energy use.
Not surprisingly, environmental groups criticized the Nature study, saying delays would lead to more costly measures in the future. Sen. Al Gore (D-Tenn), a proponent of strong measures to head off warming, released a statement saying the world can not afford to wait.
But Micheal E. Schlesinger, a co-author of the study and of a previous United Nations report on climate change, said the insignificance of the temperature change-a difference of less than 5% of what it would be if steps were taken immediately-justifies postponing major action until scientists better understand the sensitivity of the climate to greenhouse gases.
For instance, he notes, predictions of temperature increases in the next century range from minor to catastrophic.
Schlesinger cited a previous study that indicated the United States might have to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 18th-Century levels to stabilize levels in 2030. Carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of fossil fuels, such as oil and coal.
"You don't want to move in that direction until you have fairly good evidence that it is the direction you have to move in . . ." he said Wednesday. "If you want to protect your family, you are going to buy life insurance, but you are not going to buy 10 times more than you need."
Schlesinger said his calculations are good news because they show there is enough "leeway to to do further scientific study to narrow down the uncertainty."
The professor, who conducted the study with graduate researcher Xingian Jiang, said it provides a case for a phased approach to reducing emissions, not an argument for doing nothing. "If we squander the time we have, then it will be too late," he said.
An Administration source who asked not to be identified said the study appeared to justify President Bush's go-slow approach and would bolster the Administration's stance. The source, however, said Bush does not believe that measures to reduce global warming can be put off indefinitely.
Ralph Cicerone, an atmospheric chemist at UC Irvine, said Schlesinger was attempting to "play it straight" by allowing for the fact that future temperature hikes could be smaller than previously believed.
"Schlesinger is a good scientist, and he is fully aware that playing with (climate) models . . . is dangerous," Cicerone said. "I think he felt that in a subject as complicated as climate prediction, we have to use every piece of data available."
Cicerone noted, however, that Schlesinger wrote the report before a more recent study by scientists in Stockholm and Seattle indicated that air pollution from sulfur emissions may have prevented the Northern Hemisphere from warming even more during this century. That study suggests that global warming may be an even greater threat than previously believed because the Earth will warm more as steps to reduce air pollution take effect.
Schlesinger said he is "literally working night and day" on a new study that will take into account the "partially nullifying" effect of sulfates on global warming.
Six of the warmest years since 1850 have occurred during the last decade, with temperatures last year the warmest on record. Some scientists have estimated that temperatures could rise by as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century if nothing is done to curtail greenhouse gases. That would be catastrophic, comparable to the temperature increase since the last Ice Age.
John Firor, director of advanced studies at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., said waiting a decade to reduce emissions would be a major political mistake.
"The sooner we get busy trying to slow down our emissions the better we are," he said. "It is going to take decades to get people organized to reduce emissions. To say we can wait a decade before we start may be a perfectly sound calculation, but it is not a good political calculation."

Abstract: While most of the industrial nations of the world have set firm goals for reducing their production of carbon dioxide, the most prominent of the atmospheric gases that trap the sun's radiation, the Bush Administration has refused to adopt similar targets and insisted upon exhaustive consideration of the economic impact of cutting back carbon dioxide production. The academy panel Wednesday recommended that the United States raise energy prices, taking into account the social and environmental costs of energy production. It also called for energy-efficient building codes, improved efficiency of the nation's automobile fleet through regulation and tax incentives, increased support for mass transit, improved efficiency standards for electrical appliances and studies aimed at measures to slow deforestation of the country. Besides acting as a greenhouse gas, CFCs attack the stratospheric ozone layer that protects the Earth's surface from powerful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Just a week ago, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly said that ozone depletion in the Northern Hemisphere has been proceeding about twice as fast as earlier believed and estimated that the United States might suffer an additional 200,000 skin cancer deaths over the next 50 years as a result.

Full text: Concluding that the threat of global warming is serious enough to warrant prompt national action, a panel of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences said Wednesday that the United States could reduce its production of "greenhouse" pollution as much as 40% with little or no economic cost.
It recommended that the nation pursue a series of steps to provide an insurance policy against expensive mitigation efforts should the more dire predictions of man-made climate change be borne out in the future.
"There are a lot of people in San Francisco who bought insurance two days after the earthquake and wished they had done it earlier," said former Republican Sen. Daniel J. Evans, who presented the results of the two-year study on policy implications of greenhouse warming.
The call for early action reversed a hands-off recommendation made by a similar academy panel eight years ago and called for a far more aggressive posture than the cautious approach adopted by the Bush Administration.
Given current production of carbon dioxide, methane and man-made gases known as chlorofluorocarbons, some projections are that the Earth's average temperature could increase by as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit, with potentially catastrophic results, in the next century.
But while most of the industrial nations of the world have set firm goals for reducing their production of carbon dioxide, the most prominent of the atmospheric gases that trap the sun's radiation, the Bush Administration has refused to adopt similar targets and insisted upon exhaustive consideration of the economic impact of cutting back carbon dioxide production.
The academy panel Wednesday recommended that the United States raise energy prices, taking into account the social and environmental costs of energy production. It also called for energy-efficient building codes, improved efficiency of the nation's automobile fleet through regulation and tax incentives, increased support for mass transit, improved efficiency standards for electrical appliances and studies aimed at measures to slow deforestation of the country.
For the longer term, it called for research aimed at both combatting the warming phenomenon and adapting to whatever happens.
Specifically, it called for improved efficiency of water use through higher prices and supply management and increased agricultural research.
The United States should join international research efforts, it said, in areas such as alteration of clouds, the use of space mirrors to deflect incoming radiation and ways to cause the oceans to increase their absorption of carbon from the atmosphere.
Although the recommendations include proposals for conservation initiatives conspicuously missing from the Administration's national energy strategy, White House science adviser D. Allan Bromley praised the study for "presenting both science and policy options in a very clear and reasonable fashion."
What most pleased the Administration, however, was the panel's recommendation that work be pressed to develop and test a new generation nuclear power reactor.
In spite of that, global warming experts in the environmental community hailed the report as a significant development in the long and bitterly divided debate over climate change policy.
"It breaks new ground by presenting a plethora of measures which can reduce emissions and save money for the taxpayers at the same time," said Michael Oppenheimer, the global warming expert at the Environmental Defense Fund. "It is a new way of looking at the problem. Very significant reductions at a low cost or at net savings is a very significant finding."
Rafe Pomerance, a senior research associate at the World Resources Institute, called the study a door opening for discussion of "global warming tax reform" and energy pricing that includes environmental costs as well as costs such as labor and transportation.
The step deemed most important in early reductions of greenhouse gases is the elimination of the chlorofluorocarbons used in air conditioners and refrigerators and other CFCs used as solvents and for industrial purposes.
More than 50 nations already have committed themselves to phase out CFCs by the year 2000-developing countries have until 2010-and the panel said that research efforts should be stepped up to find nonpolluting substitutes.
Besides acting as a greenhouse gas, CFCs attack the stratospheric ozone layer that protects the Earth's surface from powerful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Just a week ago, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly said that ozone depletion in the Northern Hemisphere has been proceeding about twice as fast as earlier believed and estimated that the United States might suffer an additional 200,000 skin cancer deaths over the next 50 years as a result.
In discussing the academy's global warming report Wednesday, Evans said that it might be advisable to step up the international attack on CFCs.
Already, more than 30 U.S. senators have told Reilly in a letter that in view of the new findings he is required by the 1990 clean air law to impose a more stringent CFC phase-out schedule.
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) has introduced a resolution calling for an emergency meeting of the signatories to the CFC phase-out treaty.
In a telephone interview Wednesday, Bromley said that he considers such an emergency session unnecessary and he questioned the EPA's cancer fatality projections, suggesting that they may be more than 25% too high.
The academy report will be followed later this year by publication of supporting volumes from three other panels.
The conclusions and recommendations reported Wednesday, Evans said, "steered a steady course between those who see no problem and those who believe disaster is upon us. We are prepared for a national debate, which I hope will lead to a policy consensus."

Abstract: Rising seas will ruin hundreds of billions of dollars worth of coastal real estate in the United States in the next 50 years and displace up to 300 million "coastal refugees" worldwide, warns the author of a new study of global warming. The projection, which is not based on the belief among some scientists that melting polar ice sheets will cause still greater sea level rise, means governments at all levels should start making preparations now, said Lynne Edgerton, author of "The Rising Tide." Edgerton, a former lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said a two-foot sea level rise would move the surf several hundred feet up the beaches in south Florida and ruin up to $300 billion worth of coastal real estate.

Full text: Rising seas will ruin hundreds of billions of dollars worth of coastal real estate in the United States in the next 50 years and displace up to 300 million "coastal refugees" worldwide, warns the author of a new study of global warming.
As Earth becomes warmer and expands with the developing `greenhouse effect," the overall volume of the seas will increase enough to cause a rise of slightly more than two feet worldwide by 2050, according to a United Nations panel on climate change.
The projection, which is not based on the belief among some scientists that melting polar ice sheets will cause still greater sea level rise, means governments at all levels should start making preparations now, said Lynne Edgerton, author of "The Rising Tide."
Edgerton, a former lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said a two-foot sea level rise would move the surf several hundred feet up the beaches in south Florida and ruin up to $300 billion worth of coastal real estate.
In addition to destruction of beaches, higher sea levels will increase the damage from coastal storms and, in some low-lying areas, drive millions of people inland, she said.
More than 100 million people live within 50 miles of the U.S. coastline, said Edgerton.
"Ironically, at the same time the sea is rushing at us, we are rushing to the coasts," she said. As an example, she cited Ocean City, Md., which in 1950 had a population of 4,000 and in 1990 had a summer population of 400,000.
She said planners should start taking the likelihood of sea level rise into account now and that Congress should mandate a nationally coordinated response in order to make certain that policy decisions at all levels consider the likely effects.
Among other recommendations:
- The National Flood Insurance Program should factor into its risk calculations future sea level rises and increasingly frequent and severe coastal storms.
- Federal laws should be enacted to require necessary "setbacks" for coastal construction.
- States should require relocation of structures that are vulnerable to erosion and withhold new building permits until applicants present convincing evidence that design and location are appropriate in the event of a two-foot rise.
- Wetland protection laws should be amended to provide enough space for marshes and other wetlands to "migrate" further inland as they are innundated by advancing sea waters.
"It just doesn't make sense to keep building and building in areas vulnerable to a high risk of flooding, erosion and storms," Edgerton said. "New growth should be directed upland of vulnerable areas and people should enjoy low-lying shorelines primarily as . . . ecologically valuable resources."

Abstract: Senate Democrats, eager to tap into voters' anger over the cost and availability of comprehensive health insurance, are pushing their reform bill forward before President Bush can lay out his election-year plan in his State of the Union address. Democrats have put health care at the top of the agenda, mindful of the high public consciousness on the issue that helped Sen. Harris Wofford (D-Pa.) defeat former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh last fall. The Senate Labor Committee was meeting Wednesday to put the final touch on "HealthAmerica" legislation, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and others just a day after the Senate returned from its winter recess.

Full text: Senate Democrats, eager to tap into voters' anger over the cost and availability of comprehensive health insurance, are pushing their reform bill forward before President Bush can lay out his election-year plan in his State of the Union address.
Democrats have put health care at the top of the agenda, mindful of the high public consciousness on the issue that helped Sen. Harris Wofford (D-Pa.) defeat former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh last fall.
The Senate Labor Committee was meeting Wednesday to put the final touch on "HealthAmerica" legislation, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and others just a day after the Senate returned from its winter recess.
Appearing Wednesday on ABC's "Good Morning America," Kennedy criticized the Bush administration for not coming forward with its own program. "We know what they're against," said Kennedy. "We don't know what they're for."
Women who have discovered their silicone breast implants have ruptured or are causing health problems are having a tough time finding plastic surgeons who will remove them.
In some cases, the surgeons won't remove them because health insurance won't pay for it and the women can't afford it. In other cases, surgeons are backing off even when women can pay for it.
"Women are in a dreadful position," said Vivian Snyder, a consumer representative on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's advisory panel on silicone breast implants. "None of the insurance companies, at least the big ones, will cover it."
Alice Wolfson, a San Francisco lawyer, said she has received calls from 30 women so far who want to have their implants removed but can't get their insurers to pay for it.
Women in need of a plastic surgeon to check any problems associated with silicone breast implants may call a toll-free number at the American Society for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons for a referral, at 800-635-0635.
Women are closing one gap between them and men, but there's little that's heartening about it.
In 1979, the average man was 2.5 times as likely as the average woman to have a fatal heart attack. By 1988, that had dropped to 2.1 times as likely.
What happened, according to the American Heart Association, is that while the rate of fatal heart attacks dropped by 38 percent among men, it dropped by 27 percent among women.
Women tend to be older and much sicker than men when they develop heart disease. Even when they get treated, women are less likely to return to lasting good health.
The specific reasons for the disparity still elude scientists.
But research discussed last week at a conference sponsored by the heart association in Galveston, Texas, indicates that mental stress, in combination with low levels of the female hormone estrogen, may be a particularly potent trigger for inducing heart attack and making women more ill, especially older women.
Two greenhouse gases produced as byproducts of aluminum smelting have been found to have global warming potential more than 8,000 times that of carbon dioxide, says Energy Economics and Climate Change, a U.S. business newsletter.
The gases-tetrafluoromethane and hexafluorethane-long have been recognized as byproducts from aluminum smelting but have not attracted attention from researchers because they are nearly inert and have no known toxic properties.
But the newsletter said the gases "greatly amplify the climatic impacts of the aluminum industry" and may double its contribution to the gases responsible for the greenhouse effect. So-called greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun, warming Earth's atmosphere in the long term.
If confirmed by further research, the industry might have to adjust production processes to reduce emissions of the gases, which are produced inadvertently when electric arcing occurs in aluminum smelting.

Abstract: Chaparral blanketing the San Gabriel, Verdugo and San Rafael ranges is the driest since Los Angeles County firefighters began monitoring it in 1979, fire officials said. Beckley and Winery canyons, which come down from the San Gabriel Mountains, and Topanga Canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains are the two most seriously dry brush areas in the county, they said. County Fire Capt. Scott Franklin and Dr. Philip Riggan of the U.S. Forest Service recently toured the upper canyon areas, which provided a smoggy but panoramic view of La Canada Flintridge. Pointing to a map of county areas infested with a mysterious fungus that kills brush, Franklin noted all the hills surrounding the city are particularly susceptible to fire.

Full text: A fire this week in Angeles National Forest renewed concern about the dangerously dry hills above Glendale and La Canada Flintridge, where thousands of acres of dead brush pose the greatest risk of a major blaze in years, experts say.
Chaparral blanketing the San Gabriel, Verdugo and San Rafael ranges is the driest since Los Angeles County firefighters began monitoring it in 1979, fire officials said. Beckley and Winery canyons, which come down from the San Gabriel Mountains, and Topanga Canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains are the two most seriously dry brush areas in the county, they said.
County Fire Capt. Scott Franklin and Dr. Philip Riggan of the U.S. Forest Service recently toured the upper canyon areas, which provided a smoggy but panoramic view of La Canada Flintridge. Pointing to a map of county areas infested with a mysterious fungus that kills brush, Franklin noted all the hills surrounding the city are particularly susceptible to fire.
"I've been here 32 years, and this is the worst it's been," Franklin said. "We've got a serious problem here."
Spokesman Vince Marzo of the Los Angeles Fire Department echoed Franklin's concern. "Dry brush is a continual problem, but this is the worst I've seen in eight or nine years," he said.
25 Acres Burned
The first major fire near La Canada Flintridge this summer burned about 25 acres Monday four miles north in the Angeles forest. A car that plunged more than 300 feet off Angeles Crest Highway exploded and sparked the blaze about 8 a.m. two miles north of an Angeles Crest ranger station. A 12-mile stretch of the highway north of Greenridge Drive was closed until 10 p.m. Monday.
Officer Richard Henry of the California Highway Patrol said no body or footprints were found at the site. Officers were seeking the car's registered owner, Robert S. Hamashige, 55, of Fontana. Hamashige has not been seen since Sunday, a CHP officer said.
As many as 330 firefighters from the county and Pasadena fire departments, the state Department of Forestry and the U. S. Forest Service battled the blaze. No homes or buildings were threatened, and the fire was extinguished by 6 a.m. Tuesday, Forest Service spokesman Robert Brady said. Five firefighters suffered minor injuries, he said.
Favorable Conditions
Greener vegetation and a light wind enabled firefighters to contain flames to the north side of a ridge less than a quarter mile north of Winery Canyon, Franklin said. The hill overlooks La Canada Flintridge to the south.
"If the winds had taken it over the ridge, the fire could have spread down the canyons to Foothill Boulevard in no time," the captain said.
In January, 1984, a fire that swept out of Winery Canyon destroyed 11 homes north of Foothill Boulevard. Flames threatened to jump across the road and consume as many as 500 more, but the the wind and the fire changed direction.
Since that fire, firefighters have planned to burn about 300 acres of dry brush near the top of the canyons to create a natural firebreak that would protect as many as 500 homes below. But unfavorable weather and a temporary lack of liability insurance have held up the controlled burns, and none is planned until spring.
Until then, La Canada Flintridge City Manager Don Otterman said, "We're keeping our fingers crossed. But we're definitely worried about it."
County firefighters have formed smaller firebreaks in lower canyon areas, removing dead brush by hand. Meanwhile, officials are warning residents to clear their property of dry shrubs and to plant fire-resistant vegetation.
Fires spread more quickly and burn hotter when fueled by extremely dry brush, experts said. They measure the moisture in brush samples by weighing them, drying them and then weighing them again.
Ceanothus, also called mountain lilac, normally has enough moisture to weigh twice what it would when dried out; in other words, its moisture is equal to 100% of its dry weight. The shrub, one of the most common types of mountain chaparral, is considered critically dry when its moisture content is 60%.
Moisture levels in ceanothus covering the hills above La Canada Flintridge are down to 50%, the lowest recorded since measurements began in 1979, Riggan said.
The severely dry vegetation results from a combination of natural and urban factors, forestry and fire officials said.
Although temperatures generally are lower than usual this year, so is rainfall. Normal annual precipitation is 14.85 inches, and Los Angeles County has received only 3.68 inches so far this year, according to the National Weather Service. Although 18 inches fell last year, 1984 and 1985 each brought slightly less than nine inches.
The dry period that began in 1984 followed six years of near- or above-average rainfall, during which the chaparral grew tall and abundant. The dramatic climate change has weakened the brush, experts said.
Less Resistant to Smog
Pollutants also affect the vegetation. Nitrates deposited in the soil from air pollution act as fertilizers during the wet years, fostering abundant plant growth. But, during drought, the weakened vegetation is less resistant to smog, which promotes drying.
A mysterious disease called dieback also has played a major role in turning the once verdant ground cover in the hills above La Canada Flintridge into a grayish-brown shroud of dead brush. The condition, believed to be caused by a fungus, attacks the leaves of the ceanothus, sumac and manzanita.
The Forest Service is investigating the cause of the disease, which has infested more than 500,000 acres of brush in Southern California, Riggan said.
Meanwhile, county firefighters are bracing for autumn, the height of the fire season in the San Gabriel foothills. From September to October, hot Santa Ana winds rush through the combustible chaparral, whipping down the canyons and into La Canada Flintridge.
"We're doing everything we can," Franklin said. "But there's a lot of dry fuel here, and a fire through here could set it off like a bomb."

Full text: Â  The greenhouse effect simmered its way into the public consciousness last summer during weeks of pounding heat and drought. Now, Americans tell pollsters that they worry about the greenhouse effect and support greater energy efficiency.
Out on the highways, however, we are putting the pedal to the floor and rocketing off in the opposite direction.
Performance is the watchword in the auto showroom these days, not fuel efficiency. Horsepower is going up, engines are getting bigger, and the high-powered muscle car is making a comeback. "We build excitement," crows a Pontiac commercial.
And to the dismay of energy specialists, more and more Americans are replacing their cars with less efficient vehicles in the light truck category, which includes pickups, vans and jeeps. In 1987, sales in this category were almost a third as large as car sales.
Although energy analysts say that improving efficiency is the first immediate step the world can take to combat global warming, this year in the United States "fuel consumption is soaring," said Marc R. Ledbetter, an energy specialist with the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
"Gasoline is cheaper than it has been in a very long time. The real price is less than in 1973," he noted. At the same time, he added, the federal government has been relaxing automobile fuel economy standards.
Increasing fuel consumption gives a boost to the greenhouse effect, because burning more gasoline releases more carbon dioxide, one of the principal "greenhouse gases." These gases are building up in the Earth's atmosphere and trapping the sun's heat -- the greenhouse effect -- leading many scientists to believe that a rapid and disruptive climate change may already be under way.
"The trends to increased horsepower and performance are alarming when you look at the environmental consequences," said Michael Bradley, who heads a group of regional air pollution control officials called the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management.
If fuel efficiency decreases in motor vehicles, he said, it will not only be more difficult to stem the greenhouse effect, but also more difficult to solve the region's air pollution problems. Last summer set records for ozone smog levels across the Northeast, he noted: "We're going in the wrong direction."
If we want to stop the greenhouse effect from worsening, scientists estimate that we will have to cut our use of gasoline and other fossil fuels by at least half and probably more.
In 1988, fuel consumption nationally has gone up 7 percent, an increase that means an additional 110 million tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, according to William Chandler, an energy specialist with Battelle-Pacific Northwest Laboratories. One-fifth of the increase in carbon dioxide is due to cars and light trucks, he said.
Ledbetter said fuel consumption is increasing for several reasons.
In his view, the light truck fad is "one of the biggest and most important trends" that are "causing fuel consumption to rise faster."
About 75 percent of these pickups, jeeps and vans are being used like cars for driving to work or the shopping mall, not for farm, commercial or freight-carrying purposes, according to Marc Ross, an energy efficiency analyst at the University of Michigan.
On average, they get about 21 miles per gallon, while a new car gets 28, he noted. In his analysis, their growing popularity is the main reason the growth in fuel efficiency has slowed since 1981.
At the same time, new car fuel efficiency is not getting better, largely, Ledbetter said, because "the federal government hasn't done anything to promote fuel economy."
The Reagan administration, he noted, has been giving auto companies exemptions from the congressionally mandated 27.5-m.p.g. fuel economy standard since 1985. This fall, the administration rolled back the requirement for the 1989 model year by one mile a gallon, to 26.5. A similar rollback for 1990 cars is expected soon.
Ledbetter and other energy specialists note that several auto companies have prototypes that get 75 and even 100 m.p.g.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, a Washington-based environmental group, is challenging the latest federal rollback in fuel-efficiency standards. Robert Watson, a scientist with the group, said that the country will emit 18 million extra tons of carbon dioxide as a result of that action.
Added to all this, Ledbetter said, is that Americans are driving more. The number of miles traveled by US drivers has been climbing about 3 percent a year over the past two decades, according to Ross.
Auto efficiency specialist K.G. Duleep of Energy and Environmental Analysis, a Washington consulting company, sees increasing horsepower and performance as "the major trend in fuel economy reduction," noting that "the bigger the engine the lower the fuel efficiency." He considers the light truck fad less important.
As a general rule, Duleep said, a 10 percent increase in horsepower means a 3 percent reduction in fuel economy, all other things being equal. In the past five years, auto manufacturers have boosted horsepower by 30 percent to 50 percent.
The evolution of the Honda Accord from an 80- to a 120-horsepower car since 1981 is typical, Duleep said, noting that "all of the Japanese cars have increased horsepower tremendously."
Although the return of the muscle car has received a lot of publicity, Duleep stressed that the upward trend in horsepower is evident throughout the auto industry, not just in the high-performance cars that will do 130 miles per hour, but also in compact cars and light trucks.
Why is the American car market roaring off in the wrong direction?
Fred Bowdith, vice president for technical affairs for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, blames consumers for the trends.
"That's what we're finding is selling automobiles," he said in a telephone interview. The association is a trade group representing six US auto companies, as well as Honda and Volvo, that have plants in the United States.
"There are cars on the market that get 40 to 50 miles per gallon," Bowditch said, but "we're having a very difficult time selling them." People are buying "those with a little bit better performance."
Consumer demand is not the whole story, in Duleep's view. He said auto companies are fostering the trend by using performance to differentiate their new cars from the competition.
"There's a real horsepower war going on right now," he said. "It seems to be a pretty major selling point. When some companies raise the horsepower, the others are forced to follow."
He noted that a 380-horsepower Corvette is about to make its debut and that some companies have 400-horsepower models on the drawing boards.
In recent years, Ross said, new technologies have been incorporated into automobiles that could be used either to improve fuel efficiency or to better performance. "The choice is being made largely to improve performance," he said.
In the next two decades, Ross predicted, the amount of driving done by Americans is likely to increase by 50 percent. "I'm trying to find out why this is increasing as fast as it is," Ross said. One reason, he speculated, may be that people are traveling more because more part-time work is available and more people are in the work force.
Nevertheless, he calculates that we could reduce fuel use by one-third during this period by requiring that cars get 45 to 50 miles per gallon and that light trucks get at least 35. Such a change, he said, does not require economic dislocation or unusual technology.
In the meantime, however, the horsepower war is continuing, though Duleep said that higher insurance rates on high-performance cars could eventually put the brakes on this trend.
"At some point this becomes insane," he observed, not just because of the greenhouse effect, but because most of the time these high-powered cars are "just sitting in traffic."

Full text: Â  A major study by the National Academy of Sciences challenged Bush administration policy on global warming yesterday and urged the United States to act now to cut "greenhouse gas" emissions, saying major reductions are possible at little or no cost.
The report by the academy panel concluded that the nation could reduce as much as 40 percent of its 1990 emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases using existing technologies.
"In other words," the panel said, "insurance is cheap" against global warming.
The study, requested by Congress in 1988, represents a major departure from the last major academy report on the greenhouse problem, the buildup of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases produced by burning fossil fuels, agriculture and other human activities. That study, published in 1983, did not endorse actions to reduce use of fossil fuels, recommending more study instead.
The new report also recommends that the United States support worldwide population control efforts to reduce use of fossil fuels and called for increased research and development of alternative energy sources and on a new generation of nuclear plants.
The study was prepared by four panels that included nearly 50 leading scientists, economists, political scientists, industry representatives, and environment and energy specialists.
"The fact that we were able to come up with this much consensus is impressive," said Stephen Schneider, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, who sat on the main panel that distilled the huge effort into a final report. "Especially," he added, "considering that this was a very broad-based group that included all the interests."
The Bush administration has resisted aggressive action to reduce greenhouse gases and make efforts to combat greenhouse warming a key element in its energy policy, apparently in the belief that the science is too uncertain and the costs too high.
"As I see it, there is quite a divergence of view" between the Bush administration policy and the report," said Jessica Tuchman Mathews of the World Resources Institute, another member of the synthesis panel. "Like 180 degrees."
"As I understand the administration position," she said, "it is that we should work to get rid" of chlorofluorocarbons, "but the uncertainty of greenhouse science is so great as not to warrant making it a central issue in energy policy."
The United States has signed an international treaty committing it to phase out chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, because they are responsible for depleting the Earth's protective ozone layer, but the same gases also trap heat and contribute to the threat of global warming.
While Tuchman and other members saw a marked divergence between the study and administration policy, White House officials chose to highlight the areas where there is some agreement between the report's recommendations and administration actions.
"I am pleased most of the recommendations are in concert with steps the administration has under way or will soon launch," said Michael Deland, the chairman of the President's Council on Environmental Quality. He called the report "a strong endorsement" of such administration efforts as a major tree planting program. The report recommended a modest tree planting program, because trees absorb and store carbon dioxide.
Deland noted that the report does not advocate targets and timetables for reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which the European Community has advocated at international negotiations on a climate treaty. "We have avoided this for good reason," Deland said.
A news release by the Department of Energy made a similar argument. The department said it is actively pursuing research in a new generation of nuclear plants, as the report advocates.
Deland and other officials argue that actions the administration is taking will maintain US greenhouse gas emissions at or below current levels until the year 2030. If the threat of global warming is real, however, atmospheric scientists estimate that it could take reductions of 50 percent or more to prevent rapid climate change.
Deland dismissed those who saw great differences between administration policy and the academy report, saying they were doing so for political reasons.
"Because it is a serious and well researched report done by a very thoughtful group," Deland added, "it will receive very close attention. Those actions that fall within the cost-effective category will be scrutinized with particular care."
The report recommended actions in energy and transportation that conflict with current policy or go far beyond what the administration has been willing to support.
These recommendations included:
- Making greenhouse warming "a key factor in planning our future energy mix."
- Improving automobile efficiency through appropriate regulation and tax incentives.
- Sharply increasing the emphasis on efficiency and conservation in the federal research and development budget.
The report also took a strong stand on the need for US leadership in international population control efforts, citing population growth as a major factor in the growth of greenhouse gases. The Bush administration had refused to support UN population programs on the grounds that these funds go to programs that include abortion services.
Schneider said the administration does not support a whole variety of measures recommended in the reports, including national building codes, taxes on fuels and major investments in research on renewable sources of energy.
"One of the most important recommendations in the report," Schneider said, "is that energy prices must reflect the cost of the risk of environmental change. How can you do that except through a fee or a cost?" If the administration says they support this report, "how are they going to do it?" Schneider asked.
"I think this hits the administration's policy head on and shows it to be ridiculous," said Douglas Foy of the Boston-based Conservation Law Foundation, who served on a subcommittee of the larger study. "It's fairly clear testimony to the bankruptcy of the national energy policy."
Foy said pioneering work in energy efficiency in New England has helped make the case that "there are vast opportunities to deal with greenhouse warming that are very cheap and will in fact save you money."
In its scientific assessment, the panel tended to echo previous reports, but it placed more emphasis on the possibility of dramatic surprises from greenhouse warming.
It concluded that current interpretations of the temperature records show a warming in the global average temperature of 0.5 degrees to 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century. While this warming is "roughly consistent" with the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the panel found it impossible to prove it to be a result of greenhouse gases.

Audubon Does Not Embrace Nuclear Power: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: It is in this sense only-as a sort of global-warming insurance policy in case the transition to renewable energy systems fails to materialize-that I recommended that some small amount of funding be made available for continued basic research directed toward the development of advanced, inherently safe nuclear reactors. Even here, I was careful to point out that the "allocation of research funds among the various technologies should reflect the low probability that any kind of nuclear option will prove both commercially viable and sufficiently idiot-proof to overcome public concern about the safety of the nuclear fuel cycle." The real question for The Post to ponder is not whether the environmental movement is willing to "rethink the role of nuclear power" but whether the nuclear industry is willing to face reality. JAN BEYEA Senior Staff Scientist, National Audubon Society New York

Full text: Without themost careful reading, the article "Nuclear Power Debate Shifts" {front page, Aug. 24} was bound to leave readers with the impression that, faced with the threat of global climate change, we at the National Audubon Society have "rethought our position on nuclear power" and are now ready to embrace a technology whose inherent problems we have spent many years in exposing.
Nothing could be further from the truth. We feel compelled to point out that many of the conclusions in the article, which are tacitly associated with Audubon, are actually drawn from quotes from non-Audubon sources.
In my testimony to the House energy subcommittee, which I provided to The Post's reporter, I made it clear that "current nuclear technology cannot make a significant contribution to staving off climate disruption." I also made clear our conclusion that "the most practical program for solving the greenhouse problem in the next century involves ... {on the demand side} improved energy efficiency and materials recycling, {and on the supply side} emphasis on direct solar technologies, such as photovoltaics."
Finally, I stated that despite the high promise of direct solar power, enough uncertainty still remains about our ability to rely totally on renewable energy as a future resource that some level of continued long-term research into future applications of other technologies is warranted.
It is in this sense only-as a sort of global-warming insurance policy in case the transition to renewable energy systems fails to materialize-that I recommended that some small amount of funding be made available for continued basic research directed toward the development of advanced, inherently safe nuclear reactors. Even here, I was careful to point out that the "allocation of research funds among the various technologies should reflect the low probability that any kind of nuclear option will prove both commercially viable and sufficiently idiot-proof to overcome public concern about the safety of the nuclear fuel cycle."
For this reason, Audubon joined other conservation groups in urging Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.) to remove the authorization for a full-scale advanced demonstration reactor that was contained in his first comprehensive global-warming bill. For the record, I should note that Sen. Wirth did remove the authorization in the current version of the bill.
To make Audubon's position clear: the present nuclear industry has no future, even in a greenhouse world, because it is too expensive to represent a real investment option to back out carbon dioxide, and because it has failed to solve the most fundamental reactor safety and quality-assurance problems or to find a means for the safe disposal of nuclear waste.
The nuclear industry has yet to show any real interest in moving to a technology capable of addressing these problems and has in fact been highly critical of efforts, like my own, to move the federal nuclear research effort away from tinkering with the current generation of light-water reactors and toward a potentially more productive future-oriented effort.
The real question for The Post to ponder is not whether the environmental movement is willing to "rethink the role of nuclear power" but whether the nuclear industry is willing to face reality. JAN BEYEA Senior Staff Scientist, National Audubon Society New York

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FISCAL 1991 BUDGET: [FINAL EDITION]

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/highlights-fiscal-1991-budget/docview/307222184/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: The biggest single increase in the overall $20.8 billion international affairs budget is an additional $700 million to provide $1.4 billion for paying full assessments for the first time to all 51 international organizations in which the United States participates-from the United Nations to the World Health Organization-and includes a five-year payment plan to cover U.S. arrearages to all international organizations and peacekeeping operations. Sources said the large increase reflected [Bush]'s personal commitment to meet U.S. obligations to the United Nations and similar organizations. The department's budget this year is undramatic, but reflects the stated priorities of Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole in several areas. The budget adds $252.6 million to aid disadvantaged youth under the JTPA program, with much of the money picked up from the $230.5 million counted as saved from the administration's proposed repeal of the training provision of the trade act. The Bush administration favors providing training assistance through the program for Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance, which is not tied solely to trade.

Full text: Agriculture
With a new farm bill in the works, the Agriculture Department budget for fiscal 1991 is less than a certainty. Depending on how things work out, the spending proposal sent to Congress yesterday could go up anywhere from one to 4 percent.
The White House has proposed a $500 million increase in budget outlays, raising spending from $48.2 billion to $48.7 billion. But President Bush has called for $1.5 billion in unspecified cuts in price supports in the new farm bill. If Congress were to go along with the president's proposal, outlays could be held to $48.7 billion. Under existing programs, however, spending could be forced up over $50 billion.
The budget seeks repeal of the Federal Crop Insurance Corp. in favor of a new disaster assistance program.
Food stamps and other nutrition programs account for nearly half the agriculture budget at $23.4 billion. The food stamp program is slated to increase $600 million to $15.4 billion, but the child nutrition program is proposed to be cut by $156 million to $5.2 billion. Spending for the WIC program (women, infants and children) would be increased slightly to $2.21 billion.
Commodity price supports account for $10.2 billion, assuming that Congress will support the $1.5 billion cut in support payments requested by the White House.
The administration is proposing a major cut in the Farmers Home Administration, from $7.1 billion to $5.8 billion, as the government shifts from direct loans to loan guarantees.
Commerce
The Commerce Department is requesting $2.5 billion in 1991, a $1 billion decline that largely reflects the completion of the census.
But Commerce officials are expected to run into strong congressional opposition for $336 million in other cuts that the department would use to increase funding for other programs. These cuts come in areas popular with lawmakers, including $214 million in economic development assistance designed to help distressed areas. Prior attempts to erase this program have failed.
The department is requesting an additional $6.4 million to help minority businesses, which Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher has called one of his top priorities. It also is seeking $10 million more to expand the number of U.S. commercial attaches in key export markets, including adding an office in Brussels to monitor unification of the European Community and Eastern Europe.
The department will add $7 million to improve its reporting of economic data and $2.8 million to handle an increasing number of unfair-trade complaints brought by U.S. industries.
Drugs and Justice
The overall program to combat drugs totals $10.6 billion, a $1.1 billion increase over spending authority for 1990. Of that, $7.6 billion is targeted for law enforcement, $1.7 billion for drug treatment and $1.4 billion for drug prevention and education.
The Justice Department's budget, fueled once again by increased resources for combating drugs, is to grow by 19 percent to almost $9 billion, excluding costs of prison construction, a multiyear program provided for in the 1990 budget. There are funds for 234 additional assistant U.S. attorneys, including 151 drug prosecutors.
The budget provides $700 million-a 28 percent increase-for the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation's budget grows $141 million to $1.64 billion, but for the first time since 1981, the number of agents would decline next year, by 404 to 9,397.
FBI agents investigating drug cases would increase by 102. The trims would be felt in areas such as white-collar and organized crime.
FBI Deputy Director Floyd I. Clarke said the cuts are necessary because of a new law raising overtime pay for law enforcement agents.
Late yesterday, Justice Department spokesman David R. Runkel told reporters that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had not yet approved the reductions in the number of agents and that the figures represent only "the bureau's proposal for dealing with this."
Runkel said the attorney general "doesn't necessarily agree" and that "his concerns are to make sure that the overtime issue is handled in such a way that no agents are taken away from the fight on drugs, white-collar crime or organized crime."
FBI spokesman Chuck Steinmetz said Justice had "approved" the plan. "I don't understand that at all," he said of Runkel's comments.
Education
The Education Department is slated for a $500 million increase in budget authority to $24.6 billion, a 2 percent rise. The spending plan marks the second time that Bush, who has billed himself the "education president," has proposed that the department's budget not keep pace with inflation.
His 1991 request also follows a pattern President Ronald Reagan established, effectively shifting funds from college student aid to elementary and secondary programs, particularly for the disadvantaged or handicapped. Overall, elementary and secondary programs would increase about 9 percent, while college student aid programs would decline about 5 percent.
Funding for Chapter 1 remedial programs for low-income students would rise by $366 million, or 8 percent, to almost $5 billion. Other increases sought in elementary or secondary programs include $100 million for "merit schools," $94 million for mathematics and science education and $82 million for the handicapped.
Funding for the Guaranteed Student Loan program, the government's largest college aid program, would drop by $648 million to $3.1 billion-primarily because of optimistic assumptions about declining interest rates that allow the administration to reduce the amount it projects it will have to subsidize rates charged on the student loans. About 9,000 fewer students would receive the loans, but their total value would rise by $54 million. About 4.1 million students are expected to take out guaranteed student loans.
Pell Grants for college students would increase by $473 million, to $5.3 billion, but most of the additional funds would make up shortfalls this year and last. The program is funded in advance, and the increase applies to the 1991-92 school year.
Environment
Overall spending for environmental programs would increase by $2 billion, with most of it earmarked for cleanup of federal weapon facilities, protection of the nation's dwindling wetlands and research into global warming.
The budget proposes several new programs, including $175 million to plant 1 billion new trees to help restore wildlife habitat and help absorb gases that cause global warming.
But overall funding for the nation's principal environmental regulator, the Environmental Protection Agency, would increase less than one percent while the Interior Department budget is slated to drop 6 percent.
Interior and the EPA each recommended reduced spending in programs popular with Congress, setting up a likely confrontation with lawmakers. For example, the $1.6 billion that EPA proposed for construction of sewage treatment plants is $800 million less than Congress authorized for fiscal 1990.
The largest increases would go for cleanup of radioactive and other toxic wastes at military and Energy Department weapon facilities. Spending would increase 20 percent to $4.48 billion.
Another $200 million would be spent to accelerate cleanup at Superfund toxic waste sites, boosting the budget to $1.74 billion.
More than $1 billion would be earmarked for research into global environment problems, such as depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer and global warming.
The Bush blueprint includes a proposal that addresses the below-market sale of timber at nine of 120 national forests. Environmentalists say such sales encourage indiscriminate logging.
Interior's $7.7 billion spending plan includes $114 million in new money to help correct what Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. has described as a $2 billion backlog in maintenance and rehabilitation needs at national parks, wildlife refuges and other public lands.
Foreign Aid
The administration is requesting $15 billion for foreign aid for fiscal 1991, an increase of about $1 billion over the previous year-looking for $300 million in new aid for Eastern Europe, a new $441 million anti-drug package for Latin America and $270 million for international development banks.
The biggest recipients of U.S. foreign aid, Israel and Egypt, would continue to receive $3 billion and $2.1 billion respectively in combined military and economic aid.
The administration wants the $300 million set aside for aid to "support democracy and economic restructuring in Eastern Europe," according to the budget, promising that specific legislation "will be proposed."
The biggest single increase in the overall $20.8 billion international affairs budget is an additional $700 million to provide $1.4 billion for paying full assessments for the first time to all 51 international organizations in which the United States participates-from the United Nations to the World Health Organization-and includes a five-year payment plan to cover U.S. arrearages to all international organizations and peacekeeping operations.
Sources said the large increase reflected Bush's personal commitment to meet U.S. obligations to the United Nations and similar organizations.
Another big-ticket item is $270 million to replace the bug-riddled U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
Housing and Urban Development
Officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which underwent deep budget cuts during the Reagan administration, hailed its $23.7 billion budget-a $5.3 billion increase over the current level-as proof that the department has regained respectability in the Bush administration.
"That 29 percent increase is good news," said HUD Undersecretary Alfred A. DelliBovi. But some interest groups charged that the news was not good and that the largest increases for some ongoing programs indicated that other programs had been cut.
"It's a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul," said Richard Nelson, executive director of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. "Through smoke and mirrors, they're trying to indicate that they are giving more assistance, and they're not."
For example, Nelson said, HUD eliminated its $5 million "congregate housing program," which funded group living arrangements among the elderly.
The HUD budget attempts to address some areas in which the department has been sharply criticized. It boosts funding for homelessness programs by 66 percent to $150 million and adds $33.5 million to help HUD better manage 77 computer financial systems that now cannot communicate with one another.
As expected, the budget includes $1.2 billion to help finance the president's HOPE (Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere) program, to provide grants and matching funds for housing initiatives.
The administration is proposing to require local housing authorities to develop detailed plans for helping low-income families climb "the ladder of opportunity" out of poverty. Agencies that lack such plans will be denied HUD funds under the proposal.
Labor
The Bush administration is proposing a $1.3 billion increase in Labor Department spending, with no major item dominating the added outlays. Much of the department's spending is mandated by law for such programs as the $4.2 billion Jobs Training Partnership Act and unemployment insurance.
The department's authority to commit spending in fiscal 1991 and beyond dropped from $32.5 billion to $32.1 billion, largely reflecting an end to the temporary federal tax surcharge for the Unemployment Trust Fund at the end of 1990.
The department's budget this year is undramatic, but reflects the stated priorities of Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole in several areas. The budget adds $252.6 million to aid disadvantaged youth under the JTPA program, with much of the money picked up from the $230.5 million counted as saved from the administration's proposed repeal of the training provision of the trade act. The Bush administration favors providing training assistance through the program for Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance, which is not tied solely to trade.
In the enforcement area, another major concern of Dole's, the department is asking for a 50 percent increase in the number of inspectors for pension fund enforcement, to 300. Dole said yesterday the number of inspectors has increased little in the 15 years since the federal pension law was enacted. The department is responsible for regulating more than 900,000 pension plans.
The department also asked for another 22 inspectors for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, for a total of 1,312.
Office of Personnel Management
The Office of Personnel Management said a 3.5 percent pay raise is contemplated for all federal employees, breaking with the practice in some Reagan administration budgets of proposing higher rates for the military than for civilians. If Congress and the administration agree, the raise would take effect next January.
The budget offers a preview of a new federal pay revision plan the administration expects to send to Congress next month. Workers in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco would be paid "geographical differentials" of as much as 8 percent. Entry-level salaries for college graduates entering certain federal jobs would be raised 5 percent. Details of the pay plan remain to be announced.
Once again, the budget proposes eliminating the right of federal workers to withdraw any personal contributions to their pensions in a "lump sum" at the time of retirement. This proposal has failed to pass Congress several times.
OPM proposed a one-year freeze in cost-of-living adjustments for federal retirees in 1991, except for those who are permanently disabled, saying that even with the freeze, federal retirement benefits would remain ahead of most private pension programs.
After 1991, a less generous formula for calculating cost-of-living adjustments for retirees is proposed. It is aimed at keeping such adjustments one percentage point below the increase in the cost of living.
Science and Health
Major civilian science and technology agencies, and especially high-visibility projects such as the study of the human genome and climate change, would enjoy sizable increases in Bush's budget.
The budget proposes an increase of 12 percent, to $26.7 billion, for civilian research and development, and a 4 percent increase, to $41.4 billion, for defense R&D. Basic research would increase 8 percent to $11 billion.
Funding for the Superconducting Super Collider would grow more slowly than its backers had wanted, reaching $317 million for the year. But the project, intended to explore the building blocks of matter, apparently has won renewed backing from Energy Secretary James D. Watkins despite disclosures of expected multibillion-dollar cost overruns.
The budget of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, begun last year to coordinate studies of climate change, would increase 57 percent to more than $1 billion. Much of the increase would be for Earth-observing satellites. Several agencies, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are slated for proposed increases of 200 to 300 percent for global change research. Overall, the budget for NOAA would increase 35 percent to $1.3 billion.
Spending on the Humane Genome Project, designed to read the entire genetic code that defines a human being, would rise 56 percent to $156 million. The Health and Human Services budget proposes a $300 million increase, to $7.1 billion, for non-AIDS biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health, and $1.7 billion for AIDS research, an increase of about $110 million.
The National Science Foundation budget, which funds non-medical, non-military research at universities and colleges, would increase 14 percent to $2.4 billion.
Social Services
President Bush proposes a 6 percent increase in spending by the Department of Health and Human Services.
Nearly all HHS spending, 94 percent, is concentrated in large income-support and medical service programs. These include Social Security ($262.4 billion), Medicare ($107.8 billion), Medicaid ($44.9 billion), Supplemental Security Income for the low-income aged, blind and disabled ($13.2 billion) and Aid to Families with Dependent Children ($12.6 billion). A 3.9 percent increase in Social Security benefits is projected for January 1991.
HHS seeks to add about $4 billion in Medicare and Social Security tax revenue by adding to those programs millions of state and local government employees.
It also wants to raise $600 million by charging drug companies for processing new product applications and hospitals and nursing homes for inspections.
The budget seeks to increase from $1.39 billion to $1.89 billion the budget authority for Head Start, the pre-school education program for low-income children. It seeks a $552 million increase, to $1.927 billion, for foster care and adoption funds. It would authorize a near tripling, to $1 billion, for the new job training program for welfare mothers.
The administration wants to reduce by $5.5 billion what Medicare otherwise would pay doctors and hospitals if spending continued at current levels after accounting for population increases and inflation. The targeted cuts include payments for training interns and residents, reimbursements for hospital capital expenditures and outpatient services, inpatient services at hospitals and doctor fee schedules for primary services.
Fuel-aid payments to the poor would be cut from $1.39 billion in 1990 to $1.05 billion.
Space
The administration has requested $15.1 billion for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, a $2.8 billion increase. Last year, Congress cut almost $1 billion from the $13.3 billion budget request.
Part of the new money would go to two initiatives: $264 million to the first element of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, known as the Earth Observing System (EOS); and $188 million to the president's initiative to send people back to the moon and on to Mars.
The EOS funds are for two instrument-packed space platforms to be launched into orbit and, on the ground, a "massive" data analysis system. The project is designed to study how Earth's land, oceans, ice and atmosphere interact, and to provide a basis for policy decisions, such as on the use of fossil fuels, in the next century.
The goals of the program are popular on Capitol Hill but its price tag of $17 billion over the next decade is said to have caused "sticker shock."
New funds earmarked for the lunar/Mars initiative would go toward innovative technology and scientific research, including a lunar robot mission. Officials said that, counting existing programs and missions being applied to the initiative, which was announced last July, its total 1991 budget would come to $1 billion.
The budget also calls for $2.6 billion for the planned international space station, soon to begin fabrication, and $119 million for NASA's share of research on the NASA/Defense Department National Aero-Space Plane (NASP), an air-breathing craft that would take off horizontally, fly to orbit and land like a plane.
Transportation
The $26.9 billion Transportation Department budget proposal is weighted heavily toward improvements in the air traffic control system. The Federal Aviation Administration budget would grow by 16 percent to $8.3 billion.
The greatest rise within the FAA budget would be a 45 percent increase for facilities and equipment, mainly for the National Airspace System, aimed at modernizing air traffic control. The budget also envisions hiring additional air traffic controllers.
There would be increases in the budgets of the Coast Guard, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Maritime Administration, reflecting an emphasis on safety, drug enforcement and research and development.
The budget also strongly reflects Secretary Samuel K. Skinner's philosophy that users should pay for what they use. Almost 80 percent of the budget would be financed through user fees, by an increase in the airline ticket tax from 8 percent to 10 percent and other air fuel and cargo fees, and by new or increased fees involving the Coast Guard, railroad safety and commercial space transportation.
In percentage terms, by far the largest increase in the budget is a 400 percent rise for research on magnetic levitation transportation. Although the amount remains relatively small at $9.7 million, it reflects Skinner's strong support of research and development.
Amtrak again would receive no federal funding-but Congress, again, is expected to provide funds to the national passenger railroad. The user fee proposals also face a rough road in Congress.
Veterans Affairs
The Department of Veterans Affairs won a $1 billion increase for its 172 hospitals, enough to win the plaudits of groups that supported formation of the new department, but not enough to stop Secretary Edward J. Derwinski from seeking a detailed review of the hospitals' future.
Derwinski announced that he is forming a national commission to examine the issue despite congressional opposition and hopes to have its findings by next year. Rep. G.V. "Sonny" Montgomery (D-Miss.), chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, rejected the idea last year when the secretary sought legislative endorsement of it.
The $30.9 billion VA budget would allow the department to add 2,300 people to its hospitals, ending what some officials said was an eight-year cycle of tight budgets for the federal goverment's largest medical system. Derwinski said he hopes the budget, which will provide $12.3 billion for the hospitals, will "get grudging acceptance" from veterans groups. "I don't expect to meet all their expectations, except maybe in Utopia," he said.
The veterans groups are expected to turn much of their opposition to a budget proposal that would require a 4 percent down payment on any home valued at more than $25,000 that a veteran wishes to purchase through the VA's popular home loan program. Veterans currently are not required to make a down payment for a VA home loan, a factor that officials said may have led to record program defaults in recent years.

Explorer in the Jungles of Power; The Smithsonian's Tom Lovejoy, ENvironmental Liaison to the Stars: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: These days Lovejoy's base of operations is his office in the Smithsonian Castle-orchids from the horticulture department are delivered there weekly as one of his perks-and fax machines wherever he is. Close at hand are his three key facilitators: Carmen Thorndike, his gatekeeper, Marc Pachter, his principal deputy, and Tom McCance, a deputy assistant secretary responsible for membership and development. Lovejoy admits that that the daily influx is daunting, and that he is learning about pacing himself. "I can't push it as much in my terminal forties as I could in my terminal thirties," he says. Technically, working the corridors of power is not in Lovejoy's job description. But there are times when it has certainly helped. Last December, for example, after a group of scientists from the Smithsonian's tropical research station in Panama was taken hostage during the American invasion, Lovejoy was called to the situation room from his office Christmas party. He made two phone calls. Within 20 minutes, a representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was on the phone, and by the next day, the hostages were rescued.

Full text: A sampling from Tom Lovejoy's spring calendar:
Senate appropriation hearings for the Smithsonian. The Academy Awards. Meetings of President Bush's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. Earth Day on the Mall with Tom Cruise and John Ritter. A meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Science in Rome. Board meetings of the New York Botanical Gardens, the Hirshhorn Museum, the Manhattan Life Insurance Co. Paris to see President Francois Mitterrand and Jacques Cousteau. The Canadian Parliament.
"He is really hard to get hold of," says actor Robert Redford, Lovejoy's pal. "The first time I actually spoke to him, I finally tracked him down in Florida between planes."
For a tropical biologist, Tom Lovejoy gets around.
For years he was primarily known as an expert on the ecosystems of the Brazilian rain forests, an executive of the World Wildlife Fund, and the co-founder of the public television series "Nature."
Then two very different things happened: First, in November 1987 Lovejoy signed on at the Smithsonian Institution as its assistant secretary for external affairs.
Then Hollywood discovered the environment.
"Tom Lovejoy has saved more species over dinner than most scientific papers ever published," says Mark Plotkin of Conservation International.
Thomas E. Lovejoy, 48, is a dapper, Yale-educated environmentalist who quickly became the Smithsonian's public persona, bridging the gap between the institution and its benefactors, its watchdogs in Congress, its allies and potential allies.
"Even an institution as big as this one can't be an island unto itself," he says.
The responsibilities of his $90,000-a-year job include fund-raising, membership, international relations, congressional relations, special events and internal media. It was a job that Smithsonian Secretary Robert McCormick Adams had been trying to fill for a couple of years.
"Tom brought not only just the right kinds of skills to do the job," says Dean Anderson, the undersecretary of the Smithsonian, "but he came complete with the credentials of a highly respected scientist."
And it didn't hurt that Lovejoy was credited with two innovative conservation biology projects-the Minimum Critical Size of Ecosystems project in Brazil and the concept of international "debt-for-nature swaps." Neither did the connections that came with his tony upbringing (his grandfather and father were CEOs of the Manhattan Life Insurance Co.). Finally there was the open, good-humored manner that allowed him to get along with the variety of Homo sapiens found around Washington and in the international scientific community.
The Smithsonian, with its more than 600 research scholars, 13 museums and the zoo, and its mandate for "the increase and diffusion of knowledge," was beginning to feel the pinch of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings act. The institution's fund-raiser had retired, and secretary Adams had not shown much inclination to step into the breach.
"When Bob Adams replaced Dillon Ripley as secretary, we got a very different personality in the position," observes Robert Hoffmann, the Smithsonian's assistant secretary for research. "Dillon was his own superb external affairs person. Bob has great strengths, but they are not precisely the kinds of things that Dillon was able to do so well because he was able to give them his personal attention: the operations of the office of membership and development. The new secretary felt that he would rather have his own person doing those on his behalf so that he could focus on other things."
"When I go into foundations, banks or go to the Hill, I personify what the Smithsonian is all about because I am a scientist," says Lovejoy. "I am not just asking on behalf of others."
Indeed, Lovejoy, a trim, athletic man who wears jeans in his off hours, admits that he is probably happiest in the Brazilian rain forest. He lived there with his family from 1967 to '69 while he worked on his PhD thesis, and returns frequently. He has been taking "people of consequence" there for more than a decade. "I find a special sense of fulfillment and peace there," he says.
But for the moment, he has decided to forgo his own research in the cause of science. "You can do more rattling around in the jungles of power-in many instances right here in this city-than anywhere else in the world," he says.
Mr. Reasonable
"I am utterly convinced that most of the great environmental struggles will be either won or lost in the 1990s, and that by the next century it will be too late to act."
Time and again Tom Lovejoy has delivered that dire warning. (Although his environmental work takes up only about 40 percent of his time, it is what he is most identified with. And because the Smithsonian has been concerned with the biological and cultural heritage of the planet for well over a hundred years, Lovejoy's personal and scientific interests fit right in.)
Yet, just as his brightly colored striped shirts, vibrant bow ties and impish demeanor are not the garb of a Jeremiah, neither are his tactics. "I have always been `Mr. Reasonable,' " he admits.
Frank Talbot, director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, agrees. "Many conservationists move well beyond the established body of knowledge," he says. "Tom doesn't do that. He is dedicated to trying to explain what is happening without being overemotional."
Even so, "I'm really worried," Lovejoy says. "The numbers are already very big: Each year 5 billion tons of carbon accumulate in the atmosphere-it was 3 1/2 billion a couple of years ago. There are 95 million more people every year, 100 acres of tropical deforestation every minute. These are huge numbers. It seems to me at a certain point it gets beyond society's grasp to do anything about it."
He is careful to note that this winter's warm weather could be normal variation. But "spring will be ruined," he laments. "Magnolias just don't bloom in February. Is that just a weird spring or a signal? To be scientifically sound, you have to ask that. But when you have three hurricane-level storms in Great Britain and Europe in two years, and that's only supposed to happen once a century, you begin to worry.
"I think the American public deserves to know the basic, simple facts-unconfused by this week's computer modeling results or next week's," he says. "And the simple facts are that nowhere in the known universe, nowhere in the known history of the planet are and temperature not linked."
Scientist to the Stars
It was that message and that manner that attracted environmental activists in Hollywood looking for a scientific voice to guide them. Several have knocked at Lovejoy's door this past year. Robert Redford, who has worked in the environmental movement for 20 years, was one of the first.
"I like to associate with people who are really experts in the field," says Redford, checking in from Santo Domingo, where he is filming "Havana." "Tom knows what he's talking about. I call him a `biological politician.' In this new age of biological implications we are moving into, he is one of the pioneers.
"He has an extraordinary amount of enthusiasm for what he does-a kind of excitement and joy. It's very contagious. You find yourself wanting to know more."
For his part, Lovejoy is careful about his celebrity contacts. "The last thing I ever want to be seen as is superficial, and there is a danger in being seen that way when you become more of a spokesman or are seen on the tube," he admits. "I'm very, very careful to deal with those celebrities who have real substance-and I'm trying to give them the scientific substance."
Lovejoy is chairman of the advisory committee of the Earth Communications Office, a Los Angeles-based organization dedicated to using the skills of the entertainment industry to raise awareness of environmental issues. Founded by lawyer Bonnie Reiss, ECO includes people from all levels of the industry.
One of its most prominent voices is Tom Cruise, who has called Lovejoy "Indy" ever since he saw him in his field gear when, as part of a group of 20 ECO board members, he visited Lovejoy in the Brazilian rain forest last August.
Lovejoy helps Cruise learn about environmental issues; and when Cruise signed on last year as the voice of Captain Planet, a character in an environmental cartoon series for Ted Turner, he asked that Lovejoy be its scientific adviser. "As an artist, I feel a sense of responsibility to help communicate different things I believe in," says Cruise, calling from the Darlington, S.C., film set of "Days of Thunder."
"I'm not a scientist. I don't know all the technical nomenclature," he says. "But as a citizen, I feel it's my responsibility to do what I can. I want this world for my children to be a better place to be in. Tom is a guide, a teacher, a friend. I use him for a source, for information. At times the newspaper reports can be confusing. I just call Indy, and say, `I read this today, and how accurate is it?' "
Another Lovejoy connection is Sting, the rock star who has established his own rain forest foundation. He also seeks out Lovejoy's expertise when he wants a scientific expert at his side.
"Tom is very aware of how powerful the media is," says Sting. "He's not in his ivory tower blinkered by academic interests. He sees that the subject needs to be presented to the widest possible audience and is aware that the entertainment industry can help.
"But we're going to need advice. We're not going to leave Tom alone. A miracle is not going to happen. It's a struggle-one that involves politics and hard work and scientists; and at the early stage, it involves celebrities. I see our job fading as the right people come into place."
Lovejoy is aware that all this could look a little frivolous. "There are going to be some scientists who will be very critical of my involvement, and say it's not our role to go beyond scientific literature," he says. "I disagree with that utterly. I'm not saying every scientist should be a communicator and an educator, but in the end we do a disservice to society and ourselves if we don't try to interpret for the larger public."
Toads and Orchids
Tom Lovejoy was the kind of boy who pored over Richard Halliburton's "Complete Book of Marvels" and loved to bring home toads-he once hid a chameleon in the curtains. (It couldn't have been easy to arrange; he lived on Manhattan's Upper East Side.) He got serious about science when he went to boarding school at 14. The first school he visited, Millbrook in Duchess County, New York, won out because it had a zoo. "I didn't look anywhere else," he recalls. "That was where I wanted to go." He has been a trustee at Millbrook since 1971.
Lovejoy's curiosity about the natural world led him to biology at Yale, where his freshman adviser was on the staff of the Peabody Museum of Natural History. Within 10 days of arriving, he had met the museum's director, S. Dillon Ripley, who left for the Smithsonian when Lovejoy was in his senior year. "Everybody was so nice to me," he recalls of those days. "They were so happy someone was interested."
He stayed at Yale for his PhD, where his thesis introduced bird-banding to Brazil and gave him the opportunity to avoid the family business (insurance) in favor of the birds and the bees. To this day he is grateful to his late father for encouraging his offbeat interests. After starting out with bird projects in Kenya, Brazil and Long Island, his career eventually took him to the World Wildlife Fund. The ecosystems project that he initiated there brought him world attention in the scientific community.
These days Lovejoy's base of operations is his office in the Smithsonian Castle-orchids from the horticulture department are delivered there weekly as one of his perks-and fax machines wherever he is. Close at hand are his three key facilitators: Carmen Thorndike, his gatekeeper, Marc Pachter, his principal deputy, and Tom McCance, a deputy assistant secretary responsible for membership and development. Lovejoy admits that that the daily influx is daunting, and that he is learning about pacing himself. "I can't push it as much in my terminal forties as I could in my terminal thirties," he says.
His current enthusiasm lies in helping the institution increase its private income. To that end, he and McCance have drummed up plans to encourage membership and private giving to the Smithsonian on a national scale. "If we don't do something soon, we're going to end up focused on internal tensions scrapping over smaller and smaller increments of money, and that's a very poor use of the institution's potential," he explains.
Lovejoy's regimen leaves him little time for a personal life. Divorced for 13 years, he lives alone in McLean in a former early-18th-century inn made of logs and mortar. Its decorating style (family furniture, an old sofa upholstered in an Audubon print fabric, rare books, unframed snapshots) is authentic upper-class casual.
He gets up at 5 a.m. to run (or in summer, to swim), and is at his desk by 8, having already listed on a small yellow pad the things he wants to accomplish that day. He drives an aging Volkswagen, is scheduled for virtually every lunch and dinner and whisks into black tie at the office when necessary. This winter he took to sporting a bright-blue ski jacket over his pin stripes, an act he un-self-consciously describes as a conscious decision to opt for informality and spirit.
Reading is squeezed in late at night and on planes (where he also catches up on movies). A skilled cook, he entertains frequently, often using vegetables from his garden. Particularly regular guests are his three daughters: 22-year-old twins Elizabeth, a senior at American University, and Katherine, a senior at Denison University in Ohio, and Anne, 19, a sophomore at Yale. (Although he describes his financial situation as "comfortable," he shakes his head at the reality of three sets of college bills.)
A devotee of traditional performing arts until he got involved with Hollywood last year, Lovejoy didn't know much about popular culture-and before then didn't have a television set until he got tired of asking his ex-wife, Mopsy, a respiratory therapist, if he could come over and watch his TV program. The two maintain a friendly relationship, celebrating certain holidays and their birthdays together. Born 10 days apart, they are planning to celebrate their joint "hundredth" birthday at the Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado.
"If I was able to design a totally tranquil life, I'd be at home at least three or four weekends out of four," he says, "to enjoy the garden more, to read, to putter. There's a lot to be said for puttering."
Greasing the Wheels
The Brazilians have a word for it: jeito, knowing how to grease the wheels, how to reach the right people to get things done. Lovejoy, who has a world-class Rolodex and is perfectly at ease dropping lines like "I always made it my business to get to know my more interesting cousins," doesn't know quite how he came by the talent. But at this point in his life, he is delighted to discover that old friends are turning up just about everywhere he needs them: foundations, the Senate, the new government in Brazil.
"If Secretary Adams wants to open any closed door, there is nobody better at putting the key in the lock than Tom Lovejoy," says his friend Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.).
Technically, working the corridors of power is not in Lovejoy's job description. But there are times when it has certainly helped. Last December, for example, after a group of scientists from the Smithsonian's tropical research station in Panama was taken hostage during the American invasion, Lovejoy was called to the situation room from his office Christmas party. He made two phone calls. Within 20 minutes, a representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was on the phone, and by the next day, the hostages were rescued.
"I used to hate to complain and still hate to," says Lovejoy, "but with 11 people in the jungle, you do your best."
What has given him particular visibility, however, is not only knowing powerful people but his ability to instruct and persuade them. "Tom understands the importance of strong Hill connections and strong Hill support," says Wren Wirth, an environmental activist and the wife of Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.). "He understands that it is in the Smithsonian's interest."
"He is particularly adept at making the work of the Smithsonian directly relevant to the challenges we face in the coming decades," says Sen. Al Gore (D-Tenn.). "He manages to translate science into the vocabulary of policy-makers."
Lovejoy has by now guided 7 percent of the U.S. Senate and three congressmen around the Amazon rain forest; in particular, he takes them to a camp at the Minimum Critical Size of Ecosystems study that he started in 1979 as a joint research project of the World Wildlife Fund-U.S. and Brazil's National Institute for Amazon Research.
The experiment was designed to establish the minimum size needed for sustaining biological diversity in national parks and biological reserves.
The rain forests, scientists point out, are the biologically richest parts of the planet. But as ranchers, farmers and the economic needs of the people of Brazil have encroached upon them, destroying a greater area of the forest each year, they have become a symbol of the urgent need for international cooperation in the preservation of plant and animal species.
Lovejoy, who led five groups of visitors to the Brazilian rain forest last year, seems to be a particularly persuasive advocate. His prescription:
"Unless you help solve the problem of the people who live in the tropics you haven't really solved anything. You have to give them alternative ways to live in the forest without destroying it. Nothing is going to work without that.
"In a larger sense, we also need to make sure that the tropical countries get a fair return for wise management of the forest. Too often the profits from products deriving from the rain forest go to northern, industrialized nations with no return to the country that supplies the basic genetic material.
"Finally, our behavior at home affects our ability to lead abroad. We need a less wasteful way of life in this country, through simple things like recycling and energy conservation, so that efforts to help tropical nations don't become hypocritical."
Observes John Heinz, who went on one of the trips, "The rain forest is not in most senators' or congressmen's back yard. Our attention is drawn to the Superfund site or the proposed trash dump before we can focus on the destruction of the rain forest in the Amazon. But the implications for global warming are immense. The damage to the genetic endowment and bio-diversity of the planet is immense. I thought the trip was probably a waste of time-not because the rain forest lacked importance to me, but because I didn't believe that anything could be done to save it. I came back convinced we simply had to try harder-the loss to the planet would be incalculable."
Lovejoy's international contacts also have been useful in promoting another of his original conservation projects: the so-called "debt-for-nature" swaps, in which conservation groups purchase part of a country's debt to foreign banks at a discount in order to redeem it in the country's currency and use it for local environmental projects. Lovejoy originally promoted the idea in an op-ed piece in the New York Times in 1984, and has played an active role in swaps in Ecuador, Costa Rica and Madagascar. More recently, after a conversation with Bush at the first meeting of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, Lovejoy drafted a debt-for-nature proposal about nature protection in Panama.
"Panama is basically a 100 percent natural rain forest," he says. "But a good chunk of it is gone-easily half of it. A debt-for-nature swap would deal with the immediate crisis. But there is no long-term security in any of these small tropical countries unless you can set up a stable system for a permanent conservation presence."
Out and About
Despite Lovejoy's outgoing but low-key presentation, his high profile could engender friction or jealousy among his peers. (So could his defiantly populist notions-such as involving the Smithsonian in global climate change comic books or working with McDonald's to provide environmental information on its tray liners.) Does it? Is his iconoclastic approach to representing the Smithsonian seen as appropriate? How do people really feel about his heading off to Brazil to meet with the country's new president, or to educate movie stars and senators in the rain forest?
His colleagues are not altogether comfortable addressing the issue head-on. One of the unusual things about the Smithsonian, after all, is that it is expected that the museum directors and assistant secretaries will want to advance their specialties.
"That's one of the things that appealed to me about coming to work here," agrees Tom Freudenheim, the assistant secretary for museums. "It's an environment that assumes people will do their own thing in any number of ways-but that doesn't mean there isn't going to be resentment. But I'm not the butt of it because I don't go to exotic places like Brazil; I go to New York."
Undersecretary Anderson approves of the Lovejoy outreach. "It's very intelligent of Tom to carefully involve a sampling of celebrities in his activities. It has a multiplier effect with regard to public opinion. It's to our benefit, and to the benefit of areas we are trying to preserve for the next century."
Smithsonian Secretary Adams is less sure, and admits that hanging out with celebrities is not his style. But he's not going to tell Lovejoy how to do his job. "As I see it, the crux of the position is interacting with and being effective and helping to provide understanding for people who are decision-makers," he says. "But you have to let people have their own individual style in these matters."
Says Lovejoy, who appreciates the loose leash, "The institution, like any large enterprise, can easily lapse into a sort of self-satisfied insularity-that's an exaggeration, but that tendency is there. Whereas in the past it might have been able to afford to do that, or might have been able to afford to limit its outreach mainly to the Washington community and certain key elements on Capitol Hill, I think the future promise of the institution depends squarely on getting out and about.
"Maybe there are some things the Smithsonian shouldn't get involved with," he continues. "But any institution that has reluctance to sully its scholarly skirts by not reaching out to the larger community is not meeting its responsibilities." Period.
It is the future he is concerned about-that year 2000 that he fears we risk not reaching. The United States has special responsibilities, he believes. ("When you live as well as the United States does and have as advanced a higher education system as we do, there are some responsibilities that come with that privilege.") And so does the Smithsonian.
"America no longer has a real enemy that has provided the polarity in our society for 30 years," he points out. "There is a sense of `where are we now?' We no longer have economic domination. We are in the process of becoming something different.
"I think in the end, if we want to continue to be leaders, it will have to be in large part as intellectual leaders. And the Smithsonian has to be right there. At a time of the regrouping of the American republic, I think this place is dead in the water unless it begins to reach out in a systematic way."

In West, U.S. Stands Alone on Warming Issue; Europeans Display Unity on Stabilizing Gases: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: As head of a White House task force on global warming, [D. Allan Bromley] has played a key role in the administration's efforts to develop a cohesive policy on global warming. The group meets every six weeks and reports to the domestic policy council and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, the leading skeptic of global warming. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly is the strongest advocate of direct action on global warming within the administration, but has fought an uphill battle against economic conservatives led by Sununu. And he lost a key ally when Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has sided with Reilly on key policy disputes with Sununu, including last February's decision by Sununu to water down a speech [Bush] delivered to an international conference here, recused himself from policy debates that could influence his oil and gas interests. The administration supports such "an insurance policy," said Bromley, even as it remains skeptical over the prospect of global warming. Passage of the Clean Air Act, he said, will limit any possibility of warming, he said, since it will foster more efficient use of energy. The United States is also committed to phasing out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), another important warming gas.

Full text: Preparing for a major international climate conference now meeting in Geneva, the World Meteorological Organization circulated a draft declaration reflecting the commitment of European governments to stabilize the production of gases believed to cause global warming.
The United States responded with a series of caveats and weakening amendments as long as the declaration itself.
While virtually every Western industrialized nation has committed itself to specific timetables for stabilizing or reducing the gases that cause the greenhouse effect, the Bush administration remains skeptical that global warming is scientifically valid and refuses to take any direct action that threatens the way the United States generates energy and runs its economy.
Emphasizing the wait-and-see policy, White House Science Adviser D. Allan Bromley noted the administration has budgeted $500 million budget for research into climate change and said more conclusive evidence is necessary before the nation restricts use of critical fossil fuels-oil, coal and gas-that produce carbon dioxide when burned.
"I think the taxpayers would want that," he said in an interview.
As head of a White House task force on global warming, Bromley has played a key role in the administration's efforts to develop a cohesive policy on global warming. The group meets every six weeks and reports to the domestic policy council and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, the leading skeptic of global warming.
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly is the strongest advocate of direct action on global warming within the administration, but has fought an uphill battle against economic conservatives led by Sununu. And he lost a key ally when Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has sided with Reilly on key policy disputes with Sununu, including last February's decision by Sununu to water down a speech Bush delivered to an international conference here, recused himself from policy debates that could influence his oil and gas interests.
Anticipating how isolated the United States will be in Geneva, Reilly, sources said, warned John Knauss, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the administration's representative at the conference: "Roll up your sleeves and give blood, John. We're just going to get beaten up."
The administration's caution on the issue has been a disappointment to environmentalists, given President Bush's pledge during his 1988 campaign to use the "White House effect" to combat the "greenhouse effect," the popular term for describing the effect of gases that blanket the Earth and trap solar heat. The buildup of those gases has led to fears that the planet will warm significantly.
European governments, with popular environmental movements to placate, have created pressure for Bush by moving faster with concrete targets for stabilizing emissions of greenhouse gases by the turn of the century. But the administration defends its go-slow approach by noting the economic and political differences from Europe, where nuclear energy and high energy taxes are accepted alternatives. The United States also has further to go to combat per capita emissions of carbon dioxide, which more than double those of Japan and France.
In place of targeted cuts, officials such as Bromley point to research programs and the incidental carbon dioxide reductions achieved by other environmental policies. Still, carbon dioxide emissions are expected to grow 15 percent by the year 2000.
"They don't want to think about the tough decisions they would have to make if they admitted the problem is real," said Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), a leading critic of the administration's global warming position.
A year ago, Bromley said the administration would await the outcome of a U.N.-sponsored assessment of global warming before formulating remedial policies. But when the report in late September concluded that the planet will warm 5 degrees by the end of next century, Bromley said it raised as many questions as it did answers.
"Before we commit ourselves to massive mitigation schemes, we want to be sure of what the costs and what the effects will be, particularly on a regional basis," Bromley said.
Bromley said, for example, that of the six major climate models, three predict that the American midwest will be hotter and drier in the coming century, while three predict cooler, wetter weather. He has repeatedly said that the climate models are not accurate enough to base public policy.
For the present, many members of the scientific community support a "no regrets" policy, in which the United States and other governments would attempt to limit the production of carbon dioxide and other gases for reasons that made sense even if there is no significant warming trend in the world climate.
The administration supports such "an insurance policy," said Bromley, even as it remains skeptical over the prospect of global warming. Passage of the Clean Air Act, he said, will limit any possibility of warming, he said, since it will foster more efficient use of energy. The United States is also committed to phasing out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), another important warming gas.
But more ambitious plans to cut carbon dioxide run into the hard realities of an economy dependent on fossil fuels as its energy staple. Economic models to predict the cost of mitigating global warming are still in their infancy. While some analyses make the cost seem almost negligible, others project huge costs, which have been a major cause of concern for Sununu and other administration officials.
An interagency group formed by the Energy Department recently put the costs at $50 billion a year-or 1 percent of the nation's annual Gross National Product-to stabilize global warming emissions by the year 2005.
"You're talking about major changes in the structure of economic activity," said Richard Schmalensee, a member off the White House Council of Economic Advisers. "There is the brute fact we use a lot of energy. If you're going to cut down carbon dioxide, you're going to have to figure out how to use less coal. History gives us no reason to think it will be cheap."
According to the Energy Department, the price for stabilizing global warming emissions by 2005 would be a tax of $100 on each ton of carbon contained in fossil fuels. That would nearly triple the price of coal and double the price of oil.
"If you impose unnecessarily high taxes or punitive measures on one sector of the economy, you might penalize economic growth," said Mark Kerrigan, associate deputy undersecretary of energy.
At yesterday's meeting in Geneva, the United States appeared to prevail in its efforts to water down the conference declaration to be issued on the final session Wednesday.
While the preliminary text had proposed specific targets to stabilize emissions by industrialized nations, the latest draft "welcomes" the European commitments but omits any reference to responsibilities of other countries.

Abstract: As to the specific role plants may play in the global climate, [Curtis Moore] correctly stated that plants take in carbon dioxide during a process called photosynthesis and under certain conditions they also give off some of this carbon dioxide during respiration. However, a plant does not create new carbon; it only cycles it. Moore also failed to mention that carbon is a basic element of wood. From the moment an acorn sprouts until the mighty oak reaches its demise perhaps 100 or more years later, more and more carbon is stored in its roots, trunk and branches-carbon which has been removed from the air and soil. With regard to "killer trees," Moore reports new evidence that as temperatures rise trees actually give off more pollutants than they absorb, contributing to the warming trend. If so, it is interesting to weigh these facts alongside those reported by William Booth in your newspaper July 16: according to researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, the primary cause of "whopping" temperature increases in Atlanta since the mid-'70s is the loss of 20 percent of the city's trees. Planting more trees in urban areas would tend to lower urban temperatures and thus lower related air pollution.

Full text: Curtis Moore's hypothesis that plants may be our own worst enemy {"Revenge of the Killer Trees," Outlook, July 29} is a radical departure from the views of many respected scientists.
Still unknown is what effect this increasing concentration of greenhouse gases may have on global climate during our lifetime and beyond. We are just beginning to grasp some of the complex factors that govern our climate; a full understanding of their interaction is years away at best. This lack of scientific consensus is not an excuse for inaction; rather we as a global society must strive to practice stewardship of our resources through energy conservation, recycling, prudent management our our forest resources and, yes, the planting of many new trees, shrubs and other plants.
As to the specific role plants may play in the global climate, Moore correctly stated that plants take in carbon dioxide during a process called photosynthesis and under certain conditions they also give off some of this carbon dioxide during respiration. However, a plant does not create new carbon; it only cycles it. Moore also failed to mention that carbon is a basic element of wood. From the moment an acorn sprouts until the mighty oak reaches its demise perhaps 100 or more years later, more and more carbon is stored in its roots, trunk and branches-carbon which has been removed from the air and soil.
The author's "vicious carbon cycle" is a natural one; plants both take in and give off carbon dioxide as they grow, but there is a net accumulation of carbon in the plant. Thus if carbon dioxide is contributing to global climate change, then plants offer one method for removing much carbon from the atmosphere.
-Craig J. Regelbrugge The writer is director of regulatory affairs and grower services at the American Association of Nurserymen.
Let's not cut down all those trees planted on Earth Day just yet. Curtis Moore's concerns seem to miss the obvious understanding that in the final analysis, trees are an increasingly essential part of our environment.
Moore has a record of staunch environmental advocacy, and I applaud his intellectual honesty in exploring the "bewildering complex of interactions subsumed under the simple label `global warming.' " All sides agree that while we can make an educated guess that man's impact on the global atmosphere could lead to a "global warming," we cannot with confidence estimate the size or impacts of climate change or when and where it might appear.
The facts on global warming suggest, therefore, a dual track policy: reduce the scientific uncertainties as rapidly as possible, and take every action which can be justified as an "insurance policy" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On the first track, U.S. funding for meaningful climate change research-roughly $600 million in 1990 and up to $1 billion for 1991-is enormous, larger than that of any other nation, at a time when our share of global greenhouse emissions is about 25 percent and declining. On the second track, several Bush administration initiatives are underway which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15 to 25 percent below projected levels in the year 2000. Action and research are proceeding in tandem.
With regard to "killer trees," Moore reports new evidence that as temperatures rise trees actually give off more pollutants than they absorb, contributing to the warming trend. If so, it is interesting to weigh these facts alongside those reported by William Booth in your newspaper July 16: according to researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, the primary cause of "whopping" temperature increases in Atlanta since the mid-'70s is the loss of 20 percent of the city's trees. Planting more trees in urban areas would tend to lower urban temperatures and thus lower related air pollution.
Urban forestry is the heart of President Bush's campaign to plant and improve 1 billion new trees every year for the next 10 years. Moreover, an appreciation for the invaluable functions of trees is also at the heart of the president's recent call for a global forestry convention to be completed by 1992. President Bush knows that trees are both symbols and soldiers in our campaign to protect the environment.
-Michael R. Deland The writer is chairman of the President's Council on Environmental Quality.

Abstract: At the center of administration concerns is the fate of fossil fuels - targeted by European regulators because when burned in engines or industrial plants they produce the principal warming gas, carbon dioxide. The United States is much more dependent on coal and oil than is Europe, which uses far more nuclear power. Among its major industrial trading partners - Japan, Europe and Canada - only the United States has resisted plans to control carbon dioxide. Indeed, U.S. emissions, already a quarter of the world total, are expected to grow 15 percent by the year 2000. Most economists agree that the easiest and fairest way to reduce the use of fossil fuels is to tax their extraction. The higher prices engendered by the fee, based on the carbon content of the fuel, supposedly would discourage consumption. The tax would be raised until it dampened demand for fossil fuel enough to achieve the desired reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

Full text: Here in Coors country, the first casualty of a war against global warming could be the price of a cold beer.
Most plans to prevent the planet from overheating feature hefty taxes on the source of warming gases: fossil fuels such as coal and oil used extensively by Adolph Coors Co. to fire brew kettles and run its trucks. "Those {tax} dollars would be pretty hard to absorb," said Bob Mooney, the brewery's energy manager. "It would be a significant pass-on to the consumer."
But 150 miles southwest of here, at the Rocky Mountain Institute, the warming threat is seen as an impetus for savings, not a source of higher costs. To prove his point, Amory Lovins heats his 4,000-square-foot energy research institute without a furnace on sub-zero days and runs heavy office machines, appliances and lights on an electric bill that averages less than $50 a month.
Such contrasting views of a future without cheap fossil fuels transcend the Colorado Rockies to the highest councils of government worldwide, explaining why different nations have different goals for the U.N.-sponsored negotiations on global warming opening in the Washington area today.
The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on a Framework Convention on Climate Change has blocked out the next two years to reach an agreement. Whether the 130 participating nations simply strike a consensus on the seriousness of the threat of global warming or agree on concrete measures to combat it will depend largely on how negotiators compute the implications for their economies.
Until recently, the only estimates were on the costs of global warming - caused by the buildup of heat-trapping gases. The 2- to 6-degree increase in average temperature predicted by some scientists for the next century could wither crops and raise sea levels and inundate coastal towns.
As governments search for solutions to global warming, the investigations of the costs of those remedies have picked up speed.
Forecasts for the U.S. economy vary. Different economists predict a 21st century of staggering energy prices and much higher costs for manufacturers like Coors - or alternatively, an energy-efficient future such as that envisioned by Lovins in which power plants and gas pumps close for lack of need.
The Bush administration is wed to the gloomiest economic predictions. Officials say that the general White House view that national income will decline 3 percent as a result of steps to halt global warming will put a stronger brake on U.S. negotiators than the oft-cited reason to postpone action: scientific uncertainties about how much temperatures will rise and how disruptive global warming will be.
Some officials question whether the cure is harsher than the disease; there are estimates that the damage caused by global warming would reduce national income only 0.25 percent a year.
At the center of administration concerns is the fate of fossil fuels - targeted by European regulators because when burned in engines or industrial plants they produce the principal warming gas, carbon dioxide. The United States is much more dependent on coal and oil than is Europe, which uses far more nuclear power.
Among its major industrial trading partners - Japan, Europe and Canada - only the United States has resisted plans to control carbon dioxide. Indeed, U.S. emissions, already a quarter of the world total, are expected to grow 15 percent by the year 2000.
The costs of reversing that growth are the subject of lively debate. Economists have programmed their most sophisticated computers to project the impact on the U.S. economy of plans by some European nations to freeze emissions of carbon dioxide at current levels by the year 2000 and cut them by up to 20 percent in the next few decades.
Everyone agrees that however those goals are reached would require a profound change in U.S. energy consumption. But there are wide differences of opinion over the economic costs of those changes.
Most economists agree that the easiest and fairest way to reduce the use of fossil fuels is to tax their extraction. The higher prices engendered by the fee, based on the carbon content of the fuel, supposedly would discourage consumption. The tax would be raised until it dampened demand for fossil fuel enough to achieve the desired reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.
According to the analysis most influential with White House advisers, a carbon tax of $250 a ton would be needed, which economists Richard Richels and Alan S. Manne estimate would boost gasoline prices 75 cents a gallon and coal prices five-fold. That would double electricity bills.
For Coors, which runs the world's largest brewery here, the prospect of a carbon tax is about as welcome as a return to prohibition. The company burns 400,000 tons a year to operate its brewing process and 1.2 million gallons of oil to run the inner-brewery fleet.
One response might be to buy more natural gas - Coors already uses 1.75 billion cubic feet a year - to fire its copper brew kettles and huge refrigeration unit, said Coors's Mooney. But the price of natural gas already is twice that of coal, before the carbon tax.
"Any way you cut it, it's going to run up the dollars," Mooney said of the carbon tax.
Manne and Richels believe that higher energy prices resulting from a carbon tax will reduce national production 1 to 5 percent annually, depending on the extent of energy conservation and availability of low-cost alternatives.
"If we're thinking about reducing carbon dioxide emissions today to prevent some damage in the future, the insurance premium will not be inexpensive," said Richels, an energy modeler at Electric Power Research Institute, funded by utilities.
"Until we have a better handle on what's at stake from an environmental damage perspective, its going to be difficult to say whether the benefits {of carbon dioxide controls} justify the cost," he said.
Many consider the analysis of Manne and Richels extreme because it assumes rising energy costs will only mildly diminish consumption, requiring a more onerous tax than other economists believe necessary.
According to a group of Harvard economists, for example, rising energy costs would quickly dampen consumption and spur use of fossil fuel alternatives. They estimate that carbon taxes as low as $45 a ton would achieve a 20 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions.
Another flashpoint in the debate is the potential for improvement in U.S. energy efficiency. Manne and Richels assume it is very limited in the long run.
But Robert H. Williams, an analyst at Princeton University's Center for Energy and Environmental Studies, believes carbon taxes would quicken the development of a "new regime" of low-cost energy sources - such as wind and solar - with such promise for savings that there would be a net economic gain.
If the rate of improvements in energy efficiency meet Williams's expectations - which is three times faster than Manne and Richels assume - U.S. demand for energy would drop by two-thirds over the next 100 years, he said.
There likely is no better illustration of the potential of energy efficiency than Lovins's institute in Snowmass, Colo. Known locally as the "solar castle," the building actually benefits from the "greenhouse effect" by drawing the sun's heat into a large, glass-enclosed room and then distributing it through a system of fans and ducts.
Its energy-saving devices - from compact fluorescent lamps to triple-pane windows and rooftop solar panels - cost $6,000 to install in 1983 and save an estimated $7,100 a year in electricity and heating costs.
According to Lovins, the building demonstrates the vast savings possible were fossil fuels replaced with a little common sense. New technologies for lighting, motors, pumps and car engines are available and have only to be advertised to cut dramatically the nation's need for and cost of energy.
"The carbon dioxide and other pollution avoided by substituting efficiency for fuel is thus avoided not at a cost but at a profit," Lovins said.

Full text: Â  India Blames Industrial Nations.
Environment Minister Maneka Gandhi has put the blame for environmental pollution squarely at the door of industrial countries and demanded they pay the Third World for the consequences.
"They owe it, they are not doing us a favor," Gandhi asserted at a press conference at the conclusion of the two-day White House conference on global change which ended here on April 18.
The much bally-hooed conference ended with a whimper, with no concrete proposals, except an informal agreement to discuss international co-operation for research, an outcome predicted by environmentalists skeptical of the American President's commitment to ecology issues.
The Indian delegation, led by Environment Minister Maneka Gandhi, forcefully outlined he constraints of an environment agenda in a poor country striving to meet development priorities, even as President George Bush emphasized development and the environment were two sides of the same coin.
"In our democratic system," Gandhi told her morning working group which she co-chaired, "it will be rather difficult to convince our parliament of the priority of allocating scarce resources to solve global environmental issues caused by the more affluent countries."
She argued vehemently for a change in the 1986 Montreal protocol which calls on developing countries as well to lay out resources to deal with harmful chloroflourocarbons. Refreshing Honesty
Characterizing the conference as sometimes "banal," with refreshing honesty the youthful minister maintained, "we were dealing with peripheries."
But, she conceded, it was a "very necessary statement for America to make," as many countries looked to it to set the tone.
President Bush's proposals for an international institute for research and a global change data and communications network received lukewarm responses, particularly from Third World countries. America Supported
East European countries, however, tended to support American views. Many delegates to the conference, including the Indians, understood the conference was a means for the American President to strengthen his image as the "environmental president."
Ms. Gandhi said she hoped the research proposed would focus "on what the world needs and not what America needs."
She pointed out that environmental problems had been identified 14 years ago and over the last five years countries had "lurched from conference to conference," without concrete action.
"We are very aggressive on environment, particularly since the last four months," Gandhi said about her tenure in office, highlighting steps such as emission control, compulsory hazardous-waste insurance, the national forestry fund etc.
"The environment ministry has become an important interfere," she said.
She lauded Indian industrialists for their cooperation in adopting measures to curb pollution, and said the government was giving special breaks to industry for adhering to environmental controls.
"But future technologies will actually be cheaper," the minister maintained about the cost-benefit ratio to industry and people.
President Bush, in his concluding address, belaboured the point that the question of climate change should not be characterized as a debate between "economists versus environmentalists."
To allay criticism from environmental groups he stressed "action", maintaining, "we have never considered research a substitute for action." Tremendous Progress
"We have made mistakes," the President admitted, "but over the past century we've made tremendous progress in this country," he added.
Recognizing the controversial nature of the environmental debate, the President called for cooperation.
"Let us neither grieve nor quarrel," he said, "but act on what we know can help."

WASHINGTON -- The federal government should shift about $300 million a year in existing energy research funds to studies that could help cut emissions of greenhouse gasses, a panel of scientists said on Wednesday.
The National Research Council committee, in a 127-page report ordered by Congress, also said the United States should consider launching a much larger new research program in case worries about global warming grow worse.
That program would devote billions of dollars a year to developing what the panel called backstop technologies not now economically viable, but that could be needed if emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have to be cut quickly.
Scientists say atmospheric buildups of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons and other gases -- mostly from burning oil, coal and other fossil fuels as energy sources -- could cause a catastrophic warming of the Earth's temperature in coming decades.
The Bush administration has argued that there is still too much scientific uncertainty over the magnitude of the problem to warrant expensive and economically disruptive policy moves.
The research council's Committee on Alternative Energy Research and Development Strategies, chaired by David L. Morrison of the IIT Research Institute in Chicago, was asked to consider what policy moves should be made if the government decides to take action.
By moving money around in the Energy Department's current research budget, the panel said about $300 million per year should be spent on projects for improving energy efficiency and encouraging adoption of technology that would cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Those steps "would make sense for other reasons even in the absence of concerns about global climate change," the report said.
The committee suggested spending about $15 million a year on research into better electrical storage, $105 million on energy efficiency in buildings, $75 million on recycling and $15 million on transportation.
To find the money, the scientists said the Energy Department could cut research into fusion power, fossil energy and other projects.
No precise cost estimate was offered for what the committee called its insurance strategy for advanced research into renewable energy, conservation, nuclear energy and a range of new ideas that "are clearly not cost- competitive today" in comparison to standard technologies.
"These alternative technologies would be developed to the level necessary to understand their costs and impacts if concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change heighten," the panel said.

Reagan's Final Budget: How Programs Will Fare --- 'Solid and Reasonable' or 'Meaner and Harsher'? Defense Is Favored as Cuts Come Elsewhere

Author: By The Wall Street Journal's Washington Staff

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/reagans-final-budget-how-programs-will-fare-solid/docview/398177457/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Mr. Reagan would save billions by making federal employees pay more for health insurance, skipping the 1990 cost-of-living increase for federal retirees and raising salaries for most civilian workers by only 2% next year while boosting military pay by 3.6%. (For members of Congress and senior federal officials, however, the president proposes a 50% pay boost.) He would also save $3.9 billion by eliminating 82 government programs, including agencies like the Legal Services Corporation and the Economic Development Administration that have survived past Reagan attacks. Mr. Reagan doesn't propose any significant Medicare reforms, but would reduce projected Medicare spending by $5 billion by cutting back federal outlays for hospital capital projects and teaching hospitals and nearly eliminating any inflation-related increases in Medicare doctors' fees. Even with these cuts, Medicare will cost $8 billion more in fiscal 1990 than in 1989. Mr. Reagan may have read George Bush's lips and shunned new taxes, but he wasn't very generous with Mr. Bush's top priorities. Mr. Reagan proposes to cut spending on natural resources and the environment by 12.4% in fiscal 1990, though he does propose increased outlays by the Environmental Protection Agency and the hazardous-waste cleanup program. Education outlays would rise only 2.1% in fiscal 1990, excluding accounting changes. Administration officials actually wanted to propose cuts in education spending to make it easier for Mr. Bush to top Mr. Reagan's request, but Mr. Reagan personally rejected the idea.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Reagan administration doesn't pretend that its last budget is kinder or gentler. "This budget is a good, solid, reasonable, conservative budget," Budget Director Joseph Wright said yesterday.
But Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, a Democrat, was quick to add: "It provides a formula for a meaner, harsher America."
President Reagan proposes to increase the defense budget 2% faster than inflation while proposing to restrain the growth in Medicare, to cut back farm programs and to squeeze current and retired federal employees.
Mr. Reagan would save billions by making federal employees pay more for health insurance, skipping the 1990 cost-of-living increase for federal retirees and raising salaries for most civilian workers by only 2% next year while boosting military pay by 3.6%. (For members of Congress and senior federal officials, however, the president proposes a 50% pay boost.) He would also save $3.9 billion by eliminating 82 government programs, including agencies like the Legal Services Corporation and the Economic Development Administration that have survived past Reagan attacks.
Medicare, the fast-growing health-care program for the elderly, is one of Mr. Reagan's biggest targets, and for good reason. "The federal budget is like the Titanic on its way toward the Medicare budget," Mr. Wright said. Without changes, Medicare will cost more than Social Security in 15 years and, by 2015, will exceed Social Security and the defense budget combined.
Mr. Reagan doesn't propose any significant Medicare reforms, but would reduce projected Medicare spending by $5 billion by cutting back federal outlays for hospital capital projects and teaching hospitals and nearly eliminating any inflation-related increases in Medicare doctors' fees. Even with these cuts, Medicare will cost $8 billion more in fiscal 1990 than in 1989.
The Reagan budget offers very few new ideas. One is that the government, not manufacturers, should get the windfall profits from higher prices that will result from new international restrictions on the production of chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals that damage the atmosphere. Another is that the U.S. Postal Service, while increasing rates for political-advocacy mail and advertising by $90 million, should cut federal government postal costs by $346 million because "government mail is easier and cheaper to handle."
Mr. Reagan may have read George Bush's lips and shunned new taxes, but he wasn't very generous with Mr. Bush's top priorities. Mr. Reagan proposes to cut spending on natural resources and the environment by 12.4% in fiscal 1990, though he does propose increased outlays by the Environmental Protection Agency and the hazardous-waste cleanup program. Education outlays would rise only 2.1% in fiscal 1990, excluding accounting changes. Administration officials actually wanted to propose cuts in education spending to make it easier for Mr. Bush to top Mr. Reagan's request, but Mr. Reagan personally rejected the idea.
Health
Mr. Reagan's budget request for the Department of Health and Human Services continues attempts to limit Medicare and Medicaid payments but increases AIDS-related outlays. The $424 billion proposal is a 5.7% increase over this fiscal year and nearly 37% of planned federal spending.
Spending by the Public Health Service to fight acquired immune deficiency syndrome through research and prevention would rise by 24%, to $1.6 billion.
Budget outlays for Medicare are expected to rise to $105.8 billion, a 10.4% increase, although federal officials plan to cut the rate of payment increase to hospitals for medical services and to reduce capital payments. Plans also call for reduced payments to doctors for "overpriced procedures" and an 8% cut for radiology, anesthesiology and surgery services. Mr. Bush has promised a new look at the issue of long-term health-care insurance.
Federal Medicaid payments would be cut by more than $1 billion from the amount needed to maintain current services, and the elimination of enhanced administrative match rates to the states could result in benefit cutbacks to the low-income recipients in some states. But the overall Medicaid budget would increase to $35.9 billion from $34.3 billion.
Welfare
The president proposes to cut spending by the Family Support Administration, which oversees the major federal welfare programs, by more than $800 million to $13.5 billion. The budget also reflects the broad changes in Aid to Families with Dependent Children and child support programs mandated by the welfare revision law passed in October.
Federal payments to the states, which administer the programs, are set to drop to $10.8 billion from $11.3 billion. That includes funding for child care, program administration and $8.4 billion in benefits for 1990, compared with $8.9 billion this fiscal year.
The White House calls for no direct reduction in benefit payments to families, but plans to cap state administrative costs and eliminate special enhanced matching rates could result in some states deciding to cut benefits if state officials feel they cannot cut their own administrative expenses.
Housing
The president's budget proposes trimming certain housing assistance and community-development programs, and adding or increasing fees charged government-sponsored housing finance agencies. The proposals have had only limited success in the past but could become more attractive to Congress given rising concern about the deficit.
Despite the proposed cuts, overall spending for the Department of Housing and Urban Development would rise 1.9% to $22.59 billion, reflecting past commitments and newly enacted legislation.
Money for housing assistance for the poor would rise 1% to about $13.60 billion. Spending for programs for the homeless would increase to $186.7 million from $85.1 million. The administration proposes providing funds for housing vouchers -- direct rent subsidies -- for an additional 100,000 families, up from 146,000 currently.
The so-called Nehemiah program, designed to assist low-income and moderate-income families buy specially subsidized homes, would be eliminated, as would the Urban Development Action Grants intended to spur private development in distressed areas.
The administration proposes to raise $59 million in fees on securities issued by the government-chartered, private corporations that operate in the secondary mortgage market.
Education
Administration officials say the number of student-aid recipients and the total amount of financial aid available would increase, even though a major assistance program, guaranteed student loans, is slated for cuts.
Expenditures for the loan program, under which the federal government backs loans made by banks and other lenders, would be cut to $3 billion from $3.2 billion. The savings would result from sharing more of the default risk with lenders and reducing a special allowance paid to them by the federal government. The maximum Pell Grant wouldn't be increased to account for inflation and would stay at $2,300.
President-elect Bush, who campaigned on the idea of making education a priority in his administration, has promised to spend more in certain areas than the Reagan administration.
Education Department budget outlays would edge up to $21.2 billion from $20.6 billion. More than one-fifth of the spending plan is scheduled for increasing services to disadvantaged children, something Mr. Bush has pushed. He also advocates new or expanded programs for merit schools, magnet schools and preschools.
Employment
Total help for dislocated workers would decline under the Reagan budget despite the major expansion envisioned by Congress when it wrote a new program into the trade bill last year.
The budget would still boost general spending for counseling, job-search aid and skills training by $67 million, to $331 million in fiscal 1990. But the budget moves to end training and benefits earmarked under a 1974 trade law for workers who lose their jobs due to adverse trade effects, slashing outlays to $89 million from $374 million in the current year. Officials said those workers would be equally well served under the new plan, called the Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance program, and by continuing unemployment insurance.
The total is well short of the $980 million envisioned in the new trade bill, but budget-minded lawmakers aren't likely to insist on adding a lot to the budget.
The budget also calls for reductions in employment-service grants to states and in federal tax credits for employers who hire disadvantaged workers.
Transportation
A request for a substantial increase in the Federal Aviation Administration's budget will be applauded by Congress, but proposals to end Amtrak subsidies and reduce highway funds may be rebuffed.
Overall Transportation Department spending would be $27.32 billion under the president's budget, up slightly from $27.07 billion for the current fiscal year. The administration proposes a 16% increase in FAA outlays, to $6.63 billion, including a hefty increase in expenditures for the long-term modernization of air-traffic-control equipment.
The budget includes funds for an additional 695 air traffic controllers, 400 airline-safety inspectors and 120 security personnel. It proposes ending the essential air service program, which provides subsidies to airlines serving small and medium-sized communities that otherwise might lose air service. Congress has blocked past efforts to kill the program.
The Coast Guard budget would rise modestly. But spending for highway programs would be cut 1.2%, to $13.43 billion. Amtrak subsidies and discretionary grants for mass transit would be eliminated. Congress has stymied past efforts to make such cuts.
Space & Science
Research-and-development spending would grow 8% to $66.7 billion, with more than half of the outlays for defense programs.
Among the projects slated for big increases are the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space station, for which spending would roughly double to $2.1 billion, and the Energy Department's superconducting supercollider, which would get $250 million to start construction, up from $100 million. Both face stiff opposition in Congress, however, and may be scaled back.
The administration also proposes to earmark $191 million to study changes in global climates, a 42% increase, and $287 million to research superconductors, up 14%.
Separately, NASA's total spending would increase 19% to $12.6 billion, which includes $30 million to start a project to launch unmanned spacecraft to Saturn and a comet. The National Science Foundation is slated for a spending increase of 9% to $2 billion.
Energy
The nation's problem-ridden nuclear-weapons plants, under the Energy Department's care, captured the most attention and new money among programs run by the department..
Mr. Reagan is seeking $702 million extra, primarily to modernize and improve safety and environmental conditions at the 17 nuclear defense sites; he rejected the energy secretary's appeal for even more. The request would almost double, to $300 million from $160 million, the money to clean up old wastes, but Mr. Bush will be under pressure to keep campaign promises and seek more -- if not this year, then later. The new president also will have to decide if the country needs two new tritium reactors; the Reagan budget seeks $304 million for design work on two -- in South Carolina and Idaho.
In a cost-cutting vein, the administration for the first time is proposing that commercial nuclear-power plants pick up 100% of Nuclear Regulatory Commission costs; they now pay 45%. It also proposes cutting back strategic oil reserve purchases to 22,000 barrels a day from an average of 50,000 barrels, unless two fields in the Naval Petroleum Reserve can be sold as previously proposed.
Mr. Bush can be expected to seek tax incentives for U.S. oil and gas producers, as he promised in his campaign. But they won't necessarily come in his first-year budget request.
Environment
Tight budgets would funnel limited dollars to priority projects on clean air, radon, groundwater pollution, research on global climate change and stepped-up eradication of marijuana on public lands.
A proposal would attempt to recoup up to $7 billion through the year 2000 by capturing windfall profits from producers phasing out the production of ozone-depleting chemicals. Another idea is to share the cost of fighting fires in national parks and other public lands with states and localities by deducting fire-protection costs from states' share of federal mineral and timber receipts.
The Environmental Protection Agency's spending would rise $344 million to $5.58 billion, while Interior Department spending would drop $510 million to $6.84 billion primarily because of continued curbs on acquisition of park and refuge lands. Interior counts on getting $2.1 billion in fees from oil drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, but Congress has yet to permit drilling.
Congress will likely balk again at deferring park-land purchases and at the continued attempt to cut state sewage-treatment grants. While Mr. Bush has promised to be strong on environmental issues, he may resort to no-cost regulatory initiatives at first.
Agriculture
Agriculture Department spending would be slashed 18%, with rural housing and farm-credit outlays taking the sharpest cuts.
The department is budgeted to spend $42.4 billion in fiscal 1990, down from $52.1 billion this year. Farm-income supports and other subsidies would decrease $2.3 billion, or 17%, to $11.6 billion as a result of reductions foreseen in cotton price-supports and disaster payments. An additional $2 billion would be saved under anticipated farm-policy changes, including a $1.1 billion subsidy cut that would require congressional approval.
Spending on food-stamp and nutrition programs would slip 3% to $20.6 billion. U.S. Forest Service outlays would fall 13% to $2.5 billion, while federal crop-insurance outlays would drop 53% to $586 million as the government wraps up settlement of drought-damage claims.
Farmers Home Administration spending would take a 63% cut -- to $2.9 billion from $8 billion -- under two proposals that the Reagan administration has pushed previously, but with limited success. One proposal would speed the shift to guaranteed farm loans from direct loans; the other would abolish the FmHA's rural housing-loan programs in favor of rental vouchers to low-income residents.
Law Enforcement
The budget for the Justice Department and the federal courts would climb $800 million to $10.7 billion, more than half going to law enforcement, with a heavy emphasis on the war against drugs.
The department's $6.8 billion request includes $215 million for 13 regional task forces to combat drug trafficking plus funding for 164 new Drug Enforcement Administration agents. The budget for criminal investigations is in line for a 15% increase to $2.5 billion.
Anti-drug legislation passed by Congress last year fueled some of the budget increases, including a 14% boost to support expansion of the prison system. Congress could demand even greater spending for anti-drug programs, especially since the Federal Bureau of Investigation is in line for only a 4.6% increase. Federal funding for state and local anti-drug abuse grants is also being cut by $148 million.
Foreign Aid
Foreign-aid spending would jump to $17.3 billion from $10.7 billion this year, when foreign loan repayments substantially reduced the net spending total.
The budget includes $150 million for a new spending program to help promote democracy in the Philippines. The U.S. is trying to persuade Japan and other wealthy nations to join the effort.
Spending for United Nations dues would rise to $692 million from $503 million this year, enough to resume full payments and begin paying past dues that previously had been withheld. The U.S. would provide $111 million for U.N. peacekeeping efforts, up from $29 million.
The U.S. would provide $150 million for a new program at the International Monetary Fund to help the poorest countries.
This year, foreign-aid spending was offset by $5 billion in loan repayments to the U.S. from nations refinancing old debts.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The bottom line on President Bush's budget boils down to this: Read my lips. Don't worry about the deficit this year.
In his rhetoric, Mr. Bush stresses the importance of bringing the deficit under control. In his budget numbers, he dutifully proposes cuts in government benefit programs to offset his tax cuts, as required by the 1990 budget law, and devotes the peace dividend to reducing the deficit.
But in an introduction written by his budget director, Richard Darman, the president all but throws in the towel. Mr. Darman says the president "would be prepared to consider" a plan from Congress that ignored the politically painful benefit cuts and instead used the cuts in military spending to pay for a tax reduction for American families.
The statement "just sort of surrenders before the war starts," says economist Rudolph Penner of the Urban Institute, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. "I've never seen anything like that in the budget before. He says: If you don't like it, do something else."
And that something else is likely to mean a budget deficit even bigger than Mr. Bush's budget projects: a record-busting $399 billion in the current fiscal year and $351.9 billion in fiscal 1993, which begins Oct. 1.
If adopted as proposed, Mr. Bush's budget would reduce the deficit significantly in later years -- without relying too heavily on accounting changes that the administration is suggesting or on overly optimistic economic assumptions. Outlays would rise only 2.8% to $1.516 trillion in fiscal 1993 and would fall 2.8% the following year. Total federal outlays would actually be lower in fiscal 1994 than in fiscal 1992.
"The president has sent to Congress a budget that on the face of it . . . would reduce the deficit over time and at the same time proposes things we ought to do to stimulate the economy and promote growth," says Carol Cox Waite, president of the private Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
"But then the budget director says: You don't have to make all these hard choices. I will give you some defense saving and some creative accounting and you can slide by another year. It's shocking. That's the only word for it."
At a briefing, Mr. Darman acknowledged that "there could be a modest adverse effect on the deficit" if Congress accepts the invitation he is extending.
"The peace dividend, as a matter of principle, should be available primarily for deficit reduction, but if a portion of it is needed in order to get the {$500-a-child increase in the} personal exemption through, then the president would be prepared to consider it, under some pretty stringent circumstances," Mr. Darman said.
The conditions he lists include lowering the spending ceilings set in the budget law so Congress can't both spend the peace dividend and use it to cut taxes. They also include limiting defense cuts to those proposed by the president: cutting the Pentagon's spending authority by $50 billion so that actual cash outlays fall by $27.4 billion over five years; the remaining savings would come in later years.
In short, Mr. Darman is laying out the conditions for bipartisan budget negotiations this year and saying, in effect, that the administration will go along with a wider deficit in the short term in exchange for mechanisms designed to reduce the deficit in the future.
Robert Reischauer, the current director of the Congressional Budget Office, sees some wisdom in Mr. Darman's tacticsand he doesn't often. "What {Mr.} Darman is basically doing is putting constraints on the bidding war that might take place," Mr. Reischauer says. "And he is putting some strict limits on the procedural changes he would tolerate."
"He is saying: I want to do this under the pay-as-you-go system," Mr. Reischauer says, paraphrasing Mr. Darman's essay. "If you, Congress, refuse to do that, I have a little flexibility. But that flexibility is modest in size."
Mr. Darman probably is just acknowledging the political realities: Cutting the deficit isn't likely to happen given the state of the economy and the political pressures of an election year.
"I think the very reason that it's so hard politically to do anything about it {the deficit} is that the harm that comes from it is so gradual . . . and nobody notices while it's going on," says Mr. Penner of the Urban Institute. "But in 20 years it can make a very substantial difference in our standard of living. In 50 years, it can make the difference beween the U.S. being a great world power or an also-ran like Great Britain."
Mr. Bush's budget does include some proposals that, if embraced by Congress, could reduce the deficit significantly in the future. The plan proposes, for the first time, passing a law that limits growth in federal spending on government benefits -- and forces automatic cuts in those benefit programs (except Social Security) if the cap is breached.
Under his scheme, benefit programs would be permitted to increase somewhat faster than inflation and the growth in the population; currently they go up far faster. "You can't solve the budgetary problem when you have not addressed the so-called forces," Mr. Darman said.
The administraton also proposes changes in accounting for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. and the deposit-insurance programs so that the government's books more accurately reflect the potential costs of these programs, an attempt to learn from the mistakes of the savings-and-loan crisis.
Under the budget law, the accounting changes could be used to create bookkeeping savings that could then finance tax cuts immediately. Mr. Bush relied on only about $6 billion worth of these accounting changes to meet the strictures of the budget law this year; he could have used far more.
After the president's attention-grabbing tax cuts, his proposals for shifting domestic spending are likely to draw the most attention even though many of them will be rejected by Congress. The domestic spending for which Congress must pass annual appropriation bills amounts to $225 billion in cash outlays in Mr. Bush's budget.
Within this total, Mr. Bush would shift money toward spending on children, education, preventive health care, prisons, science and research. Offsetting that, he proposes to terminate or reduce 330 programs. He would, for instance, wipe out the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration as President Reagan tried unsuccessfully to do for years. Mr. Bush would cut money for the Amtrak railroad line.
The budget freeze Mr. Bush announced in his State of the Union speech doesn't apply to cash outlays, but rather to agencies' overall spending authority -- the money Congress puts in their checking accounts for spending this year and in the future.
The freeze allows for big increases in some programs -- Head Start, for one -- and controversial cuts in others -- mass transit, for example, where deep reductions are called for.
The budget also relies on new fees, asset sales and delayed expenditures to come up with short-term savings. Much of the $1.85 billion saved in Interior Department and natural resources accounts, for instance, comes from a plan to lease the Naval Petroleum Reserves, a proposal Congress has rejected in the past.
State and local governments would feel the impact of cuts in labor, health and education programs. And in the same accounts, Mr. Bush proposes to delay the availability of an estimated $3.6 billion in funds until the end of fiscal 1993 and thereby shift the deficit impact into the following fiscal year.
He would also try to cut the federal work force, another Reagan notion that never quite worked. The budget calls for freezing non-military civilian payroll (not counting the deposit-insurance cleanup operation) at 1.17 million workers. But the freeze appears to have been hastily conceived. A table in front of the budget shows the Tennessee Valley Authority losing 2,000 workers, an 8% reduction, but the details in the back show no such decline -- and TVA spokesmen say they believe the latter figures are correct.
Pentagon payrolls would fall. Mr. Bush would lop 40,000 civilian jobs and 122,000 uniformed jobs in fiscal 1993, a decline of 4%.
In the following summary of the president's spending plans, spending proposals for 1993 are compared with 1992 levels approved by Congress. The increases aren't adjusted for inflation or for increases in the population. Spending on any program would have to increase roughly 3.5% to keep pace with inflation -- and many don't.
Agriculture
Agriculture Department spending would fall 4% to $59.4 billion, as cutbacks in farm credit and subsidies would more than offset increases in food assistance and other programs.
The administration proposes boosting spending on food stamps and nutrition programs 1.6% to $34.1 billion to meet growing demand for food aid. Currently, more than 25 million people in the U.S. are receiving food stamps.
Farmers Home Administration outlays, meanwhile, would be slashed 44% to $2.2 billion, reflecting lower farm and rural housing lending and a continued shift from direct loans to guaranteed loans. The administration proposes spending $1.3 billion on programs being consolidated in the Rural Development Administration, which was created by Congress in 1990. Spending on farm-income supports and other subsidies, inflated this year by disaster payments to farmers, would slip 2.5% to $11.6 billion.
Under the presidential "America the Beautiful" initiative, spending for land acquisition and tree planting in national forests would jump 25% to $599 million. At Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan's urging, spending on nutrition education would rise 18% to $321 million, while spending on the development of industrial uses for crops -- such as ethanol from corn -- would rise 18% as well, to $118 million.
The administration plans to save $50 million annually by requiring meat and poultry plants to bear a greater share of the costs of inspecting their products.
The administration also proposes barring any farmer with off-farm income of $100,000 or more from receiving crop subsidies and other farm-program benefits.
Education
Despite strong opposition among Democrats in Congress, the White House is again proposing to use federal money to help send children to private schools.
The budget contains $640 million in budget authority for several "educational choice" initiatives, including a new program of "choice grants" that would put up $500 million in federal funds for vouchers to send children from low-income and moderate-income families to private schools. States would match the federal money. The administration is resurrecting a proposal that would provide $30 million for states and local districts to develop experimental programs offering choices among public and private schools. (Just last week the Senate defeated a similar $30 million proposal.)
The federal grant program for remedial education, known as Chapter 1, would be extended to disadvantaged children who attend private school under choice programs. Chapter 1 budget authority would rise roughly $100 million to $6.8 billion.
Budget authority for the Education Department's discretionary spending would increase by $1.6 billion, or 7%, from fiscal 1992 to $24.3 billion.
To further the administration's America 2000 school reform plan, the budget proposes to begin a program of $1 million grants to start experimental "New American Schools." The administration hopes to eventually have at least one such school in each congressional district.
The budget calls for a 22% increase to $6.6 billion in budget authority for Pell Grants, the main scholarship program for college students. The average grant would rise 54% to $3,700 from $2,400. It also proposes to allow people to take an income-tax deduction for interest paid on federally guaranteed student loans.

Employment
The Labor Department budget involves program changes that mostly indicate level or reduced spending.
Outlays for unemployment benefits would fall 19% to $27.8 billion after climbing 21% in fiscal 1992. The jobless-pay rise this year includes increased regular benefits because of the recession's higher unemployment and two rounds of extended benefits. President Bush and Congress are on the verge of agreeing to the second round, which would provide $2.7 billion for another 13 weeks of benefits. The projected fiscal 1993 drop reflects the administration forecast that the average unemployment rate will fall to 6.5% in calendar 1993 from 6.9% this year.
Job-training and placement programs for dislocated workers, disadvantaged youths and others would be revamped, largely to put more emphasis on the use of local groups run by private industry and to create information and counseling centers in employment offices. Under a "Job Training 2000" initiative, some existing job-training and vocational-education funds would be reprogrammed, but the department's total training budget wouldn't change. Consolidation of operations into fewer ones would produce administrative savings, freeing more money for training outlays.
The budget repeats proposals that have stalled in Congress before. It would combine Job Training Partnership Act summer and youth-training programs into a year-round youth program and create projects to help the most disadvantaged and reduce school dropouts under a new "Youth Opportunity Unlimited" program. Another plan would substitute new programs for one involving training and allowances for workers who lose their jobs because of imports.

Environment and Energy
Cleaning up polluted nuclear weapons plants, upgrading sewage treatment in big cities, and expanding and improving the nation's parks would highlight environmental spending.
The decline in military-production needs allows the Energy Department to cut spending in this area, including the end of nuclear production work at the troubled Rocky Flats facility near Denver. At the same time, spending on cleanup would rise $1 billion to $4.9 billion. Except for a big rise in transportation technologies, research spending on solar and other renewable energy sources would increase slightly. And oil and natural gas programs would win substantial boosts. The department is increasing research spending on global climate change and conservation programs and accelerating plans to purchase alternative-fueled vehicles for the federal fleet. Overall, the department's budget outlays would rise to $16.3 billion from $15.7 billion.
Environmental Protection Agency outlays would increase to $6.2 billion from $5.9 billion, with a healthy share of the rise going to sewage-treatment grants to major cities. Funding for hazardous waste cleanup under the Superfund program and the agency's operating budget would also increase.
Increased spending on parks would finance a big rise in a program to create state parks and recreation facilities under the America the Beautiful program. The budget would also continue a tree-planting initiative, set up a targeted resource-recovery program aimed at specific parks, and increase the number of park rangers. The Interior Department's overall outlays, however, would fall to $6.6 billion from $7.1 billion.

Foreign Aid
State Department and foreign-aid spending would rise to $20.6 billion from $20.1 billion under President Bush's first post-Cold War budget, which reduces security aid and increases funds for the former Soviet Union and United Nations peacekeeping forces. The budget calls for $180 million in spending for humanitarian and technical aid for the former Soviet Union's republics. This would be the first installment of the $645 million in aid Mr. Bush pledged at last week's 47-nation conference to coordinate aid to the republics. A congressional aide said that "as long as it doesn't come out of domestic money, I assume it will go through." The president's budget would accomplish this by essentially keeping a lid on total international-aid spending.
In addition, $350 million in spending is allocated for U.N. peacekeeping forces. Most of this money would be spent on peacekeeping operations in Cambodia and El Salvador, which both recently ended long and bitter civil wars that had been stoked by the Cold War.
Some of the funds for these programs would come from cuts in security assistance to such nations as Pakistan and the Philippines, which were important U.S. allies in the ideological struggle against communism. Overall security assistance would decline 3% to $7.4 billion.

Health
Details of the president's long-awaited health-care reform plan aren't included in his budget. Those proposals are likely to be unveiled next week.
Outlays for the Department of Health and Human Services -- which include Social Security and Medicare payments -- would total $585 billion, about 40% of the entire U.S. budget.
Included in Mr. Bush's budget are substantial increases in several preventive health-care and children's programs. Authorization for spending on childhood immunizations would grow 18% to $1.7 billion. Budget authority for breast and cervical cancer screening would rise 24% to $515 million. As the president announced last week, he is calling for a $600 million, or 27%, increase in budget authority for the Head Start program for disadvantaged preschoolers, more than doubling Head Start funding since 1989.
The budget contains a 21% increase, to $7.6 billion from $6.3 billion, for programs that provide primary care. These include: community and migrant health centers, up 15% to $684 million; health care for homeless people, up $12 million to $68 million; the National Health Service Corps, which provides physicians' services to underserved areas, up 19% to $120 million.
Biomedical research would grow 2% to $10.6 billion. Research on cancer would rise to $2 billion from $1.98 billion; research on heart disease would grow to $772 million from $729 million. AIDS research would grow 4%, to $1.24 billion from $1.19 billion.
In addition, Mr. Bush is calling for spending cuts in programs for immigrants, heating and fuel assistance, and physical education.
The administration is again proposing to reduce the federal subsidy -- and raise the premiums -- for wealthy Medicare beneficiaries. Couples with annual incomes of more than $125,000, and individuals with annual incomes of more than $100,000, would get only 25% of premiums subsidized, instead of 75%. As a result, they would pay $60 more a month. (A similar proposal last year died in Congress.)
Net outlays for Medicare would grow by $10.7 billion to $129.3 billion. The administration would extract $1.5 billion in savings through proposals that affect payments to labs, anesthesiologists, hospitals and home medical equipment suppliers.
-- Hilary Stout
Law Enforcement
Spending on federal law enforcement would rise 9.5% to $15.4 billion. The major beneficiaries would be the federal prison system, prosecutors' offices and federal judicial operations.
Federal prisons, which have been expanding rapidly to handle the larger number of drug criminals receiving mandatory minimum sentences, would receive $2.2 billion, a 16% increase. Spending for prosecutors and judges would rise a combined 12% to $5.6 billion. That total encompasses civil as well as criminal litigation.
The Justice Department, which oversees spending of most of the federal law enforcement budget, would itself receive $10.4 billion, an 11% increase. Attorney General William Barr recently vowed to devote more federal agents to investigating violent street crime, traditionally a state and local concern.
The administration, however, has proposed to spend slightly less for criminal investigations conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and a variety of task forces focusing on organized crime and money-laundering. The combined fiscal 1993 request for these criminal investigative activities is $2.93 billion, down from $2.95 billion in fiscal 1992.
Firearm investigations conducted by the Treasury Department would enjoy a modest increase in funding, as would immigration enforcement programs supervised by both the Treasury and Justice departments.
-- Paul M. Barrett
Poverty and Housing
The administration is offering several modest proposals aimed at low-income people. To combat welfare dependency, states could allow families receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children to keep as much as $10,000 in assets, up from $1,000, without forfeiting welfare benefits. The budget also proposes expediting procedures allowing states to conduct other experiments in welfare reform.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development is slated to receive $28.1 billion, an increase of $4 billion. When the cost of maintaining current programs is taken into account, however, the new figure represents an increase of less than 1%.
Most significant among new HUD proposals is an initiative to allow residents in developments owned by public housing authorities that are designated by HUD as "troubled" to vote to transfer the ownership of the development to a state, city, or nonprofit entity. Termed "perestroika for public housing," the program also would allow HUD to transfer vacant public housing to nonprofit organizations or the tenants themselves. In addition, tenants who receive housing assistance in the form of vouchers would be eligible for the first time to apply the funds toward a home purchase.
The budget halves current funding levels for the HOME program, which provides public housing assistance to states and local governments. But Alfred Delli Bove, deputy housing secretary, said HUD would increase its request to $950 million from $700 million if Congress required state and local governments to supplement federal spending for the program.
The administration also is reviving last year's failed attempt to consolidate several grant programs into a single grant with no strings attached to be awarded to states. Housing programs included in last year's list have been dropped this year at the suggestion of state officials. The new list, which represents $14.7 billion in spending, includes money currently earmarked for education for homeless youth, maternal and child health, drug control, and state welfare administration.
-- Timothy Noah
Science and Space
Outlays on overall research and development would grow 5% to $72.9 billion, while spending for defense research would rise 4% to $38.8 billion.
In civilian research, the administration proposed new initiatives in biotechnology, where budget authority would increase 7% to $4.03 billion; and materials processing, which would increase 10% to $1.8 billion. The administration also proposed a 23% increase for a supercomputer network to $803 million-considerably higher than expected.
The administration continues to push a number of big-science projects, including the superconducting supercollider, which would get a 34% increase in authorized spending to $650 million, and the orbital space station would receive an 11% boost to $2.25 billion.
But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which has long been a favorite of the Bush administration, would receive only a 2% increase in outlays to $14.1 billion. Spending by the National Science Foundation would increase 17% to $2.7 billion.
The administration plans to cancel a $2 billion project to build new rocket boosters for the space shuttle and an $800 million project to launch a robotic spacecraft to tail a comet.
In defense research, the administration plans cuts in nuclear weapons research, development and testing. The Pentagon's budget authority for basic research would increase 3% to $1.2 billion, but budget authority for the military's applied research and development wouldn't keep up with inflation.
-- Bob Davis
Transportation
The Transportation Department would increase spending on aviation and highway programs, while reducing aid for mass transit and rail systems. Overall, department outlays would edge up to $34.5 billion from $33.4 billion this year.
Expenditures by the Federal Aviation Administration would increase to $8.6 billion from the current $7.94 billion, reflecting higher funding for the FAA's massive effort to overhaul the air traffic-control system. The administration also seeks stepped-up research spending on security, safety and communications technology.
An additional 150 air traffic controllers and 25 security staffers would be hired.
Federal Highway Administration outlays would rise to $17.34 billion from $16.15 billion this year, while spending for mass transit would decline to $3.4 billion from $3.75 billion. The administration wants to eliminate operating subsidies to transit systems in cities with more than 500,000 people. The budget proposes higher spending on highways and lower spending on transit than the authorized levels in the 1991 transportation bill. Rail funding also would decline, reflecting reduced assistance to Amtrak.
Congress often has blocked administration efforts to curb rail and transit funding. In addition, because of the new flexibility provided in the transportation bill, the transit budget may be supplemented by as much as $10 billion of highway funds, depending on state and local decisions.
The White House abandoned an earlier proposal to transfer the Ready Reserve Force from the Maritime Administration to the Defense Department.

THE 1992 BUDGET: Blueprint for Wartime -- Bush Backs His Scientific Priorities, Seeks to Lift Overall Outlays 2.6%

Abstract: Noting that government benefits and other mandatory spending now consume 52% of the federal budget, up from 28% in 1962, the president proposes in his budget to shave the growth of these programs by $6.3 billion in 1992 and by $47 billion over the next five years.

But those ceilings don't include the cost of the war, government benefits and the costly cleanup of the savings and loan industry. Within the $212 billion cap on domestic spending, the Bush budget would alter the government's priorities. Targeting what the administration describes as congressional pork-barrel spending, the president proposes saving $4.6 billion by killing 238 domestic programs -- ranging from a $3 million special congressional appropriation for the Children's National Medical Center in Washington to the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration. It also proposes reducing spending on 109 programs to save an additional $8.3 billion.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In his $1.446 trillion budget, President Bush attempts to redirect federal spending towards his priorities while slowing the overall rise in federal outlays.
The increase in overall spending would total only 2.6%, sharply less than last year's 12% rise.
The biggest winner in Mr. Bush's budget for fiscal 1992 would be scientific research and development of all kinds. Such spending would total $8.4 billion more than in the current year, which ends Sept. 30. Two-thirds of the increase would be for defense projects.
Other big winners include children, highways and the war on drugs, all of which Budget Director Richard Darman lumps together as investments in the future. The biggest losers, once again, would be doctors and hospitals who provide health care for the elderly.
Overall defense spending, including Energy Department nuclear-weapons programs, would fall 1.2% below the current year's levels to $295.2 billion. But that is based on an optimistic projection of the cost of the Persian Gulf war.
"Reducing the budget deficit by controlling spending must remain our No. 1 priority," Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said yesterday. "This budget does just that."
Noting that government benefits and other mandatory spending now consume 52% of the federal budget, up from 28% in 1962, the president proposes in his budget to shave the growth of these programs by $6.3 billion in 1992 and by $47 billion over the next five years. Still, these programs would cost $707.5 billion in 1992, up 3.1% from the current year.
More than half of the savings sought by Mr. Bush would come from proposals the president has pushed unsuccessfully in the past to squeeze doctors and hospitals. Changes in various housing programs would save $4.7 billion. No significant changes in agricultural subsidies, which were tackled in last year's farm bill, are proposed.
None of the president's savings proposals are likely to be received warmly on Capitol Hill. Under the new budget rules, Mr. Bush could have used the $6.3 billion he proposes to save in benefit programs to expand other benefit programs or cut taxes. He chose to devote the savings largely to reducing the deficit.
In what Mr. Darman described as an attempt to ignite a debate on government benefits, the president does make several proposals to distribute government benefits "more fairly." His budget would triple Medicare premiums paid by the 600,000 Americans with the highest incomes. It would prohibit the 10,000 individuals with nonfarm income above $125,000 from collecting farm subsidies. It would shift federal grant money toward the poorest students, forcing middle-income students to rely more on government loans. And it would reduce school-lunch subsidies to children from families with incomes more than 85% above the poverty line and use the savings to increase subsidies for poorer children.
The prospective savings aren't big: Tripling the Medicare premium paid by well-off elderly, for instance, would raise only $1.2 billion over five years. But the principle is important, Mr. Darman said. So are the politics; the proposals give the administration a shield with which to defend itself from Democratic charges that it favors the rich.
The budget sticks to the ceilings set last year for defense spending and for domestic spending. But those ceilings don't include the cost of the war, government benefits and the costly cleanup of the savings and loan industry. Within the $212 billion cap on domestic spending, the Bush budget would alter the government's priorities.
"In the domestic discretionary world, you get out of the debate over how big is the pie and into the debate over how to properly split it up," said Robert Grady, one of Mr. Darman's deputies.
Targeting what the administration describes as congressional pork-barrel spending, the president proposes saving $4.6 billion by killing 238 domestic programs -- ranging from a $3 million special congressional appropriation for the Children's National Medical Center in Washington to the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration. It also proposes reducing spending on 109 programs to save an additional $8.3 billion.
But it recommends using all that money, and more, to increase spending above last year's levels on 250 programs -- at a cost of $17.8 billion. Much of that would go to scientific projects from exploring space to seeking a cure for AIDS.
In a budget that breaks little new ground, relatively small initiatives draw attention. The president, for instance, proposes a $171 million program to reduce infant death in 10 big cities; about $32 million of that amount would be drawn from other programs. He seeks a $149 million increase in federal support for high-performance computing. And he calls for a $15 million initiative to protect historic battlefields.
In the following summaries, the figures generally are federal outlays. They are compared with estimated outlays for fiscal 1991, the current fiscal year. With inflation forecast at about 4%, any increase smaller than that amounts to a cut after adjusting for inflation.
Environment
Provisions include funds to carry out the Clean Air Act; increased spending on parks, including Civil War battlefields; and efforts to improve education for American Indians.
The bulk of the 9% rise to $2.3 billion in the Environmental Protection Agency's operating budget would go to clean air. The agency also wants to set up an environmental education office to focus on improving science literacy for elementary and secondary schools. Emphasis also would be placed on studying the health effects of lead exposure, protecting wetlands and coastal areas, and improving food safety. The overall EPA budget, which also includes the Superfund program and construction grants, would increase to about $6.1 billion from $5.9 billion.
Spending would expand and preserve parks, wildlife refuges and other public lands and make them more accessible to disabled people. The battlefield program would include grants to states to improve local protection of sites. The new "Tribal Horizons" program, which would also aim to improve the management of Indian programs and facilitate tribal self-determination, was scaled back from the department's request by the White House budget office. Overall spending on Indian affairs would be essentially unchanged. Interior Department outlays would total $8.7 billion, compared with $8.54 billion in fiscal 1991.
-- Rose Gutfeld
Energy
Efforts to reduce the nation's dependence on oil imports and continued heavy spending on environmental cleanup highlight the Energy Department budget.
Research spending on conservation and renewable energy would increase a hefty 17% to about $478 million in budget authority, after a big rise last year; a big chunk of the funds would go toward solar-energy research, which would rise far less steeply than spending on conservation programs. The department also would expand research to find ways to boost domestic oil output.
Such initiatives, however, are dwarfed by spending at the department's atomic weapons complex, where environmental troubles continue to be a high priority. The department is seeking a $623 million supplemental appropriation for the current fiscal year that includes $340 million for overall environmental management and $283 million earmarked specifically for the Rocky Flats facility in Colorado. Next year, overall spending for environmental restoration and waste management would increase 49% to $3.69 billlion from $2.47 billion.
In a break from previous years, the department is seeking funds for only one new reactor to produce tritium -- a perishable gas that enhances the power of nuclear bombs -- rather than two. A program to use advanced laser technology to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons is being shelved.
Spending for research on global climate change would increase significantly, as would funds for the atom-smashing superconducting supercollider. Total outlays for the agency would increase to $17.33 billion from $15.88 billion.
-- Rose Gutfeld
Space and Science
Spending by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would increase by 9% to $14.72 billion. That reflects a new NASA-Defense Department program to develop a launch system to carry heavy loads into space and slightly higher funding for the space station.
The president also requests a substantial increase for NASA's space-science programs, including astronomy, unmanned planetary exploration and life sciences. Spending would be boosted for the Mission to Planet Earth program, which uses space-based platforms and small satellites to monitor climate changes, ocean surfaces and other data.
The budget seeks to bolster research and development spending. Funding for the National Science Foundation, an important source of grants, would rise substantially, as would spending for the Human Genome Project, which is designed to map the genes in the human body. The budget also proposes a new, $50 million program to provide university researchers with state-of-the-art instrumentation, and making permanent the research and experimentation tax credit.
The administration also requests $149 million for an interagency program on high-performance computing and communications. It aims to sharply improve the nation's computing capability by 1996.
The president also seeks increased spending for biotechnology and for science and mathematics education.
-- Laurie McGinley
Law Enforcement
The president proposes to increase spending for law enforcement by $1.9 billion to $14.5 billion, with emphasis on prison-building and anti-drug programs.
Mr. Bush is requesting $2.6 billion, a 63% increase, for prison expansion and operation. The administration plans to add 5,900 federal prison beds, bringing the total to 65,900.
The president wants Congress to provide $11.7 billion, an 11% increase, for anti-drug programs, including law-enforcement, treatment and prevention efforts, and aid to other countries. Drug-related law enforcement would get its third annual increase; interagency drug task forces would receive a 13% boost, to $363 million, while the Drug Enforcement Administration would receive an 8% increase, to $690 million. The actual level of international aid will depend partly on whether countries such as Peru comply with U.S. conditions.
Most other parts of the justice system would get smaller increases than drug programs. Investigative activities, such as those of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, would receive a 9% increase, to $6.2 billion. The judiciary and prosecutors would get an 11% boost, to $5 billion. The Immigration and Naturalization Service, which is struggling to handle a surge in smuggling and other crimes by aliens, would receive $1.3 billion, an 8% increase.
The Justice Department accounts for more than two-thirds of all law-enforcement spending, or $10 billion, with the Treasury Department and other agencies spending smaller amounts.
-- Paul M. Barrett
Health
The budget seeks to constrain exploding health costs by curbing spending on Medicare, the federal health-insurance program for the elderly and disabled, and devoting more resources to preventive health care.
It increases Medicare premiums for wealthy senior citizens. Individuals with adjusted gross incomes of more than $125,000 -- or over $150,000 for couples -- would pay a monthly premium of about $95 for the part of Medicare that covers physician and outpatient services. Those below the income threshold would pay $31.80 a month.
The plan also crops Medicare $2.85 billion beyond the fiscal 1992 cuts painfully negotiated in last fall's deficit-reduction agreement, and it pares an additional $25.2 billion from the program through fiscal 1996. The five-year deficit-cutting accord stipulated Medicare savings of $42 billion between fiscal 1991 and 1995. Nevertheless, Medicare spending will grow 11.9% to $127.3 billion.
In a further effort to contain costs, the budget includes a proposal to expand enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries in health maintenance organizations.
The budget includes an array of programs to enhance the health of children, including a $100 million increase in funding for Head Start, the social services program for low-income pre-school children, to $2.05 billion and an 18% increase in a nutrition program for low-income women and children to age five, to $2.6 billion. It proposes $171 million to fight infant mortality in 10 cities, and a 19% increase in immunization services to $258 million.
-- Hilary Stout
Transportation
Spending on aviation and highways would increase, but states would have to pick up a bigger portion of the road-building and mass-transit tab.
Total Transportation Department outlays in fiscal year 1992 would be $31.99 billion, up 3.9% from this year.
Outlays for highways would rise to $15.37 billion from $14.44 billion. Slightly higher mass-transit spending would be authorized, although actual transit outlays are projected to decline to $3.52 billion from $4.05 billion.
In a reorganization of surface-transportation programs, the president proposes spending $83 billion on highways and $16.7 billion on mass transit over the next five years. The federal government generally would pay 75% or less of the cost for projects in a 150,000-mile network of major highways, designated the "National Highway System." It would continue to pay 90% for maintenance of interstate highways, though.
A highway block-grant program would consolidate spending involving urban, primary and secondary roads; Washington would pay 60% of the cost of work on such roads, but states could use the money for mass transit.
The federal government would pay 60% or less of the cost of qualifying mass-transit projects, down from 80%.
Outlays for Amtrak, the national passenger railroad, would fall to $410.1 million from $481.4 for 1991. The Federal Aviation Administration's outlays would rise to $7.97 billion from $7.42 billion, and 450 air traffic controllers would be added.
-- Laurie McGinley
Agriculture
Agriculture Department spending, including $15.3 billion for various farm programs, would rise less than 1% to $55.7 billion as increases in food assistance for the needy more than offset cuts in farm credit.
The administration proposes spending $30.2 billion on food stamps and nutrition programs -- a $2 billion increase from this fiscal year -- to meet growing demand for food assistance and to improve the diets of 175,000 additional women, infants and children living in poverty. Farmers Home Administration outlays, meanwhile, would fall 28% to $3.9 billion as the administration lowers lending levels and continues to shift from direct loans to guaranteed loans.
Spending on farm-income supports and other subsidies would rise by $235 million to $11.1 billion. The projected increase would have been considerably larger if Congress hadn't lowered the so-called target prices, the pegs for calculating subsidies for major crops. Spending on federal crop insurance would slip slightly to $859 million under a proposal to cut insurance-premium subsidies to farmers.
In addition, the administration plans to save $50 million annually by having meat and poultry plants bear a greater share of the costs of inspecting their products. The administration also proposes spending 16% more on recreational facilities in the national forests to ease crowding in national parks.
-- Bruce Ingersoll
Employment
Spending would rise for workers who have lost their jobs, but little change is planned for most job training programs.
The first Pentagon-provided domestic "conversion" funds -- $150 million -- would aid workers laid off by defense cutbacks. And a $92 million increase, to $501 million in outlays, is planned to retrain other dislocated workers and help them find jobs.
Outlays would ease 1% to $2.43 billion for basic Job Training Partnership Act youth and young-adult education and training. The administration proposes, as it did a year ago, to combine JTPA summer-youth and youth-training into a year-round youth program. Spending for the separate Job Corps would be boosted 9% to $864 million as construction work expands on two new centers in Kansas and Alabama; funding would be shelved for four other planned centers.
Workers laid off because of the Clean Air Act, enacted late last year, would receive help from $50 million in funds earmarked for a new program. The president proposes -- as he did last year but which stalled in Congress -- to provide $25 million this year for urban and rural projects to help the most disadvantaged youths and prevent school dropouts under a new "Youth Opportunity Unlimited" program.
Funds to pay paperwork costs that states face as unemployment-compensation claims climb sharply would be increased 14% in two steps, during fiscal 1991 and 1992. The budget estimates a 3.1% claims rate in fiscal 1991 and a 3% rate in fiscal 1992. The rate of jobless-pay claims has been 2.8% to 2.9% recently, up from about 2.3% through much of last year.
-- Albert R. Karr
Foreign Aid
State Department and foreign-aid expenditures would grow to $19.6 billion next year from $18.7 billion this year, including an expected rise in aid to Turkey and a new initiative for Latin America.
The president says in his budget that this year's "most critical security need" is support for U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf war, but fiscal austerity will limit the increases. While details are yet to be worked out, a department official says military aid to Turkey could grow 25% to about $625 million, and economic assistance to Ankara may be increased 50% to about $75 million. The budget also cites the needs of Egypt and Israel, but the official says increases aren't likely for those two nations, which already are the largest recipients of U.S. aid.
The budget would allocate $309 million in new spending for a debt-reduction program for Latin America, which was announced last June by President Bush. The goals of the new effort include establishing a new hemispherewide free-trade zone and promoting private investment in Latin America.
A State Department official said that assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe would increase about 8% from last year's roughly $300 million level.

Abstract: PHOTO; DAME [Judith Anderson] Slow Dancing Editor: Baltimore offers a promising business opportunity. We need a place for slow dancing. There doesn't seem to be any place now. There are a few that have occasional slow numbers and the floor fills up then, often more than for the fast dances. We need a place that emphasizes slow dances. Richard Wendell Fogg. Baltimore.

Full text: Millions Wasted
Editor: Roger Simon in a Jan. 8 column wrote about the millions of dollars spent every time Ocean City is devastated by a severe storm.
The worldwide climate change probably will cause more severe storms than ever on the shore in the future. Is it worth wasting taxpayers' money to constantly bail out Ocean City for the benefit of the affluent few?
The bottom line is that there always will be a sea of red ink as long as Mother Nature has her final say in matters of severe storm conditions. It is better to allow the ocean to have the sand and stop spending millions to replace it. Joseph Saffron. Baltimore.
Helmet Law
Editor: I agree with your editorial of Jan. 2 concerning Maryland's helmet law, but Larry Harrison's views, though correct in theory, obviously cannot work in real life. In his Jan. 6 letter to you he states that lawmakers should pass legislation that withholds tax dollars from injured motorcyclists for medical bills.
That's a great idea, but try telling the doctor who is trying to save the life of an injured cycle rider to stop working on that person because he didn't have insurance and we taxpayers aren't paying the bill, either. In real life, that person's life must be saved if at all possible, and we will pay that medical bill through our tax dollars.
Obviously, the only way to try to combat high medical costs is to legislate safety. It worked with the seat belt law, and it will work with the helmet law. Some people may be uncomfortable wearing seat belts, but it has been proven to save lives, thereby keeping our tax dollars lower. The same will be true of the helmet law.
I am all for freedom of choice just as Mr. Harrison is, but a helmet law is for the common good of the people. That's what laws are for, for the collective good of everyone, not just a single individual. Cycle riders should show some social conscience by encouraging a helmet law and stop being so selfish and thinking only of themselves. Every time a rider is involved in an accident while not wearing a helmet, it costs all of us tax dollars. Martin Hartig. Baltimore.
Reform for Health Care
Editor: The battle has begun for the best method of reform of our health-care system. The Health Insurance Association of America, by way of a newspaper advertisement, has arrived at its best method, which is to fix the holes in the present system -- a Band-Aid here, a suture there. By any chance, the insurers wouldn't be thinking of saving themselves by the possibility of losing a most lucrative business?
The people of America demand a complete new system of health care to encompass everyone, and the only true fix is to have a national health-care system. J. Carmel. Baltimore.
Editor: Health care reform is an issue of hot debate at both the national and state level.
On Jan. 9 and 10 the Maryland General Assembly addressed the issue of health care in a two-day summit and on Jan. 14 various national representatives held town meetings on health care reform.
Of the several proposals being discussed, I believe a Canadian style universal health care system is the most cost effective, equitable and far-sighted. Under this system every person has access to full health care coverage. There are no out of pocket payments. Because everyone is covered under the same system there would not be the division between those with private and those with public insurance that there would be under the "play or pay" plan. Individuals would still be free to chose their doctor and hospital while all fees would be paid by the national health insurance. Since funds would be allocated on a state level, costs could be contained and resources more efficiently used than at present.
Health care, like the police and fire departments, should be publicly provided.
A universal health care plan would provide coverage for all, while allowing individuals the freedom to chose the kind of care they think best. Stephen Coleman. Baltimore.
Taxes
Editor: Why should Maryland increase taxes?
Maryland taxes are the fourth highest in the United States. It is obvious that either Maryland has too many unnecessary expensive programs or that the implementation of many programs is inefficient and wasteful.
Some of the waste is mandated by state law. Why, for example, should state law require that construction workers receive higher pay on government projects than on private projects?
There is much that the legislature can do if it would demonstrate more statesmanship and cater less to special interests. Richard K. Eberts. Chestertown.
Farewell, Great Lady
Editor: The death of Dame Judith Anderson, "Great Lady" of the theater at age 93, recalled memories of our luncheon together some 50 years ago on the Galapagos Islands. Ms. Anderson was appearing with a USO show and my commander invited her to dine with my Air Force squadron.
I was seated opposite this wonderful woman and foolishly asked about one of her movie roles, "Lady Scarface."
In a theatrical voice she answered, "Dear boy, why did you bring up that dreadful, dreadful cinema?"
While Judith was not one of Hollywood's glamorous stars, she was the quintessential classical actress with a regal bearing and mesmerizing voice.
Born in Australia in 1898, she was a stage performer by the age of 17 and appeared in "Hamlet" in 1936, "Macbeth" in 1937 and 1941 and "Medea" in 1947 and 1949. Farewell, Lady Macbeth. Kelton Carl Ostrander. Baltimore.

Full text: In the coming year, farm lobbies will be struggling to protect agriculture spending and subsidy programs already targeted by administration and congressional budget-cutters. But the area of greatest concern in 1989 will fall under the jurisdiction of a higher authority.
After the worst drought in 50 years, farmers' eyes will be on the heavens, awaiting rain.
Last summer's drought happened when grain reserves were at record volumes. But this summer, international grain reserves are expected to be at their lowest levels since the years just after World War II. If drought should recur this year, it could mean dire consequences for the world economy, Third World diet and stability in the West, some experts say.
To be sure, late-summer rains and predicted heavy winter snow have eased anxiety in the Farm Belt and Washington. U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) forecasters now anticipate only a moderate rise in food prices and are optimistic about '89 crops.
But two international organizations, the Worldwatch Institute in Washington and the Economist Intelligence Unit in London, warned recently of the danger of another drought in 1989. The effects of global warming, they said, could lead to major shifts in agricultural production patterns, erratic harvests and food shortages.
Worldwatch said an '89 drought would create shockwaves that "could dwarf the economic effects of the oil price hikes of the '70s."
The British group warned that "alternation of years of very high yields boosted by scientific advance and very low yields pulled down by `greenhouse' weather promise a period of prolonged instability in agricultural commodity markets the like of which we have never seen."
At the Agriculture Department in Washington, optimism seems to govern both crop and weather forecasts. Department prognosticators generally agree that rainfall will return to near normal in 1989 across the Midwest. And they say that historical studies show dramatic crop recovery in the year after a drought.
Using those forecasts, department officials predict food price increases in the 3 percent to 5 percent range for 1989, in line with inflation in other sectors of the economy. And they predict that net farm income will rise slightly.
But Worldwatch, an environmental research organization, looked at another set of historical studies and came to a less sanguine conclusion. The '80s have brought the five warmest years on record - 1980, 1981, 1983, 1987 and 1988. In three of those five years, North American agriculture has experienced drought-reduced harvests. Each drought has been more severe, paralleling the rise in global temperature.
Global warming, or the "greenhouse effect," is caused by a buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Unless there is international agreement to reduce the use of fossil fuels and halt deforestation and other practices that contribute to warming, "food security could replace military security as the principal preoccupation of many governments," says the Worldwatch report, written by Lester R. Brown and John E. Young.
The institute is particularly concerned about the corn crop, which accounts for two-thirds of U.S. grain production. Brown and Young say it may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. But the USDA is calling the drought a thing of the past and predicting a rebound in corn production this year.
For consumers, the USDA is predicting bargains in the poultry section, where experts expect prices to go down in response to increased output by turkey and chicken producers. Fresh vegetables, rather than canned or frozen ones, are likely to be the best bargains for consumers in 1989, according to a department food economist. Cereals, fats, oils and baked goods will rise in prices because of the 1988 drought.
Egg prices are likely to soar as much as 20 percent, as production slackens in response to a decline in demand in recent years.
Record meat supplies are holding down the overall food-price increase, said James Donald, chairman of the USDA's World Outlook Board. Beef prices will be up slightly in 1989 as the U.S. cattle inventory continues to decline to the lowest levels since 1961. Pork prices will remain low through early 1989 but may rise later in the year as production slackens.
In preparing President Reagan's final budget proposal, the $50 billion USDA outlay was targeted for especially heavy cuts, according to recent reports from the Office of Management and Budget. The Bush administration is not obligated to follow Reagan's recommended trims, but insiders say the Reagan budget is an indication of where cuts are likely.
Bush's nominee for agriculture secretary, Clayton Yeutter, is described by Bush as a man who "knows how to take a sharp knife to a lot of budgetary things." But Bush pledged not to "balance the budget on the backs of farmers."
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng told reporters at the Outlook Conference in Washington last month that he expected $3 billion to be cut next year from farm subsidy programs. The General Accounting Office recommended significant reductions in farm insurance programs. The Farmers Home Administration is expected to reduce its budget next year through tightened lending policies.
Through the budget battle, farm-state lawmakers will have their eye on the nation's farm legislation, which expires in 1990. Some, like Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., recommend moving toward a more free-market approach to agriculture, gradually phasing out export subsidies and crop set-aside programs. Yeutter, currently U.S. trade representative, is expected to be a strong ally in the push to a stronger free-market orientation.
While Yeutter is well-regarded by farm-state legislators, he can expect opposition to subsidy spending cuts.
When trade negotiations led by Yeutter in Montreal failed to produce international agreement to cut subsidies earlier this month, some Congress members, such as Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kansas, argued for strengthening U.S. export subsidy programs.
The battle over agriculture and trade policy is likely to be so hot in 1989 that insiders predict congressional agriculture committees will vote to extend the current farm bill and delay consideration of the next one until after the 1990 election.
Crop outlook for 1989
Corn/ This crop, which accounts for two-thirds of U.S. grain production, is a source of concern to the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research organization in Washington. Summer heat waves can reduce corn yields if they occur during the 10-day pollination period in July. But at the Agriculture Department's annual Outlook Conference, the drought was largely treated as an event of the past. James Donald, chairman of the department's World Outlook Board, predicted that corn production will "rebound strongly in 1989-90, spurred by higher prices and reduced acreage reduction requirements." Corn exports are expected to be up more than 2 percent from 1987-88.
Soybeans/ Soybean prices are expected to "show significant gains," in 1989, according to the USDA. Higher prices and greater demand for oilseeds are expected to stimulate production around the globe.
Wheat/ The outlook for world wheat markets looks strong this year and offers U.S. producers a chance to make gains, according to government analysts. "If the recent upward trend in yields continues, the world should easily harvest a 1989 wheat crop in excess of 500 million metric tons," said USDA economist Bruce Weber. "How favorable the growing season is will dictate how close the crop comes to the record 530 million harvest of 1986."
Dairy/ Under existing dairy price supports, the nation's farmers produce much more milk than consumers demand, according to a December report by the General Accounting Office. As a result the cost of maintaining artificially high milk prices has cost the government dearly, from $247 million in 1979 to $1.2 billion in 1987. Experts predict even greater milk production in coming years because of new technology and the introduction of techniques that increase the amount of milk cows can produce. In 1987-88 milk production was up 2.3 percent and, according to the USDA's James Donald, "production in the next year is expected to show little change." The expense of dairy price support payments is likely to become an issue in the next budget-conscious Congress.
Sugar/ Drought and disease will take a toll on production in this heavily regulated industry. William Cromarty, an industry expert, said domestic production could decline 13 percent in 1989. Increased imports will compensate for the decline, however, and supply will meet demand.

Abstract: Genetic engineering. Minnesota is among eight states scheduled for early experimentation with gene material for agricultural purposes. . . . Chances of progress and risk of environmental damage remain a mystery. . . . Gene advances could help, with micro-organisms that clean up toxic waste and superefficient plants that do not need as many pesticides and fertilizers, but could also induce growth of "superweeds" and "superbugs" or the takeover of environmental niches by engineered organisms. Regional centers. Outside the Twin Cities, Minnesota will increasingly be dominated by about 12 cities, as the state's smallest towns continue to lose population and commerce. . . . Medical centers in these regional capitals, for instance, are likely to replace the small local hospital. . . . In 1987, 13 cities with 18 percent of the nonmetro Minnesota population shared 38 percent of its sales. . . . Between 1983 and 1988, employment in Minnesota counties with major retail centers grew by 11 percent, while in other counties employment fell by 4 percent. . . . Cities such as Moorhead and Mankato will continue to thrive and the Twin Cities' dominance will grow even stronger. Minority population growth. The nonwhite population of Minnesota is less than 4 percent, yet it accounted for about a third of the total population growth between 1980 and 1985. . . . Asians increased 50 percent, blacks by 35 percent, Hispanics by 20 percent, and American Indians by 15 percent. . . . School desegregation and political influence will be affected. . . . Possible problems exist in overcoming language barriers and the potential for increased racial conflict. . . . Increased ethnic diversity in Minnesota will open new opportunities and markets, but unless those groups' higher poverty rates and lower educational attainment rates are altered, state and local governments will face "special challenges."

Full text: The Minnesota Planning Agency has prepared a document that might well be called "Nine for the Nineties," a list of issues likely to dominate public debate in Minnesota through the next decade.
Many of these predicted problems and trends will be influenced by the post-World War II population explosion known as the baby boom. Most of those boomers, who seem destined to occupy center stage in U.S. society throughout their lives, will be well into their 40s by the end of the current decade.
Any such list, of course, is entirely speculative, and unexpected things will happen. Who, for instance, in 1979 could have predicted the AIDS epidemic or the dramatic changes in the Midwestern farm economy?
Nonetheless, here are paraphrased summaries of what the agency predicts will be the hottest topics in Minnesota and the nation during the 1990s:
Health insurance and access to health care. At least 340,000 Minnesotans, or 8 percent of the population, are not covered by health insurance. . . . The problem might be larger than any individual state can handle. . . . Companies that must compete internationally are at a competitive disadvantage with businesses in other countries that have national health insurance. . . . Physicians are growing disillusioned with a system that limits care but intensifies liability.
Educational governance. Minnesota's long tradition of local government control of public schools will be re-examined. . . . A battle is shaping up between those who want the state to assume greater control (statewide testing and standards) and those who favor increased decentralization ("chartered" schools, teacher-run schools). . . . Reforms in the 1980s focused on raising standards, a return to basics and higher teacher pay. . . . A "second wave" of school reform is aimed not only at improving the performance of low achievers but also "blowing the top out" on overall performance.
Regional centers. Outside the Twin Cities, Minnesota will increasingly be dominated by about 12 cities, as the state's smallest towns continue to lose population and commerce. . . . Medical centers in these regional capitals, for instance, are likely to replace the small local hospital. . . . In 1987, 13 cities with 18 percent of the nonmetro Minnesota population shared 38 percent of its sales. . . . Between 1983 and 1988, employment in Minnesota counties with major retail centers grew by 11 percent, while in other counties employment fell by 4 percent. . . . Cities such as Moorhead and Mankato will continue to thrive and the Twin Cities' dominance will grow even stronger.
Work force training (and retraining). Watch for the unique phenomenon of a decline in entry-level workers and a labor shortage in some areas, as the baby boom ages and the "baby bust" matures. . . . The economy will place greater reliance on the older worker, and those old dogs will have to learn more new tricks. . . . Technological advances will require retraining for an estimated 75 percent of the national work force. . . . Higher education systems will be under intense pressure to adapt.
Minority population growth. The nonwhite population of Minnesota is less than 4 percent, yet it accounted for about a third of the total population growth between 1980 and 1985. . . . Asians increased 50 percent, blacks by 35 percent, Hispanics by 20 percent, and American Indians by 15 percent. . . . School desegregation and political influence will be affected. . . . Possible problems exist in overcoming language barriers and the potential for increased racial conflict. . . . Increased ethnic diversity in Minnesota will open new opportunities and markets, but unless those groups' higher poverty rates and lower educational attainment rates are altered, state and local governments will face "special challenges."
Children in society. More working mothers and the need for child care are only part of the story. . . . Look to the care of children (some lavished with attention and using computers at an early age, others neglected and abused) as the most sensitive indicator of the emergence of a two-tiered society. . . . Drug abuse has led to the abuse and neglect of some children. . . . Needed are strategies to strengthen families. . . . Yet a smaller percentage of the population will have children, producing a shrinking constituency for public programs.
Solid-waste management and recycling. If garbage production continues at current rates, 40 percent of Minnesota's landfill capacity could be closed by 1993. . . . Some 50 landfills are on the state "superfund" cleanup list. . . . The Twin Cities area recycles about 10 percent of its waste, and that rate will have to be improved.
Genetic engineering. Minnesota is among eight states scheduled for early experimentation with gene material for agricultural purposes. . . . Chances of progress and risk of environmental damage remain a mystery. . . . Gene advances could help, with micro-organisms that clean up toxic waste and superefficient plants that do not need as many pesticides and fertilizers, but could also induce growth of "superweeds" and "superbugs" or the takeover of environmental niches by engineered organisms.
Water quality. Great progress has been made in controlling pollution from municipal waste and industrial plants. . . . But pesticides have been found in nearly 40 percent of the state's private wells. . . . Agriculture contamination and other "non-point" pollution, the hardest kind to control, account for most of today's problems. . . . At least 300,000 abandoned wells may be giving pollutants direct access to ground water.
Continuing issues. Among the familiar but serviceable issues likely to linger through the turn of the century: global climate change, liability insurance, homelessness, corporate restructuring, division of responsibilities between state and local governments, urban transportation, a growing elderly population, prisons, farm structure, AIDS, indoor air quality (radon), and international trade.

FINDING THE PROPER PLACE, AND PRICE, FOR ARSENALS: [TEXT]

Abstract: ACKNOWLEDGING mounting concern about the East-West nuclear weapons buildup in Europe, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. last week reaffirmed that the Administration is ''serious'' about arms-control talks with the Soviet Union scheduled to start in Geneva on Nov. 30. The peace demonstrations do ''not mean that our European allies are going 'neutral,' '' he also told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ''The invasion of neutral Afghanistan and the violation of neutral Sweden's territory by a Soviet submarine should dispel the illusion that neutrality confers immunity.'' The fact that the base from which we start is so prosperous by any previous historical standards should give the political leadership of our countries a chance to sustain cohesion and morale. The leadership elites can do so, in my judgment, only if they recognize that social and economic justice is not incompatible with national security and with continued economic growth. They also need to recognize...that it is foolish to think of arms control negotiations and agreements as a trap. Our overall security position can be improved by them, and war made less likely. The ABM and SALT II treaties have, in my judgment, had this effect. Harold Brown Secretary of Defense in Carter Administration Examining Anti-Americanism BRUSSELS We are not even living in a world governed by reason. Anybody who calls upon ''reasonable men'' to disarm is establishing the rule of the unreasonable. That is not politics; that is suicide from the fear of death. And so until ''peace can be a child of reason, it must remain the daughter of terror,'' as Churchill said. Anti-Americanism does not begin only when national or social personalities pronounce derogatory judgment upon the New World, (on) the present American Administration, or individual representatives belonging to it, or use sheer unbelievable epithets to describe the treatment of the European allies by the leading power in the alliance, such as ''helots,'' ''askaris,'' or ''slaves.'' Anti-Americanism is expressed even - and this is the nucleus of the problem in the present debate - by placing America and the Soviet Union at a single level.

Full text: ACKNOWLEDGING mounting concern about the East-West nuclear weapons buildup in Europe, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. last week reaffirmed that the Administration is ''serious'' about arms-control talks with the Soviet Union scheduled to start in Geneva on Nov. 30. The peace demonstrations do ''not mean that our European allies are going 'neutral,' '' he also told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ''The invasion of neutral Afghanistan and the violation of neutral Sweden's territory by a Soviet submarine should dispel the illusion that neutrality confers immunity.''
These and related concerns were discussed by a panel of specialists who met last month in the ornate Egmont Palace in Brussels under auspices of the Atlantic Institute, a 20-year-old private organization that promotes cooperation in the West.
In Paris meanwhile, another group of experts, including one from the Soviet Union who asked not to be identified, examined the economic consequences of weapons spending at a conference organized by the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues. The commission is headed by former Prime Minister Olof Palme of Sweden. Excerpts from their presentations follow. 'Artificial' Arguments BRUSSELS Any discussion of East-West relations in the contemporary setting must begin with the observation that policy toward the East is probably subject to greater diversity in the Western alliance than at any time in the 32 years since NATO was formed.
Some of the debates, both within and among allied countries, seem somewhat artificial. For example, the Reagan Administration, despite some extreme statements about Soviet complicity in originating third world strife, is well aware of the indigenous and regional sources of instability, and American policies have sought to address these. By the same token, whatever the precise Soviet role in the origins of third world instabilities (and) conflicts, there is ample evidence that Moscow is prepared to exploit them for its own purposes. Consequently, Western policies must be prepared to cope with indigenous and regional sources of conflict as well as with Soviet endeavors to exacerbate and exploit them.
Even so, one must enter the caution that policies exclusively designed to reduce or remove Soviet ''opportunities'' for expanding influence in the third world may well be insufficient: Many of the demands, grievances and needs voiced in the third world will not be met, or fully met, by even the most generous and sympathetic Western policies and there may thus still remain ample scope for Soviet involvement. The problem of how to deal with various forms of Soviet activism will not disappear.
There also seems little point in arguments about whether the problems of the third world are essentially more nonmilitary than military and in the frequently voiced criticism that American policy overemphasizes the military aspects. Experience has shown that whenever the U.S.S.R. does involve itself in third world problems its policy does have strong military components. Moreover, in recent years, such Soviet involvement has frequently been designed to serve purely Soviet military ends (although also catering to the needs and demands of the ''inviting'' authorities). Thus, in Angola, the Soviets use local facilities for their own navy and air force; the same has been the case in Somalia and, since the Soviet expulsion, in Ethiopia.
Indeed, it is Soviet policy that seeks to draw third world problems into an East-West context and to exploit them for geopolitical gain. Time and again Soviet spokesmen at all levels insist that Soviet support for ''national liberation'' cannot be subsumed under notions of East-West detente. Helmut Sonnenfeldt Guest scholar, Brookings Institution Third World Costs PARIS Compared to their country's total population, very few Americans or Russians have been military casualties since 1945. By contrast, defense spending in many parts of the third world buys very little security at all. Even when only the wars that made the headlines in the Western press are considered, the list during the 1970's in the third world is long - countries in Indochina, the Indian subcontinent, the Fertile Crescent, the Horn of Africa, Southern Africa, West Africa, and Central America engaged in extensive internal and external hostilities.
The sequelae in many cases were disastrous. For example, famine is a process of cumulative social and economic disruption in a population at the subsistence margin that is set off by an external shock. Kampuchea (Cambodia), Bangladesh, Uganda, Nigeria and other countries suffered devastating famines - equivalent in economic terms to the loss of several years' growth in Gross National Product - that were the direct results of wars. If this trend of the last decade continues, the 1980's arms effort in parts of the third world may bring all economic progress to a devastating halt.
When wars do not erupt, the decreasing returns case is still valid, but the argument is more complex. It is simplest to proceed step by step - first taking up the complications in a single country, and later bringing in capital flows and international trade.
Peru is a sobering example, after its large arms imports and extensive commercial bank loans of the early 1970's. The succession of highly contractionary stabilization policies imposed upon that country since 1977 shows how costly in the long run a rapid increase in arms imports can be. In Africa, the share of arms in total imports rose from 1.3 percent to 9.3 percent between 1969 and 1978. Unless they somehow turn these foreign exchange outlays into an export push, some sub-Saharan nations may be forced along the path of Peru.
The moral from this discussion is that arms spending has strong effects on the evolution of the economy, mostly of an unfavorable sort. Lance J. Taylor Professor of nutritional economics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Unpleasant Options PARIS The United States is, at the moment, alone among the Western allies in having a major military buildup. This creates a major economic problem in the U.S. Its technology industries will be facing problems not faced by their competitors.
Logically there are only three options for the United States. 1) Simply accept the fact that civilian high technology industries will lose some of their world and American markets. 2) Force our military allies but economic competitors to engage in similar military buildup so that their firms face the same conditions as American firms. 3) Slow down the acceleration in military procurement. I would predict that, within a relatively short period of time, American public opinion will be demanding that the Reagan Administration accomplish the second option or accept the third option. This is particularly true since much of the buildup is targeted on areas (protecting Middle Eastern oil supplies) that are of more direct relevance to our allies than they are to us.
Essentially the President is proposing to drive his economic car with one foot on the fiscal accelerator and the other on the monetary brake. The result is apt to be high interest rates with modest amounts of growth.
Thus the U.S. is apt to be suffering some supply-side inflation and high interest rates. And given the U.S. role in the world economy, we will be exporting both of these items to the rest of the world.
The case for and against more military spending must be based on foreign policy and military factors. Economics plays a very subsidiary role. The Reagan military policies lead to some very adverse economic consequences, but most of those are avoidable consequences if a different set of economic policies accompanied the military build-up. Personally, I oppose the Reagan policies because I do not agree with his interpretation of the threat or his military strategy for countering the threat, but I do not think you can base your opposition upon economic foundations. Lester C. Thurow Professor of management and economics, Sloan School of Management, M.I.T. Hindering Central Planning PARIS Evaluating negative effects of the arms race, we should also keep in mind the problem of the so-called ''lost opportunities,'' i.e. those economic benefits which would accrue from utilizing human, financial and material resources for productive purposes, if these resources had not been diverted to the military sphere. Naturally, this is not a simple question because it concerns the opportunities which failed to materialize, and because of this it is extremely difficult to quantify them.
It is quite clear though that the scale of the ''lost opportunities'' immeasurably increases as labor productivity grows, as resource utilization efficiency increases, as achievements of science and technology are implemented, etc.
Thus, the real economic expenses incurred by the arms race consist not only in that extremely valuable and very often nonrenewable resources are diverted; in addition, we have to take into account those potential economic benefits which could accrue from rational and productive utilization of these resources.
It is also important to note that negative economic effects of the arms race are not restricted by the frontiers of a few nations on the globe. They concern the entire international community.
Diversion of resources for military preparations is an obstacle on the way to solving not only the most acute internal socioeconomic problems in many countries, but to solving global problems as well - backwardness, poverty, disease, illiteracy, food and nutrition for the growing population of the earth, discovery and practical use of new sources of energy, protection of the environment, etc.
Military preparations damage considerably the economic interests of many countries also because they raise obstacles on the way to full utilization of advantages which may bring with it the international division of labor; military preparations disturb the normal course of state-to-state economic relations, create artificial barriers for development of trade and scientific and technical cooperation between countries.
Managing a centrally planned economy means that certain proportions, which are the subject of advanced planning every five years, are kept between individual branches and factors of production. Crisis situations of all kinds occurring abroad, international conflicts whipping up the arms race require that preset priorities be changed, make it necessary to look for additional resources, hinder normal performance of a centrally planned economic mechanism. A Soviet expert Can the Climate Change? BRUSSELS There is a growing frustration and anger caused by the lack of progress in efforts to curb the accumulation of nuclear arms taking hold in West European society. Unless public confidence can be restored in the feasibility of arms control and the credibility of NATO's commitment to pursue it, there is a serious danger that social consensus behind prudent defense policies may disintegrate, leading to polarized social strife and a general crisis in the relationship between state and society in Europe. It seems doubtful whether international stability is attainable in a climate of instability at the national level about the proper approach to security. In such times, temptations may arise, and they should be resisted, to reconstitute the Atlantic Alliance on conservative grounds. Such attempts could make the alliance, as such, a matter of rather intense domestic controversy in West European society. Political forces of the center and left-of-center could be removed from the resulting narrowed consensus.
Arms control has played the important role of integrating such vital forces into a broad consensus behind the Western Alliance. Here it is not a question of making defense policy a hostage to arms control, but rather of creating the requisite conditions for a stable defense policy. The public is right in the perception that the present trends are dangerous and that they should be broken. It is the role of statecraft to break the trends in a manner which will enhance security and political order and not make security the hostage of rampant unilateralism. The pursuit of arms control must not be a blind pursuit of elusive goals, but rather an attempt to make that possible which is necessary. That, in the final analysis, is the essence of political leadership.
In addition to formal negotiations with a view to concluding formal agreements on limitations on hardware and deployments, it may prove useful to conduct a dialogue on nuclear doctrine between the two superpowers. The aim of such a dialogue would not be doctrinal convergence as much as clarification and explication. Management of nuclear deterrence involves a series of dilemmas. Their resolution may breed uncertainty and fear.
No system of deterrence can be made foolproof in the sense of containing absolute assurance against failure. Hence, the nuclear powers take out some insurance against the event that deterrence were somehow to fail. Such insurance could involve capabilities and procedures for limiting action and war termination. However, insurance of this kind could generate fears of a war-fighting strategy for war-winning objectives. The scope and modulation of the measures involved would be important for the assessment and perceptions of their implications. A Soviet-American dialogue could provide a forum for discussing alternative approaches to the management of nuclear deterrence with a view to minimizing tension, competition and misconception. Johan J. Holst State Secretary, Norwegian Foreign Ministry Consider Moscow's Problems BRUSSELS We face a variety of developments - military, political, economic - in the West, in the Soviet bloc, and in the third world, that pose grave dilemmas to the industrialized democracies. We are in disarray. That we are perhaps less so than others - specifically than our adversaries - needs to be remembered.
The Soviets, both as I see it and as some (though not all) of their own analysis and behavior suggest, are thus left with a real question as to whether they could overrun Western Europe quickly by conventional means, and with grave doubts as to the prudence of such a gamble, given the substantial chance of escalation to nuclear war and the defects in the staying power of the Warsaw Pact forces.
In the Far East, major Soviet ground and air force buildups, along with an expansion of the Soviet Pacific fleet, have probably substantially outweighed U.S and Japanese additions to military power. At the same time, similar uncertainties must exist in Soviet planning about the consequences of a Soviet attack in the Far East.
Moreover, both in Europe and in Asia, the trends in the military balance favorable to the Soviet Union must be considered in the context of Soviet (and sadly, of allied) political difficulties. In the West, the reliability of all the Warsaw Pact forces is brought into relief by the Soviet political difficulties in Poland. But these Soviet problems of a loosening of Warsaw Pact ties must also be examined in the light of a degree of loosening of resolve, will and cohesion of which there is some evidence in NATO as well.
In the Far East, the Soviet gains in relative military power have been more than offset by the deterioration in the Soviet political position. This includes the development of an implacable (and, by Peoples Republic of China declaration, eternal) Chinese hostility toward the Soviet Union; much closer relations between the U.S. and China; and the major deterioration in relations between Japan and the Soviet Union deriving in large measure from the Soviet occupation of the northern territories. What undoubtedly seems to the Soviets to be at least an incipient alliance among the U.S., China and Japan must rank as a major disaster in Soviet security policy. This highlights Soviet effectiveness in creating, by their actions, but not by their design, coalitions unfriendly to the U.S.S.R.
Neither strategic war nor conventional war between the Soviet Union and the industrialized democracies ranks as one of the more probable threats to security. However, the military balance and perceptions of it are a major factor in political behavior and, in periods of crisis, may well do so decisively. It is for that reason that the industrialized democracies must pay major attention to the military balance, and act to reverse the adverse trends of much of the past 15 years. The U.S. began to do so five years ago and, even in the face of difficult economic circumstances, the new Administration plans to speed up those actions in accordance with what is generally perceived as a popular mandate to do so.
The fact that the base from which we start is so prosperous by any previous historical standards should give the political leadership of our countries a chance to sustain cohesion and morale. The leadership elites can do so, in my judgment, only if they recognize that social and economic justice is not incompatible with national security and with continued economic growth. They also need to recognize...that it is foolish to think of arms control negotiations and agreements as a trap. Our overall security position can be improved by them, and war made less likely. The ABM and SALT II treaties have, in my judgment, had this effect. Harold Brown Secretary of Defense in Carter Administration Examining Anti-Americanism BRUSSELS We are not even living in a world governed by reason. Anybody who calls upon ''reasonable men'' to disarm is establishing the rule of the unreasonable. That is not politics; that is suicide from the fear of death. And so until ''peace can be a child of reason, it must remain the daughter of terror,'' as Churchill said.
Anti-Americanism in Europe is bound to pave the way in the United States for anti-Europeanism and can lead to American isolationism - this time not of America's own choice, but forced upon her by the Europeans. And without the United States, a policy of preventing war by deterrence based upon the balance of forces is impossible either in or for Europe, so that security cannot be guaranteed.
But anti-Americanism does not begin only when national or social personalities pronounce derogatory judgment upon the New World, (on) the present American Administration, or individual representatives belonging to it, or use sheer unbelievable epithets to describe the treatment of the European allies by the leading power in the alliance, such as ''helots,'' ''askaris,'' or ''slaves.'' Anti-Americanism is expressed even - and this is the nucleus of the problem in the present debate - by placing America and the Soviet Union at a single level.
''Rather red than dead'' is a pseudo-alternative. A war prevention policy which is effective by reason of its credibility offers the assurance that there is no necessity to be either red or dead. Thirty years of practicing a policy of military balance are perhaps no proof that that concept has always been and still is the right one, but they are pretty good circumstancial evidence.
Security policy must be restored to natural priority in the national catalogues of tasks to be accomplished. True, security isn't everything. But without security nothing is anything. The greatest social achievement of a government is still to keep its citizens alive and free. We cannot therefore address our efforts at short notice to this clamoring minority; they must reach the silent majority. Theirs is the support we need if we are to solve the great and inevitable problems of Western security in the 1980's. Manfred Worner Chairman, Defense Committee, West German Bundestag

The Greenhouse Effect? Real Enough.: [Editorial]

Abstract: A fierce drought is shriveling crops from Texas to North Dakota and has shrunk the Mississippi to its lowest levels on record. Dry years are part of nature's cycle. Still, it's time to take seriously another possible influence - the warming of the atmosphere by waste gases from a century of industrial activity. Whether or not the feared greenhouse effect is real, there are several preventive measures worth taking in their own right. According to computer simulations of the world's climate, there should be more rain in a greenhouse-heated globe. The rain falls in different places: more at the poles and the equator, less in the mid-latitudes. The drought in the Middle West falls in with these projections. But it stops far short of proving that the greenhouse effect has begun. ''As far as we can tell, this is a tough summer well within the normal range of variability,'' says Donald Gilman, the Weather Service's long-range forecaster.

Still, it's time to take seriously another possible influence - the warming of the atmosphere by waste gases from a century of industrial activity.
A fierce drought is shriveling crops from Texas to North Dakota and has shrunk the Mississippi to its lowest levels on record. Dry years are part of nature's cycle. Still, it's time to take seriously another possible influence - the warming of the atmosphere by waste gases from a century of industrial activity. Whether or not the feared greenhouse effect is real, there are several preventive measures worth taking in their own right.
The greenhouse theory holds that certain waste gases let in sunlight but trap heat, which otherwise would escape into space. Carbon dioxide has been steadily building up through the burning of coal and oil - and because forests, which absorb the gas, are fast being destroyed. There is no clear proof that the gases have yet begun to warm the atmosphere. But there's circumstantial evidence, and some experts think it is getting stronger.
For example, four of the last eight years - 1980, 1981, 1983 and 1987 - have been the warmest since measurements of global surface temperatures began a century ago, and 1988 may be another record hot year. Still, there have been hot spells before, followed by a cooling.
According to computer simulations of the world's climate, there should be more rain in a greenhouse-heated globe. The rain falls in different places: more at the poles and the equator, less in the mid-latitudes. The drought in the Middle West falls in with these projections. But it stops far short of proving that the greenhouse effect has begun. ''As far as we can tell, this is a tough summer well within the normal range of variability,'' says Donald Gilman, the Weather Service's long-range forecaster.
That's the nub of the problem: It's hard to identify a small, gradual sign of global warming amid wide natural fluctuations in climate. Even over the long term, the evidence is merely indicative. The world has warmed half a degree centigrade over the last century. But the warming is less than some computer models predict, forcing defenders of the greenhouse theory to argue that the extra heat is disappearing into the oceans.
With the greenhouse effect still uncertain, why take preventive steps, especially since the main one, burning less coal, would be enormously expensive? One answer is that it it may take years to acquire positive proof of greenhouse-induced climate change, and the longer society waits, the larger a warming it will have to adapt to if the greenhouse theory turns out to be valid. Even a small warming could produce violent changes in climate. At worst, the Gulf Stream might shift course, failing to warm Europe. Sea level could rise 20 feet if the West Antarctic Ice Cap melts, flooding coastal cities from New York to New Orleans.
Several measures to slow the greenhouse warming are worth taking for other reasons: Cut production of freons, chemicals used as solvents and refrigerants. Important greenhouse gases, they destroy the life-protecting ozone layer. Protect tropical forests, which not only absorb carbon dioxide but also nourish a rich variety of animal and plant life. Encourage conservation of energy and use of natural gas, which produces half as much carbon dioxide as does coal. Develop cheaper, safer nuclear power; nuclear plants produce no carbon dioxide or acid rain.
Many climatologists expect that the greenhouse theory will eventually prove true, but fear to issue alarmist warnings ahead of time. Their caution is justified. But there's an ample case for taking these initial preventive measures when the cost of such insurance is so low and the discomforts of abrupt climate change, as the drought demonstrates, so high.

Abstract: ''This area has been given little thought,'' said Wallace S. Broecker, professor of geochemistry at Columbia University. ''At a minimum, a rational society needs some sort of insurance policy on how to maintain a habitable planet.'' ''The point is not that the strategy is necessarily a wise one, but, rather, that purposeful global climate modification lies within our grasp,'' Dr. Broecker wrote in his book, ''How to Build a Habitable Planet.'' He added: ''One hundred years from now the temptation to take such action may be high.'' Chips on the Oceans ''It's reasonable to ask if there's anything to do to repair the damage,'' said said Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist at the Environmental Defense Fund, based in New York. ''But the effort and scale of some of these things is huge. It's probably cheaper in the long run to rely on prevention rather than unusual cures.''

Full text: LEAD: AS scientists and public officials urge painful, expensive measures to prevent climate change -reducing energy use, developing alternative sources of power, curbing production of destructive pollutants - a breed of visionaries is dreaming of more direct, if seemingly fantastic, countermeasures.
AS scientists and public officials urge painful, expensive measures to prevent climate change -reducing energy use, developing alternative sources of power, curbing production of destructive pollutants - a breed of visionaries is dreaming of more direct, if seemingly fantastic, countermeasures.
These experts are exploring extraordinary ways to combat pollution in the earth's atmosphere and its threat of climatic upheaval. They envision environmental wars fought with lasers that blast apart harmful chemicals, satellites that beam safe energy to earth, microoorganisms that soak up pollutants and chemical-releasing airships that replace critical elements being removed from the earth's atmosphere.
One aim is to counter the gases that produce the greenhouse effect, which is thought to be gradually warming the earth, threatening to raise oceans and damage agricultural production. Another is to halt the breakdown of the ozone layer, which blocks the sun's ultraviolet rays.
Work on futuristic cures for these pollution problems started in the 1970's and has accelerated in the 1980's as concern has grown about potential damage to the atmosphere. Experts involved in the research stress that the ideas are often untested and in some cases could be risky. Most experts agree that for now, preventing the release of harmful gases into the sky deserves far higher priority than efforts to fix a damaged atmosphere.
Yet the surge of creative thinking, they add, could ultimately play an important role in the battle to stabilize the earth's changing weather, especially if conditions take a dramatic turn for the worse.
''Some of this is mighty speculative,'' said Thomas H. Stix, a Princeton University physicist. ''But if we have a couple of summers like we just had, people are going to get pretty panicky over what we should do about it.''
Key questions are whether the techniques are safe and feasible, and, if so, whether the potentially huge cost of carrying them out would be economically justified. In addition, some experts warn that large-scale intervention in the earth's delicate and poorly understood cycles of climatic chemistry could trigger unwanted side effects.
Backers of the research say its value often lies not so much in sparking concrete plans as in inspiring thought about how, ultimately, to deal with climate problems.
''This area has been given little thought,'' said Wallace S. Broecker, professor of geochemistry at Columbia University. ''At a minimum, a rational society needs some sort of insurance policy on how to maintain a habitable planet.''
One futuristic idea is to use giant lasers atop mountains to scrub harmful chemicals from the earth's atmosphere, a concept pioneered by Dr. Stix at Princeton. He calls it ''atmospheric processing.'' His lasers would be aimed at industrial chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, which are used mainly in refrigerants and in the manufacture of plastic foams. Once released in the air, they rise high into the stratosphere where they destroy protective ozone. Stratospheric ozone helps block ultraviolet light, which can cause skin cancer and eye damage and harm natural systems. Array of Infrared Lasers
The laser system would break apart CFC's in the lower atmosphere before they had a chance to damage the ozone layer. The concentrated light would be tuned to a frequency most easily absorbed by CFC's, which is in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Dr. Stix calculates that an array of infrared lasers around the world could blast apart as one million tons of CFC a year, equal to the current annual flow into the atmosphere.
In terms of feasibility, Dr. Stix said: ''Some of the answers are known. Many aren't. A major question is whether you can get the laser's energy absorbed by CFC's and not other molecules, such as water vapor or carbon dioxide.''
Another issue, he added, is to what extent the general atmosphere would absorb laser energy, limiting propagation of the beam. Plans to Replace Ozone
A less exotic cure for ozone depletion would be to simply replace it. Experts have proposed that bulk ozone be produced on earth and lofted into the stratosphere in rockets, aircraft or balloons. Other ideas include firing aloft ''bullets'' of frozen ozone, or placing solar-powered ozone generators in high-altitude balloons. Since ozone consists of three oxygen atoms, and atmospheric oxygen has two such atoms, raw material would be plentiful.
Leon Y. Sadler, a chemical engineer at the University of Alabama, writing recently in Chemical and Engineering News, proposed using a fleet of jets to dispense ozone. His calculations showed that the number of planes needed to replenish of the ozone would be equivalent to less than 2 percent of the aircraft that haul freight in the United States.
But other scientists have calculated that the job would be many times larger. ''Ozone replacement would be a really massive, massive thing to do,'' said Michael C. MacCracken, head of atmospheric sciences at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California For now, all scientists stress the importance of reducing emission of ozone-destroying chemicals, as called for in a recent treaty.
On another front in the pollution war, scientists are proposing to counter the effects of carbon dioxide and other trace gases that are rapidly accumulating in the atmosphere. These chemicals, the by-products of fossil fuel combustion, other industrial activities and deforestation, trap heat from the sun that would otherwise be radiated back into space, acting like a greenhouse. Mimic Effect of Volcanoes
One way to thwart such gases would be to increase the reflectivity of the earth's atmosphere so that more sunlight is reflected back into space, said Dr. Broecker, the geochemist at Columbia University. This happens naturally, he said, when volcanoes spew sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. In 1982, for instance, El Chichon, a volcano in Mexico, pumped about 8 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, causing a slight planetary cooling.
Dr. Broecker said about 35 million tons of sulfur dioxide would have to be transported to the stratosphere each year to counter the global warming produced by a doubling of the carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere, which is expected in the next century. The job, he said, would require a fleet of several hundred jumbo jets.
''This is not a big expense compared to totally changing our reliance on fossil fuels,'' Dr. Broecker said in an interview. But the method would have major drawbacks, he added, noting that it would increase acid rain and give the blue sky a whitish cast.
''The point is not that the strategy is necessarily a wise one, but, rather, that purposeful global climate modification lies within our grasp,'' Dr. Broecker wrote in his book, ''How to Build a Habitable Planet.'' He added: ''One hundred years from now the temptation to take such action may be high.'' Chips on the Oceans
Other proposed ways to increase the earth's reflectivity are equally drastic. They include covering much of the world's oceans with white Styrofoam chips, which would reflect more sunlight back into space than regular ocean water, and painting the roofs of all houses white. It is not known to what extent such actions might offset global warming.
Some dream of blocking sunlight before it ever reaches the earth. Giant orbiting satellites made of thin films could cast shadows on the earth, counteracting global warming. Scientists have calculated that a series of satellites with areas equivalent to 2 percent of the earth's surface could compensate for a doubling in carbon dioxide. Some space scientists have contemplated using such shields to make Venus less hot; the costs and benefits on earth have not been determined.
Still another way of coping with greenhouse gases would be to try to remove them from the atmosphere. Measures to conserve and plant new forests, which absorb carbon, are already being discussed by public officials. More radical thinkers imagine encouraging the growth on a vast scale of tiny ocean organisms that soak up carbon dioxide. Already, the oceans are believed to be dissolving much of the extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The bodies of microscopic creatures, for instance, incorporate carbon dioxide and, when they die, they sink to the bottom of the sea and turn into limestone.
To increase this effect, scientists have proposed fertilizing the oceans to spur the growth of phytoplankton, microscopic plants that are a key element in the ocean's food chain. But this method has serious drawbacks. It would alter the marine food chain, and, if pursued too vigorously, the cascade of carbon dioxide into the deep ocean would eventually eliminate oxygen there, killing most life.
One group of experts holds that proposals to counteract climatic damage are misguided, and that advanced technologies should be used to prevent such problems in the first place, mainly by eliminating dependence on fossil fuels. Harnessing Nuclear Fusion
Dr. Peter E. Glazer, a vice president at Arthur D. Little Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., consulting and research firm, has long advocated building a fleet of solar power satellites in space. Illuminated by the sun 24 hours a day, these spacecraft would turn sunlight into electric power, which would be beamed to earth in the form of either microwave or laser beams, and then turned back into electricity. First proposed in the 1970's, the idea has recently aroused renewed interest because of its environmental allure.
A more down-to-earth way to generate power without producing carbon dioxide is to harness nuclear fusion, the process in which hydrogen isotopes fuse together to release energy in the kind of process that powers the sun, the stars and hydrogen bombs. While conventional nuclear power plants also supply energy without carbon dioxide pollution, they are mired in political, environmental and economic disputes.
The problem is achieving the fusion technique.
''Fusion is still a matter for physicists to grapple with,'' Dr. Glazer said. ''On the other hand, solar power satellites are just a matter for aerospace engineers to design and build.''
While futurists clash over the best way to save the planet with exotic technologies, other experts warn that the debate should not deflect attention from the more pragmatic approaches to dealing with climate ills.
''It's reasonable to ask if there's anything to do to repair the damage,'' said said Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist at the Environmental Defense Fund, based in New York. ''But the effort and scale of some of these things is huge. It's probably cheaper in the long run to rely on prevention rather than unusual cures.''

THE NATION; How Fighting Global Warming Could Be Painless and Profitable

Abstract: Efficiency faces a tough political and social battle. ''Power corrupts and horsepower corrupts absolutely,'' said Stephen H. Schneider, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the author of a new book, ''Global Warming.'' Owning a big car or pickup truck, even if a few bags of groceries is the heaviest load, is a symbol of affluence, he said. If solutions to protecting the atmosphere are difficult in developed countries they are all the more intractable in the rapidly developing third world, where the issue is often survival, not luxuries. Energy use in industrialized countries is growing by only 1 percent a year compared with 5 percent in the third world. Mr. [Amory B. Lovins] argues that industrialized countries must stop selling obsolete technology to the third world and help them leap directly into energy-efficient industries. ''This may take considerable infusions of Western technology and currency to make this work,'' he says. ''But they'll get more barrels out of buying Western insulation, windows and light bulbs than oil-drilling equipment.'' The price of this climate insurance will be high. Mr. Schneider calls for a ''global survival bargain'' between the world's have-nots and haves: The have-nots agree to reduce population growth and concede their standard of living will never equal that of the haves; the haves help the have-nots develop with low-polluting technology and reduce their own standard of living somewhat.

Already, Angelenos are on the cutting edge of this brave new world without leaf blowers and drive-through burger stands, facing new controls on everyday life just to clean up the breathing air, never mind the stratosphere.
UNWELCOME as it is, the prevailing view of energy and climate experts who fear a catastrophic warming of the globe is that Americans must make drastic sacrifices in their comfortable way of life. Already, Angelenos are on the cutting edge of this brave new world without leaf blowers and drive-through burger stands, facing new controls on everyday life just to clean up the breathing air, never mind the stratosphere.
But a few experts believe that in warding off climatic doom, painful sacrifices can be avoided by adopting the newest in energy-saving technology, like prototype cars that get up to 138 miles per gallon and superefficient light bulbs. A leading proponent of this theory, Amory B. Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit research group in Snowmass, Colo., says that conserving energy can actually be profitable. ''The opportunity to profit from selling efficiency is real, pervasive, and arrestingly large,'' he maintains.
No one doubts that more efficient use of energy can make a big difference. But skepticism about whether this alone can head off global warming is also real, pervasive and large, as was clear at a Soviet-American conference on the greenhouse effect late last month in Sundance, Utah. Michael Deland, chairman of President Bush's Council on Environmental Quality, said Americans and Russians must cleanse their own hands and make ''fundamental changes in life style'' before preaching to the rest of the world about using too much energy.
But less wrenching solutions were not entirely dismissed. Georgi S. Golitsyn of the Soviet Academy of Sciences said that energy for lighting, heating and refrigeration could be cut by a factor of 4 to 10 ''without diminishing the quality of life.'' But he admitted that the impediments are high. Soviet engineers have designed a turbine that uses heat produced during production of electricity, but manufacture is stalled while different ministries argue over who is to make them.
Mr. Lovins argues that about half of global warming, which is caused by the emission of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons and other industrial gases, is attributed to energy use and that three-fourths of that amount could be profitably abated by energy efficiency. For example, equipping American factories and buildings with the latest in motors and lighting fixtures would save three-quarters of all electricity used, he said, and commercially available lighting reflectors and controls could save 92 percent of lighting energy. Mr. Lovins envisions a day when saved electricity becomes a commodity itself, called ''negawatts,'' that could be traded among companies, utilities and even nations. Selling Efficiency
Skeptics call such ideas brilliant in theory, but difficult in practice. Howard P. Allen, chairman of Southern California Edison, says that efficiency does not sell. Most people, he maintains, prefer to pay 49 cents for a conventional light bulb rather than $20 each for new ones that would save $4 to $5 a year in power, though commercial customers are trying such measures. Mr. Lovins says government should make efficiency more attractive, for example by taxing cars on the basis of fuel consumption to stimulate production of the new more efficient prototypes.
But efficiency faces a tough political and social battle. ''Power corrupts and horsepower corrupts absolutely,'' said Stephen H. Schneider, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the author of a new book, ''Global Warming.'' Owning a big car or pickup truck, even if a few bags of groceries is the heaviest load, is a symbol of affluence, he said.
Analysts like Irving Mintzer of the World Resources Institute, a private research group in Washington, agree that there is room for much improvement without sacrifice in American living standards. He noted, for example, that West German industries use far less energy to make cement than American ones. But avoiding world climate change, he maintains, will also require compromises, like ride sharing and more use of mass transit. He argues for a gradual increase of the gasoline excise tax to $1 a gallon, combined with a penalty against owners of gas guzzlers paid to drivers of new efficient cars. But he said these measures would be politically impossible now.
If solutions to protecting the atmosphere are difficult in developed countries they are all the more intractable in the rapidly developing third world, where the issue is often survival, not luxuries. Energy use in industrialized countries is growing by only 1 percent a year compared with 5 percent in the third world. Mr. Lovins argues that industrialized countries must stop selling obsolete technology to the third world and help them leap directly into energy-efficient industries. ''This may take considerable infusions of Western technology and currency to make this work,'' he says. ''But they'll get more barrels out of buying Western insulation, windows and light bulbs than oil-drilling equipment.''
The price of this climate insurance will be high. Mr. Schneider calls for a ''global survival bargain'' between the world's have-nots and haves: The have-nots agree to reduce population growth and concede their standard of living will never equal that of the haves; the haves help the have-nots develop with low-polluting technology and reduce their own standard of living somewhat.

Abstract: The President's spending proposal would increase the Justice Department's budget by 19 percent from last year to nearly $9 billion, excluding funds set aside for a multiyear Federal prison construction program. The most significant increases, earmarked for anti-drug activities, were announced last week as part of President [Bush]'s new plan to combat drug trafficking. Continuing to reverse the pattern of budgets under President Reagan, Mr. Bush is proposing substantial new spending on environmental programs. Among the significant additions are $269 million for a program to provide money for acquiring parkland and for a major reforestation effort across the country. Mr. Bush is also calling for increased spending to protectwetlands, a hefty increase for research into global climate change and using nearly $780 million to clean up nuclear contamination and other pollution at Federal installations. The Administration proposed reducing Medicare premiums by $60 a year for beneficiaries who join a Health Maintenance Organization. To further encourage membership in such programs, the Administration is developing a new program, ''Medicare Plus,'' that would combine membership in a Preferred Provider Organization with Medigap, the Medicare supplemental insurance.

Drugs and Crime

Here are President Bush's budget proposals for major domestic programs for the 1991 fiscal year:
Drugs and Crime

The President's spending proposal would increase the Justice Department's budget by 19 percent from last year to nearly $9 billion, excluding funds set aside for a multiyear Federal prison construction program. The most significant increases, earmarked for anti-drug activities, were announced last week as part of President Bush's new plan to combat drug trafficking.
Some agencies in the Justice Department would suffer reductions. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance, would receive a slight spending increase, but would lose nearly 400 positions. The decrease would probably result in a reduction in the number of agents assigned to areas like organized crime and white-collar crime.
Education

The Administration proposed $41 billion for education, training, and employment programs and ancillary social services, $400 million more than would be spent under current law and $3 billion more than is expected to be spent in the current fiscal year.
The budget proposed an $880 million increase to $10 billion in spending for elementary and secondary school education for the disadvantaged.
The budget would also increase by $500 million the funds for Head Start, a program intended to prepare young children to succeed in school, for a total of $1.9 billion. The proposal would also increase by $1.2 billion, to a total of $19.7 billion, discretionary funds for education.
The budget also proposed $239 million for adult literacy programs, a 25 percent increase over the current budget.
Environment

Continuing to reverse the pattern of budgets under President Reagan, Mr. Bush is proposing substantial new spending on environmental programs. Among the significant additions are $269 million for a program to provide money for acquiring parkland and for a major reforestation effort across the country. Mr. Bush is also calling for increased spending to protectwetlands, a hefty increase for research into global climate change and using nearly $780 million to clean up nuclear contamination and other pollution at Federal installations.
The Environmental Protection Agency's total proposed budget would rise by a modest $48 million dollars to $5.6 billion. But its important operating budget, with which it administers the anti-pollution laws, would rise by 12 percent to $2.17 billion.
Health

The Administration proposed reducing Medicare premiums by $60 a year for beneficiaries who join a Health Maintenance Organization. To further encourage membership in such programs, the Administration is developing a new program, ''Medicare Plus,'' that would combine membership in a Preferred Provider Organization with Medigap, the Medicare supplemental insurance.
The proposal would also offer the states incentives to enroll people in such programs. An H.M.O. is a highly structured organization of doctors and others that offers a full range of medical services. A P.P.O. is a less structured group of doctors who have agreed to take lower fees than they would otherwise charge in exchange for a higher volume of patients.
The Administration also proposed reducing the projected growth of Medicare by $5.6 billion, and obtaining $1.9 billion more in revenues. But Medicare expenditures are still expected to increase by $10 billion, to $116 billion.
The budget would also provide a $109 million increase in AIDS research, prevention and other activities, for a total of $1.7 billion. Total spending on AIDS would be $3.1 billion.
Labor

For the Labor Department, the President proposes a small increase in spending, from $24.9 billion in the 1990 fiscal year to $26.3 billion. Most of the budget, $19.4 billion, represents benefits the Government pays to unemployed workers. If the unemployment rate is higher than the 5.3 percent the Government predicts for the year - a rate that some economists say is optimistic - that spending would rise.
Still, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole obtained room for spending increases in areas that she has put high among her priorities, including an increase of $261 million, to $5.3 billion for employment and training, she told reporters today. She would reduce spending for special summer training programs, from $715 million to $220 million, but she would raise spending from $44 million in the 1990 fiscal year to $1.4 billion for longer-term programs, especially one designed to ease young people's transition from school to work.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration would get 34 more inspectors, bringing to more than 200 the number that she has addeed since taking office.
Science and Space

A major theme of the proposed budget is investment in the future, and the Bush Administration, seeing the space program as a big part of that, wants to increase the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's budget to $15.2 billion. That would be a 24 percent rise from the previous year, which would be the largest percentage increase for any major agency.
The additional $2.9 billion includes a 36 percent increase for the space station, alloting $2.6 billion for the manned space platform, which is to be launched in 1995, so that construction could begin on those parts requiring long lead times. The space agency also asked for $237 million to start an orbiting Earth Observing System, a program that would use a series of satellites and a computer network to measure and monitor environmental changes.
Transportation

The Transportation Department requested $26.9 billion, a figure that is 4.2 percent below this year's spending level. Big increases for the Federal Aviation Administration and the Coast Guard were offset by proposals to eliminate Federal subsidies for the Amtrak rail system and to cut operating subsidies for mass transport systems in large cities. In past years Congress has refused to make similar cuts in both programs.
The department proposed to cover 77 percent of its budget through user fees, and proposed two increases in the user fees that help pay for aviation programs. The existing 8 percent tax on airline tickets would be raised to 10 percent, and local airports would be granted authority to impose their own taxes on passengers and could spend that money on airport improvements.
Agriculture

President Bush also proposed increasing spending at the Department of Agriculture by $500 million in the 1991 fiscal year to $48.7 billion. The Administration proposed changes in Federal law that would reduce spending for crop subsidy programs by $1.5 billion to $10.24 billion. The Administration has called for cuts in a broad array of programs administered by the Department of Agriculture including programs for feeding children which now cost $127 million, meat and poultry inspection costing $52 million, loans for farmers which would cost $848 million, and housing for rural families, costing $420 million.
Several programs were identified by the Administration for modest increases. The Presidents asked Congress for $38 million for basic farm research. Several lawmakers criticized the small increase at a time when consumers are calling for more field studies on cultivation practices that produce food with fewer chemicals.
Energy

The Administration has asked for $1 billion more for the Department of Energy, for a total of $17.5 billion. Much of the extra money would go into improvements to make the network of deteriorating nuclear weapons laboratories and factories safer and to clean up decades of environmental contamination. Overall, the Administration has asked Congress to approve $3.3 billion to address environmental issues, making the Energy Department one of the Government largest managers of environmental programs. In comparison the budget for the Environmental Protection Agency is $5.8 billion.
Correction: January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final
Because of an editing error, a summary article yesterday about President Bush's budget proposals for domestic programs misstated the proposed budget for the Environmental Protection Agency. It is $5.8 billion.

Economic Scene; Global Warming: Look or Leap?

Abstract: For [George Bush] the President, global warming is another of the universe's great mysteries, worthy of careful study but not precipitous response. Indeed, in deference to those who believe the globe may even be cooling, Mr. Bush now discreetly refers to the issue of ''climate change.'' In a bow to Mr. [John Sununu], a former nuclear engineer, the report notes that computer forecasts of warming necessarily turn on primitive assumptions about atmospheric dynamics. It is even conceivable that the ''greenhouse effect,'' caused by the accumulation of atmospheric pollutants that trap solar energy, will be more than offset by cooling caused by increased cloud cover. The council's views carry the most credibility on the council's own turf. The economic burden imposed by a temperature increase, the report says, may be relatively modest, while the costs of containing the greenhouse-effect pollutants over the next century may prove extraordinarily high. Increased summer temperatures could directly affect health. But while ''the average temperature differential between New York City and Atlanta is as large as the most extreme predictions of warming,'' the report notes, ''there is no evidence that Atlanta's warmer climate creates a greater health risk than New York's.''

FOR George Bush the candidate, global warming was hot stuff - not as critical to the nation's future, perhaps, as ending prison furloughs for murderers, but near the top of the list of issues that mattered to the quiche and Volvo crowd.
For George Bush the President, global warming is another of the universe's great mysteries, worthy of careful study but not precipitous response. Indeed, in deference to those who believe the globe may even be cooling, Mr. Bush now discreetly refers to the issue of ''climate change.''
This transformation has been widely reported as an ideological victory for John Sununu, the President's conservative guru. But it also represents a technocratic victory for President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, and in particular for one council member, Richard Schmalensee, an expert on regulation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The council's annual report, published last week, offers the economist's case for looking a while longer before we leap.
In a bow to Mr. Sununu, a former nuclear engineer, the report notes that computer forecasts of warming necessarily turn on primitive assumptions about atmospheric dynamics. It is even conceivable that the ''greenhouse effect,'' caused by the accumulation of atmospheric pollutants that trap solar energy, will be more than offset by cooling caused by increased cloud cover.
But the council's views carry the most credibility on the council's own turf. The economic burden imposed by a temperature increase, the report says, may be relatively modest, while the costs of containing the greenhouse-effect pollutants over the next century may prove extraordinarily high. Increased summer temperatures could directly affect health. But while ''the average temperature differential between New York City and Atlanta is as large as the most extreme predictions of warming,'' the report notes, ''there is no evidence that Atlanta's warmer climate creates a greater health risk than New York's.''
Higher temperatures are likely, however, to reduce overall agricultural productivity. According to the Department of Agriculture, the net costs worldwide of a doubling of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, would run from $35 billion to $170 billion annually.
That is a lot of money. But it amounts to just 1 percent of current world income. And as the council argues, it is in the same ball park as the costs of Government regulations that now distort food production and reduce its total value. To put it another way, freer markets in agriculture, the council suggests, could more than offset greenhouse-effect losses.
On the other side of the ledger, controlling carbon dioxide emissions would be no small undertaking. There is no practical way to trap carbon emissions from smokestacks or tailpipes. And according to one study cited by the council, the energy conservation needed to reduce carbon dioxide output by 20 percent in the United States over the next 110 years would cost from $800 billion to $3.6 trillion.
Nor, the council notes, would that titanic conservation effort be worth much if the rest of the world did not follow suit. Europeans and Japanese, who are less addicted to fossil fuels than Americans, may be ready to make the sacrifice. But developing countries, most notably China, are not about to slow industrialization to keep Boston cool or spare Iowa from drought.
Is the council right to be so cautious? While it is hard to find an economist who believes the benefits of slowing global warming exceed the costs, many economically sophisticated environmentalists still believe many anti-greenhouse measures are worth it in any case.
One class of extremely potent greenhouse gases, the chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) used primarily in refrigerators and air-conditioners, are also responsible for most damage to the ozone layer. The United States is already committed to ending CFC production gradually to forestall a worldwide epidemic of skin cancer. Why not buy a little extra insurance against global warming, environmentalists argue, by accelerating the phase-out?
Then there is the issue of energy conservation. Some forms of carbon-controlling conservation, almost everyone agrees, would be extremely expensive. But other measures - for example, efficiency improvements in home appliances and commercial lighting - would probably save more in electricity bills than they would cost in new equipment.
The council accepts in principle the idea that some anti-warming initiatives could be justified on unrelated merits. The challenge for the Bush Administration will be to translate those principles into policy - to stop looking at global warming as a yes-or-no question and look for cheap ways to exploit the maybes.

Full text: LEAD: About $300 million a year in existing Federal energy research money should be diverted to projects that could help fight global warming, a panel of scientists says.
Scientists say atmospheric buildups of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons and other gases - mostly from the burning of oil, coal and other fossil fuels - could cause a disastrous warming of the Earth's temperature.
The Bush Administration argues that there is still too much scientific uncertainty to warrant expensive steps, such as a proposed worldwide ceiling on carbon dioxide emissions.
The research council's Committee on Alternative Energy Research and Development Strategies, led by David L. Morrison of the IIT Research Institute in Chicago, was asked to consider what policy steps should be taken if the Government decides to take action on global warming.
Statement by the Secretary

The panel said that funds in the Energy Department's current research budget should be shifted to earmark about $300 million a year for projects to improve energy efficiency and encouraging adoption of technology that would cut ''greenhouse'' gas emissions.
These steps ''would make sense for other reasons even in the absence of concerns about global climate change,'' the panel said.
To get the money, the scientists said the Energy Department could reduce spending on research into fusion power, fossil energy and other projects.
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins welcomed the report in a statement, but said the department's current research projects should not be cut.
''Although we agree with the priorities highlighted by this study, we believe that these priorities should not be met at the expense of other programs promising substantial, long-term environmental and energy security benefits,'' he said.
The committee did not make a precise cost estimate for what it called an insurance strategy for advanced research into renewable energy, conservation, nuclear energy and a range of other new ideas.
''These alternative technologies would be developed to the level necessary to understand their costs and impacts if concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change heighten,'' it said.

Abstract: The problem is that coal produces more carbon dioxide when burned than most other fossil fuels. Not that oil and gas are clean. Burning of the three fossil fuels is overloading the atmosphere with carbon dioxide, believed to be the chief e of global warming. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has told the world that global carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced. And Mulroney is under considerable pressure to set an example by cutting carbon emissions at home. Worldwide, man pumps an estimated 4.5 to 5.5 billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere each year in the form of carbon dioxide, largely through the burning of oil, gas, coal, and wood in the western world. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen by 25 per cent since the middle of the 19th century.

Full text: Â  Six coal trains a day roll through the Rocky Mountains, down the Fraser River and dump their loads at the largest coal terminal in North America.
Just south of Vancouver, the Roberts Bank superport is the gateway to vast overseas markets for the Canadian coal industry, which is gearing up for the fight of its life.
As federal Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard said earlier this year: "Coal burning is a terrible pollutant. Not the future for this country."
The problem is that coal produces more carbon dioxide when burned than most other fossil fuels. Not that oil and gas are clean. Burning of the three fossil fuels is overloading the atmosphere with carbon dioxide, believed to be the chief e of global warming.
There is no technology available to contain the pollutant and no quick fix for the fossil fuel industries.
All of which makes executives more than a little nervous.
"It's absolutely frightening when you go to Ottawa and you hear senior government people saying: 'Coal is bad. Shut it down,' " says Richard Marshall, president of the Coal Association of Canada, which argues that burning coal more efficiently is the way to reduce emissions.
He and his associates are a long way from convincing their critics, who envision a world heated to deadly extremes by man-made carbon dioxide.
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has told the world that global carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced. And Mulroney is under considerable pressure to set an example by cutting carbon emissions at home.
The carbon dioxide issue is so explosive it threatens to set off a federal-provincial war: The coal with "no future" is concentrated in the Maritimes and the western provinces. It supplies more than 90 per cent of Alberta's electricity, employs 11,512 Canadians and is at the heart of a $2.2 billion industry.
Reducing carbon dioxide emissions also means the government will have to take on multi-national oil companies and the powerful automotive industry, which employs thousands of Canadians and sells more than a million cars and trucks a year.
And it means Canadian consumers could soon be paying a "carbon tax" every time they fill up their tanks with carbon-laden gasoline. A 2.5-cent-a-litre tax, being promoted by environmentalists and under study by the federal government, could generate $40 billion over the next 15 years to pay for energy conservation programs, renewable energy development and reforestation programs.
While public opinion polls indicate that consumers would be willing to pay such a tax, no one is pretending that introducing it or any other carbon-reducing measure is going to be easy.
"Dealing with the issue in the real world becomes politically very difficult . . . You run into a minefield of employment questions and inter-provincial jealousies," says Environment Canada's Henry Hengeveld, a top federal adviser on carbon dioxide and climate change.
There is sure to be a long and heated debate about how much more oil, gas and coal Canadian industry can and should extract from the ground. And there will be lengthy talks about the pros and cons of building more nuclear reactors, which have radioactivity problems but do not produce carbon dioxide pollution.
In the meantime, environmentalists say the Mulroney government should be doing more to promote energy conservation and to encourage use of biomass, solar and other forms of alternative energy.
Hengeveld agrees, saying: "It would be like buying insurance. Even if turns out we're all wrong about climate change, it (conservation and renewables) wouldn't do any harm."
Worldwide, man pumps an estimated 4.5 to 5.5 billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere each year in the form of carbon dioxide, largely through the burning of oil, gas, coal, and wood in the western world. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen by 25 per cent since the middle of the 19th century.
The debate is no longer if the world's atmosphere is changing but how fast, says Hengeveld: The five warmest years in the past century have occurred since 1980 with disastrous consequences on crop yields and world weather patterns.
There are dire forecasts about a hotter world if carbon emissions continue to climb. And emissions will rocket if China and India, home of a large portion of the world's coal reserves, proceed with plans to significantly increase their coal use in coming years.
All of which makes it important for developed nations, such as Canada, to lead the way by taking steps to control emissions, say Hengeveld and his associates.
This country produces little more than two per cent of the man- made carbon dioixide in the world. But Canadians are at the top of the list in terms of per capita production of carbon: More than four tonnes for every man, woman and child.
If Canada's current energy consumption - which is also the highest per capita in the world and twice that of Sweden - continues climbing, the country's carbon dioxide emissions can be expected to increase anywhere from 25 to 52 per cent by 2005, says Environment Canada consultant John Doucet, who is echoed by a recently released federal-provincial task force report on global warming.
Doucet estimates that by making optimum use of energy-conserving technology already available - lightweight cars, efficient refrigerators and industrial processes - Canada's energy consumption could be cut by 18 per cent by 2005 and carbon emissions by 22 per cent.
Increasing the use of wind, biomass and solar energy could result in even bigger savings - a 28- to 51-per-cent cut in carbon emissions depending on how far and fast the alternatives are introduced.
Environmentalists such as Kai Millyard of Friends of the Earth say the Conservatives' decisions to slash energy conservation programs and subsidize oil and gas megaprojects will see much unnecessary carbon heading into the already overloaded atmosphere.
Alberta's OSLO tar sands project, which has been promised $1.323 million in federal assistance, will produce crude oil that generates almost twice as much carbon per unit of energy as conventional oil, says Millyard, the global warming specialist at Friends of the Earth.
He and his associates also say that the Hibernia oil project in Newfoundland, which has been promised $3 billion in federal money, will aggravate the country's carbon pollution problems and at the same time create unfair competition for more environmentally sound energy systems that do not receive government subsidies.
Hengeveld sees a long battle ahead: "The core of the problem - that is fossil fuels - is the backbone of the industrial age."
One need not look far for evidence.
The gas stations dotting Canadian street corners and the pipelines traversing the country attest to the country's reliance on oil and gas.
Rail lines haul millions of tonnes of coal to power plants in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. At Roberts Bank in B.C., 20 million tonnes of coal are loaded on to ships each year bound for the furnaces at steel mills and power plants in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Brazil and Chile.
If plans to increase the port's capacity by 50 per cent a year proceed, 33 million tonnes of coal a year will be exported. Once burned, it could pump more than 30 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere.

The move would be part of a federal strategy to combat global warming that could force changes in many areas of Canadian life, from driving habits to home construction.
"We have no choice," Bouchard said after testifying on climate change before a joint session of eight parliamentary committees. "Even if the evidence is not conclusive ... we still have to take out an insurance policy - the insurance policy to limit carbon dioxide emissions as much as possible."
Bouchard did not say what target he has in mind to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, or what measures will be introduced to reach it.

Carbon dioxide is produced by burning fossil fuels and when forests are cut down more quickly than they are regrown. The gas traps heat from the sun, which many experts say leads to warming of Earth.

Foolhardy ideas on climate control; Economist's plan would leave Earth in dire shape: [FINAL Edition]

Author: Suzuki, David

Abstract: As an economist, [William D. Nordhaus] thinks planetary climate is irrelevant to urban life: "Cities are increasingly becoming climate- proofed by technological changes like air-conditioning and shopping malls." Even though our very lives depend on nutrition that comes from agriculture that is very climate-sensitive, to Nordhaus, food can be written off: "For the bulk of the economy, however - manufacturing, mining, utilities, finance, trade and most services - climate change over the next few decades is likely to have less effect than the economic reunification of Germany this summer." With a faith in the capacity of human ingenuity to solve our problems and improve our lives, Nordhaus' choice to counter global warming is technology: "The option of climate engineering has been completely neglected. Possibilities include shooting particulate matter into the stratosphere to cool the earth, altering land-use patterns to change the globe's reflectivity, and cultivating carbon- eating organisms in the oceans."

Economists are arguably the most influential group of professional people in the world today as their every pronouncement carries vast repercussions. No wonder the planet is in such desperate shape.
Economists live in a dream world that bears no relationship to the things that keep us alive. Consider this.
Blistering heat wave
I have just returned to Canada after sweltering through 10 days of a blistering heat wave in England that reached the highest temperature in English history - 37 degrees Celsius - on Aug. 3, 1990.
This could well eclipse 1989 as England's hottest year on record.
Scanning newspapers in England, I learned of record air pollution in cities, water shortages, increases in forest fires, increases in insurance claims for damage to homes, the collapse of market gardening, drownings and other heat-related deaths, skyrocketing prices of cheese and milk, and a drastic decrease in holiday bookings.
I can attest to the suffocating build-up of low-level ozone in London and chaos in train schedules as tracks buckled under the heat. That short heat wave had tremendous repercussions throughout English society.
Is the weather instability we seem to be seeing around the world merely the normal fluctuations of nature or the consequences of global warming?
Significantly increased
Human activity has already significantly increased global temperature, as P.D. Jones and T.M.L. Wigley report in the August 1990 edition of Scientific American.
So what do economists have to say about it? Here is the response of Yale University professor William D. Nordhaus in The Economist of July 7, 1990.
He acknowledges that "scientific monitoring has firmly established the build-up of the main greenhouse gases."
But as an economist, Nordhaus thinks planetary climate is irrelevant to urban life: "Cities are increasingly becoming climate- proofed by technological changes like air-conditioning and shopping malls."
The economic importance of industrialization apparently renders Americans exempt from the physical world:
"Greenhouse warming would have little effect on America's national output. About three per cent of American GNP originates in climate- sensitive sectors as farming and forestry. Another 10 per cent comes from sectors only modestly sensitive - energy, water systems, property and construction.
Far the largest share - 87 per cent - comes from sectors, including most services, that are negligibly affected by climate change."
Even though our very lives depend on nutrition that comes from agriculture that is very climate-sensitive, to Nordhaus, food can be written off: "For the bulk of the economy, however - manufacturing, mining, utilities, finance, trade and most services - climate change over the next few decades is likely to have less effect than the economic reunification of Germany this summer."
His reasoning is like concluding that since the stomach is a minor organ compared to the brain, we can do without it.
But what about the urgent warnings about increasing greenhouse gases?
Here's Nordhaus' response: "All these prognostications are judgments based on immense uncertainties. They could be dead wrong. This uncertainty must affect mankind's choice of responses to the threat of global warming."
Since Nordhaus, like most economists, place the economy above all else when it comes to matters environmental, he finds the economic costs of meeting the greenhouse effect head-on too great.
Nordhaus calculates the bill for a 60-per-cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at over $300 billion annually.
Human ingenuity
With a faith in the capacity of human ingenuity to solve our problems and improve our lives, Nordhaus' choice to counter global warming is technology: "The option of climate engineering has been completely neglected. Possibilities include shooting particulate matter into the stratosphere to cool the earth, altering land-use patterns to change the globe's reflectivity, and cultivating carbon- eating organisms in the oceans."
He then dismisses the fact that "such measures would raise profound legal, ethical and environmental issues" because the technological attempts would also probably be far more cost- effective than shutting down the world's power plants."
There you have it folks, the world seen through the bizarre lenses of an economist.
We are grossly ignorant about the factors that shape climate and weather while history is full of examples of even the most benign of technologies having unpredictable and undesirable consequences when applied on a massive scale.
It would be absolutely foolhardy to believe that we can come up with a technological fix for greenhouse warming.
Nordhaus even suggests that we can adapt our lifestyles and economy to the unpredictable and chaotic consequences of global warming.
My 10 days in England suggest that if the predicted warming does occur, it will be socially and economically disastrous.
We have no choice. We must begin to massively cut down on greenhouse-gas emissions now, else we leave our children to pay the disastrous price of trusting economists with their foolhardy ideas.

Abstract: OTTAWA (CP) - The federal government will set a national target and timetable by this fall for cutting carbon dioxide emissions, Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard says. "What are we going to do? We have no choice," Bouchard said yesterday after testifying on climate change before an extraordinary joint session of eight parliamentary committees. Bouchard made it clear the Canadian target will be set independently of global negotiations. He said Energy Minister Jake Epp backs him in making this commitment.

Full text: OTTAWA (CP) - The federal government will set a national target and timetable by this fall for cutting carbon dioxide emissions, Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard says.
The move would be part of a federal strategy to combat global warming.
The strategy could force changes in many areas of Canadian life, from driving habits to home construction and from manufacturing to forest management.
"What are we going to do? We have no choice," Bouchard said yesterday after testifying on climate change before an extraordinary joint session of eight parliamentary committees.
"Even if the evidence is not conclusive . . . we still have to take out an insurance policy - the insurance policy to limit carbon dioxide emissions as much as possible."
Carbon dioxide is produced when fossil fuels are burned and when forests are cut down more quickly than they are regrown. The gas traps heat from the sun. And many scientists say it will lead to an unprecedented warming of the Earth.
But there's no consensus on how fast the change will occur and what its effects will be.
Last month, federal and provincial environment ministers decided it would be premature to set national targets for cutting carbon dioxide.
They said "the place to resolve the question of targets is in the context of international negotiations."
But Bouchard made it clear the Canadian target will be set independently of global negotiations. He said Energy Minister Jake Epp backs him in making this commitment.
Much of the scientific evidence on climate change is based on complex computer models which simulate the atmosphere, including variables such as cloud cover, solar radiation and composition of gases.
"They all point in the same direction: Yes, there is a climatic change in process," Bouchard said.

Why Canada must act on global warning: [SA2 Edition]

Author: Suzuki, David

Abstract: Last year, the Marshall Institute, a right-wing think tank, published a paper that concluded that the temperature increase already observed over the past century merely resulted from the sun's variations. With greater evaporation and cloud formation, the article suggested, the Earth would be shielded from sunlight and actually become cooler. The business magazine Forbes used the report to excoriate environmentalists for their alarmist exaggerations while U.S. President George Bush was persuaded to oppose the imposition of any targets for limiting emissions. It must be pointed out that the Marshall Institute staunchly supported former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), which was overwhelmingly opposed by the scientific community as technologically impossible and an escalation in the arms race. At a scientific press conference in New York, I was astonished to witness physicist Robert Jastrow launch a vicious personal attack on a highly respected scientist who opposed SDI. Jastrow was one of the authors of the Marshall Institute report on global warming. One's position on global warming has become ideological. Other countries are already acting. "West Germany has adopted the target of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions by 25 per cent in 2005 from 1987 levels; Denmark and New Zealand will attempt to reduce carbon- dioxide emissions by 20 per cent in 2000 from 1990 levels . . . The committee concludes that the Toronto target - a 20 per cent reduction in the 1988 level of emissions by 2005 - is the minimum that Canada should strive for as an interim goal."

Full text: VANCOUVER - Next week the Second International Conference on Global Climate will convene in Geneva, Switzerland. The first conference was held in Toronto in May, 1988, and brought global warming into the political arena as Prime Minister Brian Mulroney opened the conference and spoke of the importance of the environment.
Participants warned about the unprecedented increase and accumulation of human-created greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons) that could cause forests to die, farmland to become desert and sea levels to rise. The conference adopted a proposal to reduce by 20 per cent carbon-dioxide production from 1988 levels within 15 years.
To date, Canada has done nothing and now the reality of the dangers is being questioned. The reasons for reluctance to reduce greenhouse gases are obvious: A serious effort will require a large investment, changes in lifestyle and a fundamental shift away from the relentless priority of growth.
The greenhouse effect is exaggerated, it is argued, because (a) fluctuations in global temperature have occurred in the past and (b) extinction is normal since 99 per cent of all species that ever lived are now extinct. These two points fail to consider the rate of change. The warming that ended the last Ice Age was of the order of a degree every millennium in contrast to possible coming changes of several degrees per century. And in the past, extinction rates were a species or two a year, while now we are already losing more than two species an hour.
A more serious criticism of people concerned about global warming is the lack of hard evidence to back up their fears. The fact is, greenhouse gases have been accumulating in the upper atmosphere for decades and there has been a sharp increase in our output in recent years. Most climatologists believe that warming is already happening and will accelerate. But our ignorance about the factors influencing weather and climate is so great that is impossible to make a realistic scientific prediction.
Last year, the Marshall Institute, a right-wing think tank, published a paper that concluded that the temperature increase already observed over the past century merely resulted from the sun's variations. With greater evaporation and cloud formation, the article suggested, the Earth would be shielded from sunlight and actually become cooler. The business magazine Forbes used the report to excoriate environmentalists for their alarmist exaggerations while U.S. President George Bush was persuaded to oppose the imposition of any targets for limiting emissions.
An editorial in the Globe and Mail, headlined "What we don't know about global warming," warned that action to avert global warming would have vast economic repercussions. Citing the Marshall Institute report, the editorial concluded: "In the absence of more solid information on the dimensions of the danger, the proposed insurance premiums seem out of proportion to apparent risk."
It must be pointed out that the Marshall Institute staunchly supported former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), which was overwhelmingly opposed by the scientific community as technologically impossible and an escalation in the arms race. At a scientific press conference in New York, I was astonished to witness physicist Robert Jastrow launch a vicious personal attack on a highly respected scientist who opposed SDI. Jastrow was one of the authors of the Marshall Institute report on global warming. One's position on global warming has become ideological.
The interim report of the all-party standing committee on environment that was tabled last week put the issue of global warming into its proper perspective. While acknowledging the uncertainties of climate prediction, the committee members "nonetheless accept the argument that the precautionary principle must apply in so vital a situation. By the time scientists have all the answers to these questions, global climate may have been driven by human society to the point where the answers are largely academic."
The report goes on to warn of the reality of atmospheric change and sees "no validity in the argument that governments should delay acting until more detailed information on the likely effects of global climate is gathered . . .If the skeptics are correct and climate change is less of a problem than most scientists anticipate, the policies which we are proposing will still return many benefits, both environmental and economic."
Other countries are already acting. "West Germany has adopted the target of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions by 25 per cent in 2005 from 1987 levels; Denmark and New Zealand will attempt to reduce carbon- dioxide emissions by 20 per cent in 2000 from 1990 levels . . . The committee concludes that the Toronto target - a 20 per cent reduction in the 1988 level of emissions by 2005 - is the minimum that Canada should strive for as an interim goal."
We should closely watch Canada's position in Geneva next week.
