Abstract: The cost of weather-related disasters in Canada - ice storms, windstorms, floods and droughts -has skyrocketed over the past 15 years, rising 20 to 30 times over, says the Emergency Preparedness Canada (EPC) report. "The much more rapidly increasing rate of loss from climactically related disasters such as floods, storms and droughts may indeed suggest that these latter hazards may be increasing in frequency and severity," says the study, entitled Disaster Mitigation and Preparedness in a Changing Climate. It suggests a disaster-mitigation strategy should identify potential flood plains and restrict development on them; develop building codes that recognize bridges and buildings will have to bear heavier snow loads and withstand higher winds; and encourage municipalities to build storm sewers that can handle increased rainfalls.

Full text:   Financial losses from severe weather events in Canada have increased at 10 times the rate of the country's economic growth since the mid-'80s, says a study prepared for the federal disaster agency.
The cost of weather-related disasters in Canada - ice storms, windstorms, floods and droughts -has skyrocketed over the past 15 years, rising 20 to 30 times over, says the Emergency Preparedness Canada (EPC) report.
Insured losses peaked in 1998 at more than $1.1 billion, largely due to the ice storm that devastated parts of Ontario and Quebec in January 1998.
Cost to Insurers Soared
In 1984, Canada's insurance industry paid out only $39 million in claims as a result of weather-related disasters.
Over the past 15 years, Canada's economic output has doubled, but neither the increasing value of Canada's infrastructure nor inflation can account for the country's soaring disaster costs, which are increasingly borne by the federal government, the report concludes.
"The much more rapidly increasing rate of loss from climactically related disasters such as floods, storms and droughts may indeed suggest that these latter hazards may be increasing in frequency and severity," says the study, entitled Disaster Mitigation and Preparedness in a Changing Climate.
The report suggests man-made climate change may be the reason.
James Bruce, one of the country's leading climate scientists and an author of the study, said computer models show that as Earth's atmosphere warms, its ability to soak up moisture increases. That means, he said, that more moisture will be available in the atmosphere to fall as rain or snow.
"It's still very difficult to sort out what the major causes of the enormous increase in disaster losses are, but climate change is almost certainly a factor," Bruce said yesterday.
Bruce was one of the Canadian representatives on a United Nations scientific panel that studied global climate change and its potential effects on the world's weather systems. The panel's 1995 report became the foundation for the Kyoto agreement, which commits the world's industrialized countries, including Canada, to greenhouse-gas reductions over the next decade.
The three primary greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide - are produced largely through the burning of coal, oil and gasoline.
The EPC report, which calls on Ottawa to spend money now to mitigate future storm-related damages, notes that climate models predict Canada will experience shorter, warmer winters marked by more intense storms that are likely to produce more flooding.
The report also predicts:
n Extremes of the hydrological cycle, floods and droughts, will become more frequent, with heavy storms increasing in frequency by more than 50 per cent. What are now 100-year floods, like the Manitoba's Red River flood of 1997, could become 50-year occurrences.
n Annual lightning strikes could increase by 44 per cent, damaging as much as half of Canada's boreal forest over the next 50 years.
The report argues that since weather-related disasters are likely to become more frequent - and more expensive to taxpayers - it makes sense to launch a national emergency preparedness plan.
The federal government paid out more in 1998 for disaster assistance - nearly $1.3 billion - than it did in the previous 15 years combined. Last year, Ottawa paid out another $312 million in disaster assistance.
Bruce said the federal government now leaves disaster-prevention work entirely to the provinces, even though it continues to write large cheques in the aftermath of storms and floods.
A federal program to limit flood damage was abandoned during the deficit-inspired budget cuts of the mid-'90s.
"The need to encourage timely, cost-effective means to save lives, reduce property damage and limit disaster costs has never been more apparent," the EPC report concludes.
Tighten Building Codes
It suggests a disaster-mitigation strategy should identify potential flood plains and restrict development on them; develop building codes that recognize bridges and buildings will have to bear heavier snow loads and withstand higher winds; and encourage municipalities to build storm sewers that can handle increased rainfalls.
The reports also said Canadian families should be encouraged to prepare for weather disasters by equipping themselves with enough supplies to survive for 48 hours on their own.

Abstract: Insured losses peaked in 1998 at $1.45 billion, largely due to the ice storm that devastated parts of Ontario and Quebec in January, 1998. In 1984, Canada's insurance industry paid out only $39 million in claims as a result of weather-related disasters.During the past 15 years, Canada's economic output has doubled, but neither the increasing value of Canada's economic infrastructure nor inflation can account for the country's rapidly rising disaster costs, which are increasingly being borne by the federal government, the report concludes. "The much more rapidly increasing rate of loss from climactically related disasters such as floods, storms and droughts may indeed suggest that these latter hazards may be increasing in frequency and severity," says the study, entitled Disaster Mitigation and Preparedness in a Changing Climate.

Full text: OTTAWA - Financial losses from severe weather events in Canada have increased at ten times the rate of the country's economic growth since the mid-'80s, says a study prepared for the federal disaster agency.
The cost of weather-related disasters in Canada -- ice storms, windstorms, floods and droughts --have skyrocketed over the past 15 years, rising 20 to 30 times over, says Emergency Preparedness Canada (EPC) report.
Insured losses peaked in 1998 at $1.45 billion, largely due to the ice storm that devastated parts of Ontario and Quebec in January, 1998. In 1984, Canada's insurance industry paid out only $39 million in claims as a result of weather-related disasters.During the past 15 years, Canada's economic output has doubled, but neither the increasing value of Canada's economic infrastructure nor inflation can account for the country's rapidly rising disaster costs, which are increasingly being borne by the federal government, the report concludes.
"The much more rapidly increasing rate of loss from climactically related disasters such as floods, storms and droughts may indeed suggest that these latter hazards may be increasing in frequency and severity," says the study, entitled Disaster Mitigation and Preparedness in a Changing Climate.
The report suggests man-made climate change may be the reason behind the more frequent and costly storm episodes.
James Bruce, one of the country's leading climate scientists and an author of the study, said computer models show that as the earth's atmosphere warms, its ability to soak up moisture increases. It means, he said, that more moisture will be available in the atmosphere to fall as rain or snow.
"It's still very difficult to sort out what the major causes of the enormous increase in disaster losses are, but climate change is almost certainly a factor," Bruce said Monday.
Bruce was one of the Canadian representatives on a United Nations scientific panel that studied global climate change and its potential effects on the world's weather systems. The panel's 1995 report became the foundation for the Kyoto agreement, which commits the world's industrialized countries, including Canada, to greenhouse gas reductions over the next decade.
The three primary greenhouse gases --carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide -- are produced largely through the burning of coal, oil and gasoline.
The EPCreport, which calls on Ottawa to spend money now to mitigate future storm-related damages, notes that climate models predict Canada will experience shorter, warmer winters marked by more intense storms that are likely to produce more flooding.
The report also predicts, extremes of the hydrological cycle, floods and droughts, will become more frequent with heavy storms increasing in frequency by more than 50 per cent. It means what are now 100-year floods, like the Manitoba's Red River flood of 1997, could become 50-year occurrences.

The report suggests man-made climate change may be one factor behind the more frequent and costly storm episodes.
The EPC report, which calls on Ottawa to spend money now to mitigate future storm-related damages, notes that climate models predict Canada will experience shorter, warmer winters marked by more intense storms that are likely to produce more flooding.
The report argues that since weather-related disasters are likely to become more frequent --and more expensive to taxpayers -- it only makes sense to launch a national emergency preparedness plan.
The federal government paid out more in 1998 for disaster assistance -- $1.2 billion --than in the previous 15 years combined. Last year, Ottawa paid out another $312-million in disaster assistance.
James Bruce, one of the country's leading climate scientists and an author of the study, said the federal government now leaves disaster prevention work entirely to the provinces even though it continues to write large cheques in the aftermath of storms and floods.
A federal program to reduce flood damage was abandoned during the deficit-inspired budget cuts of the mid-'90s.
"The need to encourage timely, cost effective means to save lives, reduce property damage and limit disaster costs has never been more apparent, particularly with the prospect of extreme weather events becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change," the EPC report concludes.
It suggests a disaster mitigation strategy should identify potential flood plains and restrict development on them; develop building codes that recognize bridges and buildings will have to bear heavier snow loads and withstand higher winds; and encourage municipalities to build storm sewers that can handle increased rainfalls.
The reports also said Canadian families should be encouraged to prepare for weather disasters by equipping themselves with enough supplies to survive for 48 hours on their own.

Disaster bill tops $80 billion in '99: [5 Edition]

Abstract: A total of 702 major natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes occurred worldwide in 1999, exceeding the 700 recorded in 1998, according to Munich Re.

Full text:   CATASTROPHE LOSSES
A total of 702 major natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes occurred worldwide in 1999, exceeding the 700 recorded in 1998, according to Munich Re.
Total economic losses amounted to some $80 billion in 1999, the company said. This figure has been exceeded only twice before -- in 1998 ($93 billion) and 1995 ($180 billion, as the result of the earthquake in Kobe, Japan).
The insured losses of about $18 billion were the third highest in this century following 1992 ($26 billion, the result of Hurricane Andrew in Florida) and 1994 ($21 billion from the earthquake in Northridge/Los Angeles).
Losses from the violent storms that swept Europe in the last week of December have not been included in these figures. Consequently the total economic and insured losses will rise considerably once the damage has been evaluated.
During 1999, there were numerous spectacular large catastrophes -- earthquakes in Colombia, Turkey, Greece, and Taiwan; avalanches in the Alps; floods in central Europe and south-eastern Asia; tornadoes in Oklahoma and the hailstorm in Sydney, Australia; hurricanes and cyclones in the United States, Japan, and India.
Hurricanes accounted for 70 percent of insured damage, followed by earthquakes at 18 percent, floods at 6 percent, and other disasters including forest fires and volcano eruptions at 6 percent, it said.
Munich Re said the frequency of natural disasters has been increasing in the 1990s and that its research team sees "no chance of a decrease . . . for the foreseeable time." It said the rapidly growing world population, urbanization and climate change were partly to blame for the increase in disasters, and also pointed out the vulnerability of modern industrial society to catastrophes. Munich Re's Geoscience Research Group (comprising 14 scientists under its head, Dr. Gerhard Berz) has been recording catastrophe data on a global scale for more than 25 years.

Full text: TORONTO - Gordon Toole remembers the day it was so cold that spit froze before it hit the ground.
Toole was one of about 20 men working at a military airport at Snag, Yukon, when the temperature plunged to the deepest low ever recorded in North America.
"You can't breathe through your nostrils in air that temperature, it's almost as though they're blocked or frozen," he says from Snag, about 320 kilometres northwest of Yellowknife. "You have to breath through your mouth but they're shallow breaths.
"You cannot take deep breaths because they just catch in your throat, you're gasping."
Toole recalls the crystal clarity of sounds. He could distinctly hear the barking of dogs in a village some five kilometres away. An airplane overhead was deafening.
FROZE IN THE AIR
As an experiment, the men flipped a saucer of water into the air at waist height: it landed on the ground in hard pellets.
The temperature was so low it couldn't be recorded on a mercury thermometer. Even in an alcohol thermometer, the liquid sank below the lowest temperature mark, settling into the bulb at the bottom.
They marked the point with a small file -- a pen wouldn't work -- and sent the thermometer to Toronto. Days later the reading was confirmed: --62.2C.
The record set at Snag on Feb. 3, 1947, still stands. For Canadians who seemingly never get tired of talking about the weather, it's a classic tale, especially since there were no casualties and no real damage.
Recent years have seen many weather extremes that were not so benign.
Few residents of Eastern Canada have forgotten the ice storm in 1998, when millions shivered in darkened houses or sought refuge in crowded public shelters.
TOWNS SUBMERGED
Few residents of Manitoba have forgotten the flood of 1997, when the Red River turned into a vast sea, driving some 28,000 people from their homes and submerging whole towns.
The Saguenay Flood of 1996 caused massive damage, as did the Calgary hail storm of 1997. Unpredictable Prairie weather has helped reduce Canada's breadbasket to a basket case as the year 2000 nears.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimates that insurance payments for extreme weather events across the country have been doubling every five to 10 years. Payouts last year reached $1.5 billion.
"The weather in Canada has been frightful," says Paul Kovaks, a spokesman for the bureau.
Munich Re of Munich, Germany, one of the world's biggest reinsurance companies, estimates global losses from weather-related natural disasters have increased to $90 billion annually from $7 billion to $8 billion annually in the 1980s.
Part of the rising toll results from population growth -- there's simply more property to be damaged, and more of it is built in risky areas like flood plains and coastlines.
Paradoxically, modern technology can also increase vulnerability to extreme weather since vital energy and communications systems across large areas are intertwined.
"The disaster is the event plus our vulnerability," says federal climatologist Roger Street. "Higher dependence on networked energy, higher dependence on telecommunications, makes us more vulnerable."
Climatologists would like to come up with an extreme-weather index so they could measure the apparent rise in instability. One of the problems is they can't agree on how to define an extreme weather event.
The great ice storm, for example, did not involve record-setting precipitation. It resulted from multiple factors, none of which would in itself be ranked as highly unusual; it was the combination that was unusual.
The favourite scapegoat for strange meteorological goings on in the 1990s has been El Nino, a periodic warming of the southern and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, or its twin sister La Nina, a cooling current in the same area.
Climatologist David Phillips says in his recent book Blame it on the Weather that El Nino has become the scapegoat for everything from whale beachings in China to increased crime in Saskatoon.
EL NINO GETTING STRONGER
But using the El Nino as a scapegoat merely pushes the mystery to a deeper level. Why has El Nino been causing so much more trouble than it used to?
Records show El Nino events have been getting stronger since the late 1970s, with the most severe events on record occurring in 1982- 83 and in 1997-98. The longest El Nino on record lasted from 1990 to mid-1995.
Is El Nino a messenger for something much bigger?
Few credible scientists dispute that the climate is warming: the finding has been confirmed by countless studies. There has been great debate about whether the trend is due to natural variability or human influence. Now that debate also seems to be settled.
Over the past century the average temperature of earth has risen by close to one degree Celsius. Now the big controversy concerns how fast future warming will occur and how it will affect different regions.
COMPUTER SIMULATION
Much of the research is done with computer models simulating the atmosphere -- programs so complex that they push existing hardware to its limits. The models have many warts but they're getting better.
"There's some uncertainty, but I feel much safer, much more confident making a weather forecast for the year 2090 than I do an economic or a demographic or a political kind of forecast," says Phillips of the federal Environment Department's atmospheric environment service.
For example, the models show a balmy future for Toronto: "What Kentucky has now is what in fact Toronto will inherit in terms of its climate probably a hundred years from now.
"We've warmed up Toronto by maybe 0.6 of a degree and now we're talking about warming in the summertime of four to five degrees, five to nine degrees in the winter. There's going to be really a leap forward in terms of the climate."
Canadians may welcome the prospect of milder winters, but what about the prospect of more frequent and severe droughts, floods and storms?
"It is extreme events that will be the biggest impact on Canadians from climate change," says Gordon McBean, assistant deputy to the federal environment minister.
At the 1997 Kyoto climate conference, Canada pledged to reduce its greenhouse emissions by six per cent from 1990 levels by 2008- 2012. But since then, emissions have continued to rise, and there is still no plan for reversing the trend.
REQUIRES CHANGES
Cutting emissions would require major changes in the way Canadians use energy, and would have an impact on virtually every industry. Disruptions in the near term might be high.
"The cost of action to reduce the risk is today, and the cost of inaction is in the future and hence there's a tendency for discounting the costs of inaction," says Henry Hengeveld, a senior adviser on climate change in the Environment Department.
The fossil fuel industry and the Alberta government have denounced the Kyoto commitment as unrealistic, and skeptics continue to find platforms for their views.
Hengeveld, for one, is not discouraged. He expects that the weather itself will settle the quarrel.
"If we are right in our science, and I think we are, nature will remind us from time to time. One of the things that got this on the agenda in 1988 was the extremely hot, dry summer we had that year. I think this is going to happen from time to time again."

Full text:   Approaching 2000
The 1970s were a period of great growth for the city of Prince Albert said local retailer Herschel Davidner. In his recollection, the city's business community evolved with the arrival of new people.
"The downtown used to be a vibrant, thriving retail centre. There were no vacancies," said Davidner. "When the South Hill Mall was built in '72, the retail space in the city was effectively doubled."
It was the beginning of change in the retail sector, said Davidner, one that spelled the end for the downtown shopper.
"When they were talking about building the thing (the mall), I asked myself `Do they expect to have twice the sales with twice the space?"' said Davidner.
Many businesses took to the mall, leaving empty storefronts in the downtown core. Despite the changing face of the city's center, Davidner's Clothing and Western Wear enjoyed favourable sales throughout the '70s.
"We noticed lower sales totals than the previous year for about a year after the mall came in," said Davidner. "Sales gradually returned allowing us to expand our location at the time."
Some retailers didn't weather the climate change as well, said Davidner, with some moving into the new mall and others disappearing all together.
"We used to have three shoe stores on Central Avenue and three high quality menswear retailers," said Davidner. "You can see what's happened to the downtown area. Things have changed and efforts to revitalize have had limited success."
"You didn't see lawyers and insurance agencies on the ground floor," said Davidner. "Second Avenue has become the main drag now and downtown locations that were once prime business locations are going for less money."
Aside from changes to downtown, Davidner said Prince Albert experienced a period of significant growth during the seventies, after seeing the development of the pulp mill and the burning of the last bonded debt in the '60s.
"The pulp mill had a huge impact on the city of Prince Albert," said Davidner.
"The mill poured money into the development of this city and provided jobs for countless people. They have been, and continue to be, a great community member."
With an increase in population brought on by new jobs and new money, existing buildings became crowded and translated into a need for a additional space.
Carlton Comprehensive High School was built onto the Technical High School on Sixth Avenue East in the mid-1970s, said Bill Smiley of the Prince Albert Historical Society, along with other familiar landmarks of today.
"A second police station was built where the Northcote Manor stands in 1974," said Smiley. "The new fire hall was also built on 15th Street East."
The J.M. Cuelenaere Public Library took shape in 1972 shortly after the construction of the Comuniplex and new subdivisions like Crescent Heights, said Smiley.
"There was a lot of new development in the 1970s," said Smiley. "The city was growing rapidly and needed new facilities like schools, high rises and the mall."
Former Herald managing editor Wayne Roznowsky, who worked in the sports department at the time, recalls the decade as devoid of economic worry; a time when employment was plentiful.
"If you didn't like the job you had, you just went and found another one," said Roznowsky. "It was a time of great optimism, you didn't need to worry about what you did or didn't get out of university."
He recounted the opening of the mammoth Carlton Comprehensive as the day the high school dynamic changed for good.
"It (Carlton) pretty much absorbed four other schools and brought the total from five to two; St. Mary and Carlton," he said.
Illustration Photo: Herald file photos / BOOM TOWN -- The 1970s will be remebered by many Prince Albert residents as a time of great growth and change. With low interest rates and a growing population, construction and development was on the rise. With a new mall, schools and housing erupting from the ground, the city skyline would be forever changed. ;

Leading Article: Dawn of a new millennium We have the power. Do we have the wisdom?: [1]

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/leading-article-dawn-new-millennium-we-have-power/docview/245471424/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: There have been billions of dawns since earth was first formed. But, according to the calendar most of us share, with today's dawn the human race enters the third millennium. We may feel awe and humility, and even surprise. For more than two generations we have survived our power to destroy all life while slowly engineering the planet's asphyxiation. Somehow we have made it. The sceptics will say that today's date is only a number; the pedants insist it is not even the right one. But for everyone else, just as the dawn marks the start of a new day, and January 1 announces the start of a new year, so today's dawn opens a new chapter in the human story. We do not wake this morning to a blank slate: there is something deathly in that idea. We wake instead aware of the long past we leave behind. But the turn of the millennium requires us to pause a moment, turn around, and ready ourselves for the future. What will it be? Can we possibly imagine it? The perspective of the lens in space is denied us. The century just gone is too close to disentangle its miracles from its horrors. Even the still beauty of the image is a lie because its gleaming perfection masks the potential for catastrophe. But a millennium offers renewal. `To make an end is to make a beginning," wrote Eliot. `The end is where we start from." Still, there is a question that has to be solved first, one that underpins all the others. If, uniquely among all the creatures on earth, our evolution is in our own hands - thanks to our understanding of our genes and our mastery of our physical environment - what will we do with it? How will we ensure it is just? And this, tough as it may seem, is not a question we can leave to the experts. This is one for all of us. For there is a risk here that, as science accelerates ever faster, our human institutions fail to catch up. We have the brainpower to see how our lives could be improved beyond our dreams, to be rid of much pain and hardship, yet we struggle to spread these new riches fairly. So scientists develop a treatment for Aids which gives those in America or western Europe once written off as the living dead a new chance of life, and yet Aids still kills millions in Africa. This is not because our scientific creativity hits some conundrum it cannot solve in Africa: it is because one part of the planet is so much poorer than the rest. We could be about to repeat the mistake with genetic medicine. The rich countries of the north may discover how to abolish a raft of hereditary diseases forever, but in the south (or among the poor anywhere) those genes could continue to kill. If the new millennium sees us eating from the tree of knowledge, we need to work out how we can share out the fruit. The anxiety we may feel about such things might just be alleviated if the west, which has never been richer or economically more self- confident, began to construct a proper programme of third world aid, as well as taking real action on the vehicle and factory emissions, and the pollution of the seas. If we can decode DNA and invent the internet, we should be able to do pretty much do anything. The experience of the past decade in producing global answers to global problems has not been encouraging. Last month's fiasco in Seattle suggested a fatal dislocation between the ambitions of the developed world and the needs of the developing world. Europe has been at peace for more than half a century, but the struggle to establish successful pan-national governmental structures shows the difficulty of reconciling international aspirations with local cultures. The UN security council has so far been unequal to the task of dealing with the problems thrown up after the collapse of the old communist bloc and the consequent erosions of the 19th and 20th century concepts of state sovereignty. The wars in Kosovo, Bosnia, Rwanda and Chechnya all illustrated the international community's inability to intervene quickly and decisively.

Even the still beauty of the image is a lie because its gleaming perfection masks the potential for catastrophe. But a millennium offers renewal. `To make an end is to make a beginning," wrote Eliot. `The end is where we start from."
Attempting to predict the coming century is more than usually foolish. Even 10 years ago we could not have imagined the internet, the speed of computing (currently doubling every eight or nine months), genetic mapping or cloning. While the mystery of consciousness may elude us for many decades, there are other large areas of our make-up which are about to be revealed. Last month scientists announced the decoding of the first of 23 human chromosomes. It is, as yet, only a rough sketch, but they will be reading the entire genome soon enough, decoding every human characteristic, working out the genes or combinations of genes which are responsible for musicality, schizophrenia, left- handedeness, height, athletic prowess and aggression.
It feels uncannily as though human beings are finally getting to the roots of the tree of knowledge. No wonder today's scientists feel they are living at the most exciting time in history. While Charles Darwin discovered the probability that we evolved by natural selection, we did not understand the mechanics of that change. Soon we will. We are learning from this string of genetic information what life was for our predecessors, how it works for us - and even catch a glimpse of what we might become. In short, we will read the story life is telling us.
This new knowledge will bring untold medical benefits and pose awesome ethical dilemmas. It may be that within two decades traditional surgery will largely be replaced by gene therapy - the injection of chemical messages into diseased or malfunctioning parts of the body. The predisposition to life-threatening diseases in certain patients will also enable doctors to anticipate illness in their patients. The same technology may enable the rich to give their children enormous advantages - enhanced athleticism, height, mathematical ability, the absence of asthma. A scrap of DNA will tell any authority anything they want to know about any person. Who is to determine how this knowledge is used?
It is easy to dwell on our fears. The geniuses of genetics have opened Pandora's box. But people forget the end of the story of Pandora. At the bottom of the box was hope, waiting to break out. Our new ability to eat from the tree of life need not trigger a fall from grace. Take, for example, the fears that the science of genetics would revive the science of eugenics and give intellectual underpinning to crude racism. In fact, advanced genetics teaches us not about the biological origins of our differences, but how strikingly similar we all are to each other. Two groups of chimps found 20 miles apart differ more from each other than one human being does from any other, even those who resemble each other least: our brains are remarkably similar. As we open the book of life during the coming millennium, we should see how much we all share - and how bogus are any notions of racial superiority left over from the last century.
Nor should we blindly fear the prospect of doctors toying with our genes. We need to keep a vigilant eye on what they do, of course, but we can also afford to look forward to a world where diseases such as muscular dystrophy or Huntington's chorea can be tweezed out before they have ruined a life. Would the world really be worse off if those plagues were banished? And if genetics enables human beings to stay alive for longer, and life becomes less of a risk - with less need for the insurance policy of multiple children relied on in the developing world - then perhaps world population might start to fall, easing some of the strain on the planet.
The implications are so vast that we can barely sketch their outline. Where does God, already in retreat after 600 years of modern science, sit in a world where we feel we may one day know the innermost secrets of human existence? Will ours become an entirely godless world? The scientists do not seem to think so. Indeed, some of the most imaginative thinkers speculate that we could eventually discover the concept of right and wrong alongside our genetic instruction manual, that we will realise that the notion of good and evil exists in the universe, as real as the concept of a number: both are real, independent of our perception of them.
Cutting-edge studies of physics - of light, energy and matter - can also feed, rather than choke, our mystical impulses. Now that we can describe the entire physical history of the cosmos for all but the first thousandth of a second, scientists have concluded that, in the words of one, `it looked as if the universe knew we were coming'. Somehow it seemed ready to welcome life. The result is that religion may be different in the new millennium, it may have to speak in a different language, but it will not be dead.
The possibilities are thrilling. Space exploration will continue, reaching beyond our solar system to discover . . . who knows what? Once we have cracked the code for life, will we be able to construct a machine that mirrors it perfectly? Will we crack the riddle of consciousness, so that computers start resembling brains - or will we discover what exactly it is that makes us so different from them? These are just some of the dilemmas that await us.
Still, there is a question that has to be solved first, one that underpins all the others. If, uniquely among all the creatures on earth, our evolution is in our own hands - thanks to our understanding of our genes and our mastery of our physical environment - what will we do with it? How will we ensure it is just? And this, tough as it may seem, is not a question we can leave to the experts. This is one for all of us. For there is a risk here that, as science accelerates ever faster, our human institutions fail to catch up. We have the brainpower to see how our lives could be improved beyond our dreams, to be rid of much pain and hardship, yet we struggle to spread these new riches fairly.

This is not because our scientific creativity hits some conundrum it cannot solve in Africa: it is because one part of the planet is so much poorer than the rest.

The rich countries of the north may discover how to abolish a raft of hereditary diseases forever, but in the south (or among the poor anywhere) those genes could continue to kill. If the new millennium sees us eating from the tree of knowledge, we need to work out how we can share out the fruit.
Our starting point is not easy. We live in a world where economic wealth has grown in ways few ever imagined possible - but where it has become concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. Rich countries such as the US are getting fantastically richer, but the poor ones are not just shut out of the new wealth party: they are getting poorer. Life expectancy, so long assumed to be ever- increasing as man and medicine become more sophisticated, is actually falling in the planet's poorest countries. Genetic research may be discovering the secret of making clever babies in London and New York, but in Mali and Malawi children are going blind for lack of basic eye-cream. If science has put humankind's destiny in our own hands, we are getting it horribly wrong.
In the past 50 years we have been so concerned with the individual rights, with self-expression and personal liberation that we have quite forgotten what we are doing to the planet in this binge of self- gratification. Capitalism becomes more global; so does the threat to the environment. What were once local problems of pollution have now merged into a huge general threat to the planet's delicately balanced ecosystem. The oceans rise along with the steady increase in global temperatures; the atmosphere is more polluted than at any stage in human history; and hundreds of plant and animal species are becoming extinct. Our need for fuel, food and living space increases every day and yet we do not have the slightest inkling of how we are going to cope as the world's population leaps from 6bn today to 10-12bn through the next century
From the industrial revolution until a projected date of 2050, we will have obliterated half the species on earth. Whether it is tiny plants, fungi or insects, we are destroying about 27,000 separate creations a year. It is a programme of devastation unlike anything the globe has witnessed before. Climate change is making the problem worse, with arid areas getting more arid and wet ones getting wetter. Land currently used for farming will become unviable, either too dry or with vital top soil washed away. Some geographers predict a kind of runaway meltdown, as global warming becomes a self-fuelling process, galloping ahead beyond our control. The melting of the glaciers will not solve our other looming problem: a world shortage of water, which could see whole swaths of the Middle East and Asia running dry within 40 years, perhaps warring over H20 the way they once battled for oil.
What can we do about this glaring paradox, which has led us to understand ourselves so profoundly and yet still organise our world so badly? Science can offer some help. It may be that a nudge in the direction of genetic modification will eventually be required to avert a food crisis, compensating for the once fertile areas ruined by global warming. Nanotechnology, the use of tiny robots to perform miniature tasks like microsurgery, could also help: the world will consume fewer resources the more adept we become at manipulating matter. The real answer, however, may be globalisation, since even the most highly developed nations seem incapable of addressing the destruction that is going on. Not the globalisation of the world economy, which currently serves to widen the gap between rich and poor, but a new, as yet unformed idea of globalised politics.
HG Wells saw the point a century ago: he realised that modern problems are worldwide, requiring worldwide solutions. Only a kind of politics which weighs up the needs of the entire human race could begin to address the water question, for example, insisting that the water-rich countries use no more than they need, while the water- poor get no less than they need. At the moment we do nothing because the problem seems too large or the cause too obstinate. This is because the growth of the most developed economies depends on the pillaging of natural resources. It is a global problem which will eventually have to be sorted out by powerful global institutions, rather than national governments. This will be the only way to prevent the Brazilians from burning their rainforest, the Americans from polluting the atmosphere with their factories and the British from dumping nuclear waste in the oceans. Each nation bears a responsiblity for the terrible state of the world's environment at the end of the 20th century, but it is way beyond the powers and will of individual nations to right the damage.
The anxiety we may feel about such things might just be alleviated if the west, which has never been richer or economically more self- confident, began to construct a proper programme of third world aid, as well as taking real action on the vehicle and factory emissions, and the pollution of the seas. If we can decode DNA and invent the internet, we should be able to do pretty much do anything. The experience of the past decade in producing global answers to global problems has not been encouraging. Last month's fiasco in Seattle suggested a fatal dislocation between the ambitions of the developed world and the needs of the developing world. Europe has been at peace for more than half a century, but the struggle to establish successful pan-national governmental structures shows the difficulty of reconciling international aspirations with local cultures. The UN security council has so far been unequal to the task of dealing with the problems thrown up after the collapse of the old communist bloc and the consequent erosions of the 19th and 20th century concepts of state sovereignty. The wars in Kosovo, Bosnia, Rwanda and Chechnya all illustrated the international community's inability to intervene quickly and decisively.
But pessimism should be tempered. The emergence of global consumer power, thanks to the internet, could bring a company like Monsanto to its knees. The web is creating new political communities, scattered across the globe, but working together. To hint that all this might one day lead to a global government, democratically elected, sounds laughable now. If anyone had suggested votes for the masses at the beginning of the 19th century they would have been ridiculed, too. But it happened.
We need to pull off a shift as profound as that modern move to democracy, this time at the global level. And yet we must still remain mindful of the local. A challenge for the new century is to keep alive the belief that individuals can shape the world around them, whether it is the planet or their village. The new technology can be a friend or foe in this process - daunting us with information overload or enabling us to reach out and connect with others. We need to make sure the internet and its allied innovations work for us, not against us.
Where might our own, small island fit into all this? The answer could be quite well. Our mother tongue puts us at the forefront of the web, whose first language is English. We are also neatly situated between the old and new worlds, perfectly placed to be the pivot between Europe and America. In the effort to give birth to a new global awareness, we could be in just the right position. We will need to resolve our dilemma over our relationship with the continent once and for all, and we should do that sooner rather than later. That, in turn, may require a new understanding of Britain itself. In the imperial age it was clear what the union of England, Scotland, Wales and later northern Ireland was for. At the start of the new century, we are much less certain. But we need to work out the purpose of the union if we are not to watch it unravel in the coming decades. Until we do, it is hard to see how we can enter into any other arrangement, with Europe or others, with any self-confidence.
So vast changes are ahead of us, perhaps an unending cascade of them. A new relationship between women and men began to emerge in the past century, at least in the developed world. That process of struggle and debate will continue into the new era. But we should embrace it all. For as the scientists will keep telling us, change is in our nature. We are evolutionary creatures, granted a unique ability to ask questions about ourselves. Indeed, it is this very pursuit of understanding which distinguishes us from the animal. We should cherish this fact about ourselves, just as we cherish the intricate beauty of our existence. To quote Eliot once more: `Last year's words belong to last year's language/And next year's words await another voice.' We are blessed to live now: let us make this a blessed century and a blessed new millennium.

Abstract: There have been billions of dawns since earth was first formed. But, according to the calendar most of us share, with today's dawn the human race enters the third millennium. We may feel awe and humility, and even surprise. For more than two generations we have survived our power to destroy all life while slowly engineering the planet's asphyxiation. Somehow we have made it. The sceptics will say that today's date is only a number; the pedants insist it is not even the right one. But for everyone else, just as the dawn marks the start of a new day, and January 1 announces the start of a new year, so today's dawn opens a new chapter in the human story. We do not wake this morning to a blank slate: there is something deathly in that idea. We wake instead aware of the long past we leave behind. But the turn of the millennium requires us to pause a moment, turn around, and ready ourselves for the future. What will it be? Can we possibly imagine it? The perspective of the lens in space is denied us. The century just gone is too close to disentangle its miracles from its horrors. Even the still beauty of the image is a lie because its gleaming perfection masks the potential for catastrophe. But a millennium offers renewal. `To make an end is to make a beginning," wrote Eliot. `The end is where we start from." Attempting to predict the coming century is more than usually foolish. Even 10 years ago we could not have imagined the internet, the speed of computing (currently doubling every eight or nine months), genetic mapping or cloning. While the mystery of consciousness may elude us for many decades, there are other large areas of our make-up which are about to be revealed. Last month scientists announced the decoding of the first of 23 human chromosomes. It is, as yet, only a rough sketch, but they will be reading the entire genome soon enough, decoding every human characteristic, working out the genes or combinations of genes which are responsible for musicality, schizophrenia, left- handedeness, height, athletic prowess and aggression. It is easy to dwell on our fears. The geniuses of genetics have opened Pandora's box. But people forget the end of the story of Pandora. At the bottom of the box was hope, waiting to break out. Our new ability to eat from the tree of life need not trigger a fall from grace. Take, for example, the fears that the science of genetics would revive the science of eugenics and give intellectual underpinning to crude racism. In fact, advanced genetics teaches us not about the biological origins of our differences, but how strikingly similar we all are to each other. Two groups of chimps found 20 miles apart differ more from each other than one human being does from any other, even those who resemble each other least: our brains are remarkably similar. As we open the book of life during the coming millennium, we should see how much we all share - and how bogus are any notions of racial superiority left over from the last century.

It is, as yet, only a rough sketch, but they will be reading the entire genome soon enough, decoding every human characteristic, working out the genes or combinations of genes which are responsible for musicality, schizophrenia, left- handedeness, height, athletic prowess and aggression.
It feels uncannily as though human beings are finally getting to the roots of the tree of knowledge. No wonder today's scientists feel they are living at the most exciting time in history. While Charles Darwin discovered the probability that we evolved by natural selection, we did not understand the mechanics of that change. Soon we will. We are learning from this string of genetic information what life was for our predecessors, how it works for us - and even catch a glimpse of what we might become. In short, we will read the story life is telling us.
This new knowledge will bring untold medical benefits and pose awesome ethical dilemmas. It may be that within two decades traditional surgery will largely be replaced by gene therapy - the injection of chemical messages into diseased or malfunctioning parts of the body. The predisposition to life-threatening diseases in certain patients will also enable doctors to anticipate illness in their patients. The same technology may enable the rich to give their children enormous advantages - enhanced athleticism, height, mathematical ability, the absence of asthma. A scrap of DNA will tell any authority anything they want to know about any person. Who is to determine how this knowledge is used?
It is easy to dwell on our fears. The geniuses of genetics have opened Pandora's box. But people forget the end of the story of Pandora. At the bottom of the box was hope, waiting to break out. Our new ability to eat from the tree of life need not trigger a fall from grace. Take, for example, the fears that the science of genetics would revive the science of eugenics and give intellectual underpinning to crude racism. In fact, advanced genetics teaches us not about the biological origins of our differences, but how strikingly similar we all are to each other. Two groups of chimps found 20 miles apart differ more from each other than one human being does from any other, even those who resemble each other least: our brains are remarkably similar. As we open the book of life during the coming millennium, we should see how much we all share - and how bogus are any notions of racial superiority left over from the last century.
Nor should we blindly fear the prospect of doctors toying with our genes. We need to keep a vigilant eye on what they do, of course, but we can also afford to look forward to a world where diseases such as muscular dystrophy or Huntington's chorea can be tweezed out before they have ruined a life. Would the world really be worse off if those plagues were banished? And if genetics enables human beings to stay alive for longer, and life becomes less of a risk - with less need for the insurance policy of multiple children relied on in the developing world - then perhaps world population might start to fall, easing some of the strain on the planet.
The implications are so vast that we can barely sketch their outline. Where does God, already in retreat after 600 years of modern science, sit in a world where we feel we may one day know the innermost secrets of human existence? Will ours become an entirely godless world? The scientists do not seem to think so. Indeed, some of the most imaginative thinkers speculate that we could eventually discover the concept of right and wrong alongside our genetic instruction manual, that we will realise that the notion of good and evil exists in the universe, as real as the concept of a number: both are real, independent of our perception of them.
Cutting-edge studies of physics - of light, energy and matter - can also feed, rather than choke, our mystical impulses. Now that we can describe the entire physical history of the cosmos for all but the first thousandth of a second, scientists have concluded that, in the words of one, `it looked as if the universe knew we were coming'. Somehow it seemed ready to welcome life. The result is that religion may be different in the new millennium, it may have to speak in a different language, but it will not be dead.
The possibilities are thrilling. Space exploration will continue, reaching beyond our solar system to discover . . . who knows what? Once we have cracked the code for life, will we be able to construct a machine that mirrors it perfectly? Will we crack the riddle of consciousness, so that computers start resembling brains - or will we discover what exactly it is that makes us so different from them? These are just some of the dilemmas that await us.
Still, there is a question that has to be solved first, one that underpins all the others. If, uniquely among all the creatures on earth, our evolution is in our own hands - thanks to our understanding of our genes and our mastery of our physical environment - what will we do with it? How will we ensure it is just? And this, tough as it may seem, is not a question we can leave to the experts. This is one for all of us. For there is a risk here that, as science accelerates ever faster, our human institutions fail to catch up. We have the brainpower to see how our lives could be improved beyond our dreams, to be rid of much pain and hardship, yet we struggle to spread these new riches fairly. So scientists develop a treatment for Aids which gives those in America or western Europe once written off as the living dead a new chance of life, and yet Aids still kills millions in Africa. This is not because our scientific creativity hits some conundrum it cannot solve in Africa: it is because one part of the planet is so much poorer than the rest. We could be about to repeat the mistake with genetic medicine. The rich countries of the north may discover how to abolish a raft of hereditary diseases forever, but in the south (or among the poor anywhere) those genes could continue to kill. If the new millennium sees us eating from the tree of knowledge, we need to work out how we can share out the fruit.
Our starting point is not easy. We live in a world where economic wealth has grown in ways few ever imagined possible - but where it has become concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. Rich countries such as the US are getting fantastically richer, but the poor ones are not just shut out of the new wealth party: they are getting poorer. Life expectancy, so long assumed to be ever- increasing as man and medicine become more sophisticated, is actually falling in the planet's poorest countries. Genetic research may be discovering the secret of making clever babies in London and New York, but in Mali and Malawi children are going blind for lack of basic eye-cream. If science has put humankind's destiny in our own hands, we are getting it horribly wrong.
In the past 50 years we have been so concerned with the individual rights, with self-expression and personal liberation that we have quite forgotten what we are doing to the planet in this binge of self- gratification. Capitalism becomes more global; so does the threat to the environment. What were once local problems of pollution have now merged into a huge general threat to the planet's delicately balanced ecosystem. The oceans rise along with the steady increase in global temperatures; the atmosphere is more polluted than at any stage in human history; and hundreds of plant and animal species are becoming extinct. Our need for fuel, food and living space increases every day and yet we do not have the slightest inkling of how we are going to cope as the world's population leaps from 6bn today to 10-12bn through the next century
From the industrial revolution until a projected date of 2050, we will have obliterated half the species on earth. Whether it is tiny plants, fungi or insects, we are destroying about 27,000 separate creations a year. It is a programme of devastation unlike anything the globe has witnessed before.

Bradley was Knick, but Gore's the team player: [FINAL Edition]

Author: Lawrence, Jill

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/bradley-was-knick-gores-team-player/docview/408818765/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Bill Bradley was a loner, known for an independence that didn't always go down well at home in New Jersey or in the collegial club that is the U.S. Senate. Al Gore was a team player, a style that worked better as a senator and vice president than as a presidential candidate. * Bradley nearly lost his 1990 bid for a third Senate term from New Jersey to then-newcomer Christie Whitman, who is now the governor. The close call, caused largely by his refusal to take a stand on state tax increases, dissolved Bradley's image as a rising political star heading to greatness. By the time he retired from the Senate in January 1997, he was disillusioned with the political system and out of step with his party's increasingly tough-minded views on welfare.

Full text:   SPECIAL MILLENNIUM EDITION; THE YEARS IN CONGRESS; STYLES; The first primary votes are only a month away. What kind of presidents would the Democratic candidates be? Their contrasting leadership styles offer clues.; See related story: 18A
WASHINGTON
Bill Bradley was a loner, known for an independence that didn't always go down well at home in New Jersey or in the collegial club that is the U.S. Senate. Al Gore was a team player, a style that worked better as a senator and vice president than as a presidential candidate.
The political styles of the two Democrats are as different as their temperaments. Their priorities, legislative skills and relationships all hint at what types of presidents they'd be.
The two do share some political traits. Both are cerebral. Both had fast, stellar starts in Congress. And both have overcome setbacks to make strong White House bids:
* Bradley nearly lost his 1990 bid for a third Senate term from New Jersey to then-newcomer Christie Whitman, who is now the governor. The close call, caused largely by his refusal to take a stand on state tax increases, dissolved Bradley's image as a rising political star heading to greatness. By the time he retired from the Senate in January 1997, he was disillusioned with the political system and out of step with his party's increasingly tough-minded views on welfare.
* Gore clearly enjoys the advantages of incumbency. But as vice president he is naturally overshadowed by President Clinton -- and has been damaged politically by Clinton's scandal-ridden administration. His team spirit, meanwhile, led him to suppress some of his views and express others -- for instance, proclaiming Clinton one of the greatest U.S. presidents right after he'd been impeached.
Different kinds of legislators
In Congress, Gore was the good student who took on complicated issues and studied them for months. "He was the intellectual," says Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., who has worked with Gore on defense and arms control strategy for 20 years. He says Gore, a link to the Reagan administration for House moderates trying to influence U.S. arms control policy, wrote "draft after draft" of articles for prestigious publications.
Gore's strong suit was as a spokesman. In floor speeches, hearings, articles and a book, he drew attention to issues he believed were pressing, including pollution, climate change, organ transplants and problems in the space program.
"In some ways, Gore is more effective working in the glare of the spotlight, and in some ways, Bradley was more effective in the back rooms," says Gregory Wetstone, a senior official at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Bradley, though he got attention when he wanted it, was more involved in nuts and bolts, especially on fiscal and water policy. "As a legislator, I wanted to be a workhorse, not a show horse. The idea was to get things done, pass balls," he says, recalling his trademark as a New York Knick: passing so others could make baskets.
Like Gore, who subjected himself to 13 months of tutorials with an expert aide to master the nuances of nuclear arms, Bradley was an avid student of policy. He joined the Intelligence Committee and became an authority on the U.S.S.R.
The bi-annual Almanac of American Politics praised both men highly. In 1988, authors Michael Barone and Grant Ujifusa said Gore brought to his work seriousness, close study of facts and "an originality of thought that make him a natural leader." They were even more effusive about Bradley. In 1990, they wrote that many Republicans as well as Democrats "think the country would be lucky" if he became president. "He has demonstrated a special strength of character and self-discipline not often seen in politicians and a piercing insight into issues that goes quickly to the heart of the matter."
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., a Bradley backer, says Bradley was influential because "you knew his conclusion would be sound. Many times when he argued, the argument would turn as a consequence of the way he argued it."
Bradley 'on his own'
In the Senate and at home in New Jersey, Bradley kept his own counsel. "He was pretty much a person who did things on his own," says Sen. John Breaux, D-La., a Gore ally who was on the Finance Committee with Bradley.
Some considered Bradley aloof, but others had a more benign take on his reserve. Former senator Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., calls him "a true celebrity" in a glaring spotlight because of his career with the Knicks: "Naturally, you pull back. If you didn't, you'd lose your marbles. I saw him as a shy person."
Bradley says it's important for leaders to have down time. "I don't think you have to be 'on' all the time to be a whole person," he says.
In his final Senate years, Bradley was criticized as disengaged. Some environmentalists say he sat on the sidelines in 1995-96 as Republicans tried to cut back environmental protection laws and agencies. Bradley says he worked to block those moves in committee and in filibusters on the floor.
Bradley also dropped out of a bipartisan group trying to salvage a health-care bill in 1994. He says he left because the others wouldn't agree to a tax break for workers with high-cost health insurance. Breaux, co-leader of the group, says Bradley should have stayed: "If you can't build coalitions and consensus for a policy, how can you be president?"
For Gore, a shaky start
Critics ask a different question of Gore. His campaign has been through a series of shifts as he separates from Clinton and reclaims his political identity. Changes in campaign staff, location, wardrobe and strategy have led some to wonder how he could run the country if he couldn't run a presidential campaign he'd anticipated for years.
Gore says moving his campaign from Washington to Nashville, reducing his staff and trading staged official events for more spontaneous encounters with voters all flowed from his realization that he needed to "establish a clear and direct line of communication with the American people on my own."
Gore says that as he launched his campaign, he was also helping his mother cope with his father's death and "dodging incoming rounds every 30 seconds" as the impeachment process unfolded. "Those aren't justifications for not having perfect pitch politically," he says and then starts to laugh. "I do think that the decision to put the headquarters on K Street (the lawyer-lobbyist heart of Washington) was an atrocious decision." His? "I signed off on it, sure."
It's "probably fair," Gore says, to say the initial setup of his campaign showed "faulty judgment as a politician. But the second half of that has to be I've learned from the experience."
Gore has establishment backing for his candidacy, no surprise given his close ties to party officials and interest groups. Bradley has maintained a distance from the New Jersey and national parties since his first election. "He didn't feel like he really needed the party organization, so he wasn't a part of it," says state Sen. Ray Lesniak, a former state party chairman who supports Gore.
Bradley says he campaigned for 40 Democratic candidates across the country after leaving the Senate and "made sure" a Democrat succeeded him. Lesniak says Bradley campaigned for New Jersey candidates when asked, "but it was not a great effort. It wasn't on a regular basis." When Lesniak chaired the state party in 1992-93, "we really had no interaction at all. There wasn't any hostility there. It was just how it was. That was just his style."

Abstract: Mr. [Gordon E.] Moore soon established Intel Corp., which went on to ride Moore's Law through years of prosperity. The entire world of today's computing -- plunging prices, hotter applications, the advent of the Internet -- is built on the certainty that less will always buy more. Have no fear.

From the time of the earliest electromechanical calculators at the turn of the century (and by some estimates back to the abacus of ancient Babylonia), calculating speed has been increasing at almost precisely the rate that Moore's Law would indicate. And although very few trends continue unabated, this one will. Every advance in computing ensures a further advance because computers are the main tools by which we design computers. Call this trend Moore's Law II. Consider "DNA computing," which is generating intense research world-wide. (It, too, will play a role in Moore's Law II.) First envisioned by mathematician Leonard Adleman of the University of Southern California, it involves infusing a test tube of DNA with trillions of randomly generated DNA strands whose sequences represent all the possible solutions to a problem.

Full text: In a time of terrific upheaval, are there any technology trends you can count on?
The answer is yes. No fewer than five broad movements in technology are virtually certain to remain in force as far into the future as anyone can see. These trends are secular, not cyclical -- the great movements within which lesser technology trends will rise and fall.
What makes these trends so certain? They're rooted in natural laws and biological drives. Most other trends spring from the vicissitudes of culture; these emerge from physical laws and human nature.
A warning: Not every career, corporation or investor embracing these trends will succeed. Far from it. The history of technology is replete with people who had the right idea but the wrong application; who got there first but were blindsided anyway; who caught the wave but lost their balance.
But while following these trends is no assurance of success, it's probably unwise to bet against them.
Moore's Law II
The best-known law of computing was first articulated in the April 19, 1965, edition of the journal Electronics under the heading "Jamming More Components Onto Integrated Circuits." The author, Gordon E. Moore, noted that from 1959 forward, the density of the transistors per square inch of integrated circuit had doubled every year. (Later, he revised the time period to 18 months).
Mr. Moore soon established Intel Corp., which went on to ride Moore's Law through years of prosperity. The entire world of today's computing -- plunging prices, hotter applications, the advent of the Internet -- is built on the certainty that less will always buy more.
But for how long? Mr. Moore and everyone else acknowledge that the gates and pathways of a chip can never shrink beyond the basic unit of electricity, the electron. Many people are concerned that when Moore's Law hits the wall, the heretofore unstinting increase in calculating speed will plateau, and economic growth along with it.
Have no fear. Although he didn't realize it, Mr. Moore was actually describing a trend as old as calculation itself. From the time of the earliest electromechanical calculators at the turn of the century (and by some estimates back to the abacus of ancient Babylonia), calculating speed has been increasing at almost precisely the rate that Moore's Law would indicate. And although very few trends continue unabated, this one will. Every advance in computing ensures a further advance because computers are the main tools by which we design computers. Call this trend Moore's Law II.
Once chips are packed to the physical limits of surface area, how will computers continue improving? In the near term, by expanding into three dimensions, with electrons skittering up and down as well as side to side. Improvements in chip design may also create advances once transistor density hits the wall.
Another near-term improvement involves lashing together great numbers of small computers in ways that create more than the sum of their parts, a method called "massively parallel" computing.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, Calif., already operates such a computer performing two trillion calculations a second. International Business Machines Corp. recently announced a $100 million plan to build a massively parallel machine capable of conducting more than a quadrillion operations a second -- the equivalent of two million of the most powerful desktop PCs operating simultaneously.
In the distance lie quantum computers. Quantum physics describes the duality of the subatomic realm: Sometimes a particle acts like a wave; sometimes a wave acts like a particle. Researchers believe they can harness that duality to act as a bit, which they call quantum bits, or "qubits." Scientists at Los Alamos have used radio waves to activate qubits in simple liquids; already they have succeeded in designing a quantum computer that solves one plus one.
Admittedly that's trifling -- for now. How powerful could a quantum computer be? By some estimates, the subatomic material in a cubic centimeter of salt could execute more instructions than all the computers in the world today.
One consequence of Moore's Law II is the shocking idea that machines may one day outwit humans.
"If I were a hunter -- which I never was much -- I sure as hell would want a smart hunting dog," says Herbert Simon of Carnegie Mellon University, a Nobel laureate in economics and an originator of artificial intelligence some 50 years ago. "So why not with computers? If you have one, let it be smart. We will work out the bargain between us."
Carbon-Silicon Union
Forget the merger of the Web with TV, of phones with computers. The most powerful convergence under way today involves silicon, the substrate of computing, and carbon, the substrate of life. Science author Kevin Kelly calls it the union of "the made and the born." As he puts it, "Machines are becoming biological, and the biological is becoming engineered."
Consider "DNA computing," which is generating intense research world-wide. (It, too, will play a role in Moore's Law II.) First envisioned by mathematician Leonard Adleman of the University of Southern California, it involves infusing a test tube of DNA with trillions of randomly generated DNA strands whose sequences represent all the possible solutions to a problem.
Various chemical techniques eliminate sequences that fail to bind to various partial solutions. The sequence left at the end is the best solution. DNA computing has already solved the famous "traveling salesman" problem, which involves finding the shortest distance for a multicity travel schedule, and is under study as the next wave in encryption and code breaking.
Obstacles abound -- the calculations are error-prone and the DNA proteins fragile -- but by some reckonings a single test tube of genetic material could execute a quadrillion-million instructions per second.
Already in practical use today is the "gene chip." In one application, you unzip a helical strand of DNA containing a defective gene and use an ultraviolet light to etch it onto a glass chip. Then you deposit a patient's DNA on the chip. If it bonds with the etched version, then the sample also contains the defective gene.
"We represent the integration of microelectronics and molecular biology," says Tina Nova, president of Nanogen Inc., a San Diego gene-chip pioneer. She foresees a time when anyone with a sore throat will insert a DNA sample into a home appliance and upload the data for diagnosis.
The made and the born are converging at larger scales as well. A new generation of "smart" prosthetics, using chips that learn the neurology of the user, are sharply reducing the time required to become facile with artificial limbs. Monsanto Corp. is developing plants that produce plastics.
But the most widespread convergence involves the use of life's design principles in the design of computing. One technology involves so-called genetic algorithms, which create random solutions to complex problems, then "breed" the answers until the fittest variant is found. Genetic algorithms are being used to solve complex shop-scheduling problems at Deere & Co., to discover new fuel additives at Purdue University, to create intelligent vehicle controllers at the U.S. Navy, and they are being used in many locations to actually write programs.
And why not? After all, the technology of life has been solving complex problems for more than three billion years.
Intelligence to the Edges
"All intelligence is collective," technology historian George Dyson writes in "Darwin Among the Machines," "...whether that of a billion neurons, a billion microprocessors, or a billion molecules forming a single cell." At the scale of human society, intelligence is devolving from centers and tops and spreading over the widest possible expanse. Technologies that facilitate this migration of intelligence to the edge already rank among the most important of our time.
The Internet, for one, has no intelligent center -- indeed, no center at all. It is pure periphery, yet very smart as a result. Likewise, the mainframe computer, once housed in its tightly sealed glass house and accessible only to a brotherhood of specialized caretakers, has devolved into millions of desktop units, driving intelligence to the edges.
Now, human intelligence is following the path of the machines. In some companies -- DuPont Co. and DaimlerChrysler Corp. are examples -- cross-functional teams and learning networks spring up spontaneously in response to specific problems.
One of the most vivid demonstrations of decentralized human intelligence involves the explosion in "open source" software development. Commercial software developers increasingly place their best work in the public domain, knowing that cadres of programmers will offer ways to improve, refine and debug it.
Sun Microsystems Inc. is giving away the source code for its Jini technology, which permits appliances and computing devices to communicate, to anyone promising to share in whatever improvements they make. In what may be the fastest-growing segment of computing, Web servers run on the open-source Linux operating system, which was developed -- and is still being improved -- by programmers scattered all over the world.
Technologies that restrict the flow of intelligence toward the edges are headed for trouble. Already a backlash is building against popular work-flow systems (generally called "enterprise resource planning," or ERP, systems) that reduce the ability of employees to change how they work.
Picturing Data
Desktop computing exploded with the advent of folders, icons and drag-down menus, those images known collectively as the graphical user interface. It succeeded spectacularly because it transformed massive collections of data into the form most accessible to the human brain: pictures.
We evolved looking at landscapes, objects and each other, not at letters, numbers, and lines of code. Literacy and numeracy succeeded so long as they were simple. The complexities of modern science, society and commerce -- intensified by computers gushing data -- leave us dumbfounded. But computing is now part of the solution as well, thanks to programs that turn data into images, animation, simulations and even games.
Analytical Graphics Inc. of King of Prussia, Pa., sells software that converts imponderable positioning data from satellites into real-time moving pictures seen from any angle or distance. Network administrators of all kinds -- telephone, computer, natural gas, even the back office at the New York Stock Exchange -- watch for patterns and anomalies in data-visualization systems that they could never hope to see in printouts.
In another category, some programs convert inaccessible physical objects to data, and then reconstruct the data into images that are accessible at any scale. Physicians at the Mayo Clinic, for instance, create three-dimensional digital views of a patient's colon, which they can explore from the inside. Engineers at Texaco Inc. look at geological structures deep underground as if they were side-cuts along an interstate highway.
Increasingly, these programs allow executives to play -- and learn -- through "what-if" scenarios, no differently than pilots simulate a variety of flying conditions. TransCanada Pipelines Ltd., one of the largest energy providers in North America, uses complex, data-rich simulations to help natural-gas drillers and shippers coordinate their efforts. Swiss Reinsurance Co., a major reinsurer, uses a graphic simulation called Insurance World to search for risk patterns and to play out the effects of strategies in the marketplace.
Unintended Consequences
Jesse Gelsinger.
His name should rank with Thalidomide, Love Canal and the Ford Pinto as examples of the tragic and unintended consequences that technology can bring. Last September, at age 18, Mr. Gelsinger died in a seemingly uncomplicated procedure in which his liver was injected with genetic material for research on a rare inherited disease.
His disease was no threat to his life. Yet the procedure inexplicably destroyed his lungs in the first death publicly attributed to gene therapy.
At the dawn of the genomics age, it's worth remembering that every technology -- every single one -- bears unintended consequences. Drug makers call them "side effects."
"We can never do merely one thing," the microbiologist Garrett Hardin wrote nearly 40 years ago. "Wishing to kill insects, we may put an end to the singing of birds. Wishing to `get there' faster, we insult our lungs with smog."
But just as technology creates unintended effects, it is our only hope for conquering them. Only technology can widen the field of vision in which we can detect the unintended effects of earlier technologies.
For instance, "now we have models that indicate strongly, very strongly, that the greenhouse effect may well produce large-scale climate change," says Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, who won the Nobel Prize in physics for his discovery of the subatomic quark. "And the models are getting better and better."
To the extent we're blind to technology's unintended consequences, we can be forgiven.
To the extent we ignore them, we're acting unethically.

People, get ready
As we enter the new millennium, a second age of enlightenment could be dawning -- one where the little guy fights back against corporate Big Brother
Friday, December 31, 1999
Special to The Globe and Mail
Vancouver -- To be honest, when I showed up in Seattle last month to watch the WTO circus unfold, I wasn't expecting much from the protesters. I thought they would be the usual rabble-rousing lefty crowd, charged up but not particularly focused, thoughtful or effective.
But as the rolling waves of protesters moved through the downtown core, I changed my mind. These people were passionate, they were having fun, and the signs they carried were sharper than anything I could have thought up. One big placard simply said "WTO" -- except the letters were corporate logos (the golden arches upside-down for "W," the Texaco "T" and the "O"-shaped eye of CBS). It became clear that the vast majority of protesters understood what was fundamentally at stake and what the trade summit really boiled down to: civic culture versus corporate culture. More than that, these folks had found a way to distill the message into potent memes. It's with memes, not bombs or bullets or tear-gas, that the real geopolitical battle of the next century will be fought; and with ground troops like those folks in Seattle, "the people" may just win.
A meme (rhymes with "dream") is a unit of information (a catch-phrase, a concept, a tune, a notion of fashion, philosophy or politics) that leaps from brain to brain. Memes compete with one another and are passed through a population much the same way genes pass through a species. Good strong memes can change minds, alter behaviour, catalyze collective mindshifts and transform cultures. In our information age, whoever has the memes has the power.
For about 40 years, corporations have had the power. They've been beaming their memes into our brains at the rate of about 3,000 marketing messages per day (that includes all the ads you see on TV, on your computer screen, in magazines, on radio, billboards, plus all the brands and logos on buildings, T-shirts, appliances, etc.). This onslaught -- arguably the biggest psychological experiment ever carried out on the human race -- has affected us profoundly. The food we eat, the cars we drive, the way we feel about our bodies, our sexuality, what music we think is cool, have all been shaped by the billions of pro-consumption memes dumped into our collective subconscious daily.
But lately, counter memes -- of the sort seen in Seattle -- have appeared more frequently in the mindscape: fashion billboards "liberated" by creative editors with spray cans; a burping pig on a TV ad chastizing North Americans for consuming too much; a bumper sticker that asks: "Is Economic Progress Killing the Planet?"
The meme warrior's best friend is, of course, the Internet. Last year, the multilateral agreement on investment initiative was killed largely by the spread of anti-MAI sentiment across the Net. Hundreds of thousands of people E-mailed their friends, set up Web sites, held virtual protests and found ways to hack into and jam corporate sites.
A resistance movement against Monsanto Co. and genetically modified foods has gained strength on the Net. The outrage against GM started in the United Kingdom (where folks spooked by mad-cow disease weren't wild about further human experimentation), then spread worldwide. Word memes like "Frankenfoods" and visual memes depicting the bizarre genetic mutations in our future struck a chord. Many months before "The Battle in Seattle," the core issues were hotly debated on the Net.
I believe the next few years will see an intensification of meme warfare throughout our mental environment. Which is to say, not in the sky or on the streets, and not in the forests or around international fishing boundaries as in earlier eras, but in newspapers and magazines, on the radio, on TV and in cyberspace. This global guerrilla information war will be a no-holds barred propaganda battle of competing world views and alternative visions of the future.
The most critical areas will involve the sovereignty of individual citizens and of nations against the sovereignty of corporations. Here are what I find to be the three most potent metamemes currently in the social activist's arsenal:

  

Metameme 1:

  



  

No Corporate "I"

  



  

This is the idea that corporations are not "persons" with constitutional rights and freedoms of their own but legal fictions that we ourselves created and must therefore control.
Are corporations legitimate agents of progress or merely generators of shareholder-profit at the planet's expense? Should transnationals like Monsanto and Time Warner Inc. have the power to challenge the laws of sovereign nations? In the next century, will a handful of giant corporations dominate every industry? Will corporations rule the world? Or is this just a clever lefty pseudo-meme? That's the mind-field we must negotiate.
If my reading of "The Battle in Seattle" is correct, the next 10 years will be a period of intense corporate-bashing. Corporations like Philip Morris Cos. Inc. will be pushed to the wall. Aggressive megacorps like Monsanto that think they can "SLAP suit" -- prevent criticism via libel chill -- the world into their kind of nutritional agenda will suffer. (SLAPP is an acronym for "strategic lawsuit against public participation.") Any upcoming MAI or WTO trade initiatives are doomed. A visceral, Net-centred reaction against corporate bigness is under way.
At stake is the very legitimacy of corporations, their "personhood" under the law. Should corporations have legal rights and freedoms under the Constitution like we human beings do, or should they be subordinate legal entities with no inherent rights?
If enough people pick up on the No Corporate "I" meme and start relating to corporations in new, more rambunctious ways, then our business culture will change in profound ways.
For one, there will be harsh, new corporate criminal liability laws. Corporate lawbreakers will not be allowed to bid for government contracts or hold television licences; they will be barred from lobbying activities and financing political campaigns. Companies that dump toxic wastes, damage watersheds, fix prices, exploit employees or keep vital information secret from customers, will pay huge penalties. Rogue corporations that willfully break the law will have their charters revoked, their assets sold and the money funnelled into superfunds for their victims.
Rules of incorporation will be rewritten so that shareholders assume partial liability for the companies they own. They will continue to reap the rewards when the going is good and share prices are rising, but they will have to share the responsibility when the company they own becomes criminally liable.
This one simple mind shift in the way we think about shareholders will transform stock markets. Fewer shares will be traded. Instead of simply choosing the biggest cash cows, shareholders will carefully investigate the backgrounds of the companies they are about to sink their money into. They'll think twice about buying shares in Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. or Monsanto. Too risky. They'll buy into resource companies with good environmental records. They'll stay away from multinationals that use child workers or break labour laws overseas.
In other words, shareholders will be "grounded" -- forced to take responsibility. Stock markets will cease to be gambling casinos. Our whole business culture will heave.

  

Metameme 2:

  



  

Media carta

  



  

This is the idea that every human being has the "right to communicate" -- to receive and impart information through any media.
In 1995, Adbusters Media Foundation (the non-profit organization that I co-founded) launched a Canadian Charter legal action against the CBC for refusing to sell us airtime for our social marketing TV messages. Those 30-second spots included "Obsession Fetish" (a critique of the fashion industry featuring a bulimic Kate Moss look-alike) and "Buy Nothing Day" (a call for a consumer fast every Nov. 26). The case wound its way through the courts until the Supreme Court of Canada threw it out in 1998. We are now trying to take it to the World Court or the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
Earlier eras had their critical human-rights battles. In this information age, we need to fight for a new right -- one many of us assumed we already had: the right to communicate. This new measure would, for example, give every citizen the right to walk into their local TV station and buy 30 seconds of airtime for a message he or she believes in.
We must fight for potent, practical mechanisms for citizen access to the airwaves. I like the idea of a "two-minute media revolution" in which the CRTC, when granting broadcast licences, is obliged to give two minutes of every broadcast hour back to the people for citizen use.
Antitrust lawsuits, such as the U.S. Attorney-General's suit against Microsoft, can also be an effective way to break up media megacorporations. If enough fed-up citizens demanded a freer, more diverse cultural environment, the U.S. and Canadian governments could be pressured to go after Time Warner, News Corp. and Disney, and limit the number of TV stations, newspapers and radio stations each is allowed to own.
The ultimate goal of course, is to break the commercial monopoly of TV and create a free marketplace of ideas where competing memes and visions of the future battle it out every night on prime time.
Media Carta is the great human-rights battle of our information age. At stake is our ability to create our own culture from the bottom up, instead of having it spoon-fed to us top down by a corporate-owned and -operated media. Maybe Canadians can be the first nation to enshrine "the right to communicate" as a fundamental human right in our Charter of Rights and Freedoms?

  

Metameme 3:

  



  

The True-Cost Marketplace

  



  

In the global marketplace of the future, the price of every product will tell the ecological truth.
Progressive economists and the activist left continue to push for various "eco" and "carbon" taxes that would punish polluters by hitting them in the wallet. In my opinion, this approach is short-sighted. I say, let's have an across-the-board pricing system that tells the ecological truth and let the marketplace sort things out.
Take the personal car. More than any other product, the automobile is a symbol of the need for a true-cost marketplace, in which the price you pay reflects all the costs of production and operation. That doesn't just mean paying the manufacturing cost plus markup, plus oil, gas and insurance. It means paying for the pollution, for building and maintaining the roads, for the medical costs of accidents and the noise and the esthetic degradation caused by urban sprawl. It means paying for traffic policing and perhaps even for the military protection of oil fields and supply lines.
The true cost of a car must also include the real but hard-to-estimate cost to future generations of dealing with the oil depletion and climate change the car is creating today. If we add up the best available estimates, we'd come to a startling conclusion: The fossil-fuel-based automobile industry is being subsidized by unborn generations to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars every year.
In the true-cost marketplace of the future, no one will prevent you from driving. You'll simply have to pay the real price of piloting your tonne of metal around, spewing carbon out of the tailpipe every year. Your private automobile will cost you, by some estimates, about $100,000. And a tankful of gas, $250.
Moving over a 15-year period toward true-cost driving would force us to reinvent the way we get around. When the majority of people can no longer afford to drive, enormous public demand for monorails, bullet trains, subways and streetcars would emerge. Automakers would design eco-friendly alternatives: vehicles that recycle their own energy, human-and-fuel powered hybrids, lightweight solar vehicles. Citizens would demand more bike lanes, pedestrian paths and car-free downtowns.
A paradigm shift in urban planning would ensue. About 10 years into the transition period, personal automobiles would become more trouble than they're worth. People would start enjoying their calmer lifestyles and the new psycho-geography of their cities.
In a true-cost marketplace, the price of a pack of cigarettes will include the extra burden it places on our health-care system; the price of an avocado will reflect the real cost of flying it thousands of kilometres to your supermarket; the cost of nuclear energy (if indeed we can afford it) will include the estimated cost (and risk) of storing the radioactive waste in Earth's crust for millions of years.
True-cost is a solution almost all political persuasions can sort of agree with. Conservatives like the idea because it's a logical extension of their free-market philosophy. Progressives like it because it involves a radical restructuring of the status quo. Governments like it because it gives them a vital new function to fulfill: that of calculating the true-costs of products, levying eco-taxes and managing our bio-economic affairs for the long term. And environmentalists like it because it may be the only way to achieve sustainability in our lifetimes.
As the millennium turns, I think we're on the verge of a great global mind shift -- a transformation of human affairs comparable in scale to the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. On the eve of this turn, I propose a toast: Cheers! Prosit ! Kanpai ! Hallelujah! May the best memes win.

Toronto -- -*** This series asks what it would take to make Toronto a more liveable city.

  



  

Monday: What if . . . Toronto were a city within a park?

  



  

Tuesday: What if. . . Toronto were a family-friendly city?

  



  

Yesterday: What if . . . Toronto were more accessible to cyclists?

  



  

Today: What if . . . Toronto had the weather of Washington, D.C.?

  



  

Tomorrow: What if . . . Toronto reduced its reliance on cars?

  

-***

  

Light rain will taper off by mid-morning with temperatures reaching 12 to 14 degrees Celsius. Expect mild weather overnight and for much of the next three to four months.
No, it's not a cruel joke, rather an almost certain forecast of Toronto's mid-December climate 50 years from now.
Climate in the greater Toronto area is warming at a rate double the global average, Environment Canada says. In the future, weather in Toronto will be more like the present climate of Washington than like a northern city in the shadow of the snow belt.
"This is where the people are, the foundations of our economy. The GTA will get the greatest impact of climate change from a human perspective," said Quentin Chiotti, who is working on a study of atmospheric change in the Toronto and Niagara region.
The warming trend is expected to alter many features of Toronto's infrastructure, environment and cultural life.
To see a bit of the future, look no further than Washington, which has only one or two minor snowfalls in winter and sees temperatures that reach well into the 30s in summer.
"It's December and I'm still playing tennis on an outdoor court," said Dorn McGrath, a professor of urban and regional planning at George Washington University in Washington.
Torontonians may have to say farewell to most outdoor skating rinks and snow shovels. They also may say hello to longer golf and construction seasons, bigger beaches and lower heating bills. Snowmobiling and other wintertime activities are expected gradually to disappear.
"The wildlife could rest in peace in the wintertime again," joked Henry Hengeveld, an adviser on climate at Environment Canada.
He said that the city will have less snow in winter and more intense thunderstorms, sunshine and downpours in summer. The average temperature will increase by four to five degrees in summer and at least that much in winter. "The snow-removal budget will [need to be] almost nonexistent," Mr. Hengeveld said. But money saved will likely be money spent on intermittent bouts of extreme weather, which are expected to increase.
Heat waves could burden the health-care system. As temperatures soar, air quality worsens, smog increases and the elderly and young are more vulnerable to illness, Mr. Hengeveld said.
Health costs are expected to be offset by a warmer climate. The highest mortality from weather in Canada is because of the cold.
In Washington, severe air-pollution problems have erupted in the past five years. Prof. McGrath said warm temperatures and a high number of motorists are to blame. "People are anguishing sufficiently over this," he said.
In the Toronto area, an even more pressing weather concern is expected to arise. "The key concern for Southern Ontario is the drought issue. There will be a need for water management," Mr. Hengeveld said.
With the higher temperatures, the growing season will be longer, providing the potential for more abundant crops. But irrigating the land regularly won't be easy, he said.
The supply of water is expected to decrease, while demand for water, to generate electricity and to farm, is likely to increase.
Environment Canada predicts levels of lakes, including the Great Lakes, will shrink one metre in the next 50 to 100 years.
Heavily laden boats may have difficulty moving through canals and ports. "Boats would have to carry lighter loads and take more trips, which is expensive," said Linda Mortsch, a researcher at the Faculty of Environmental Studies at the University of Waterloo.
However, warmer winters mean the shipping season could be extended because ice won't cover the Great Lakes or the St. Lawrence Seaway for very long.
Also, as the depth of lakes decreases, the size of beaches increases, said Ms. Mortsch. "You will have to walk farther from your dock to your boat."
The change in water temperature and depth will gradually replace trout and whitefish in local lakes with fish that prefer warm, poor-quality water, such as carp. And as temperatures and rain increase in the GTA, more mosquitoes are expected to move into the region, attracted by damp areas in which they can lay their eggs. Malaria might arise in Southwestern Ontario, Mr. Hengeveld said.
An increase in the incidence of severe storms and floods is cause for worry, said Paul Kovacs, executive director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction, which is funded largely by the University of Western Ontario. "We believe the people in Toronto are quite vulnerable to extreme weather," he said.
The first storm that exceeded the cost of $100-million occurred 10 years ago in Calgary. The price of extreme weather has skyrocketed since then. Last year, Montreal's ice storm cost $2.5-billion; of that, $1.4-billion was covered by insurance.
Floods are of particular concern because they are not covered by insurance. To reduce costs from flooding, infrastructure must be adapted to handle larger amounts of rainfall. Sewer pipes could be widened and storm sewers deepened to hold more water, Mr. Kovacs said.

Full text:   824. The theme of the White House millennium activities is "Honor the Past - Imagine the Future."
823. In the town of Woodbury, N.J., a millennium project will link the city to its English roots. In the spring of 2000, a 112- foot replica of a 1725 brig, the Phoenix, will retrace the historic journey of Henry Wood, a Quaker from Bury who is credited with founding Woodbury.
822. Some 40 million pilgrims, visitors and tourists are expected to converge on Rome during the year 2000.
821. Ed Woodyard booked his room for New Year's Eve 1999 back in 1983 while the Marriott Marquis in Times Square was still under construction. Woodyard explained that he wanted to relive a memorable New Year's Eve as a child in Times Square.
820. Remember: Pets, alcoholic beverages and weapons are not permitted in American Red Cross shelters.
819. Public shelters should be your last resort. Try staying at a friend's house or a local hotel.
818. If a disaster catches you without a supply of clean water, you can use the water in your hot-water tank, pipes and ice cube trays. As a last resort, you can use the water in the reservoir tank of your toilet (not the bowl).
817. Two ways to purify water: Boiling and disinfection. Boil water for three to five minutes and let cool before drinking. Or add 16 drops of household bleach per gallon of water. Let stand for 30 minutes before using. Do not use scented bleach, color-safe bleach or bleach with added cleaners.
816. Listen to the radio or get a battery-operated television for the latest information.
815. If the electricity goes off, eat perishable food from the refrigerator first.
816. Then, eat the foods from the freezer. To minimize the number of times you open the freezer door, post a list with the freezer contents. In a well-filled, well-insulated freezer, foods usually will have ice crystals in their centers (meaning the food is safe to eat) for three days.
815. Finally, begin to use non-perishable foods and staples.
814. Conventional wisdom has it that Saturday will be the start of a new millennium, but some argue it won't really start until Jan. 1, 2001. Here's why: The sixth-century monk who concocted the calendar we use today didn't factor in a year "zero". That means we went straight from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D. In order for the current millennium to end at the stroke of midnight Friday, the first century would have had only 99 years.
813. Seminole County has spent $1.3 million during the last three years expanding and upgrading its technology with Y2K-compliant systems.
812. Residents can ask Seminole County officials Y2K-related questions on New Year's Eve by calling 407-665-2650, 407-665-2651 or 407-665-2652.
811. Successful Y2K tests were performed in June on Seminole County traffic signals along U.S. Highway 17-92 from First Street to Button Road, and along Lake Mary Boulevard from Markham Woods Road to Hidden Lake Drive, and at two intersections on County Road 46A and another two on Sanford Avenue.
810. Seminole County has considered itself Y2K-compliant since July.
809. Al Hill will lose his status as Seminole County's Y2K coordinator after New Year's Eve. In 2000, he will return to his full- time job as manager of the county's geographical information system.
808. Three older fax machines in Seminole County will continue to work, but will print a partial date of "00" instead of "2000" on faxes received after midnight Friday.
807. There are 80 terms in a Y2K glossary on the federal government's consumer-issues Web page at www.consumer.gov/y2k/.
806. The phrase "computer bug" originated years ago in the United States when "inexplicable faults" were traced to moths found flying inside faulty computers .
805. Debugging is the process of finding and removing the causes of failures in software and has nothing to do with removing moths from computers.
804. If you want to spend New Year's Eve at your favorite International Drive attraction, you may be out of luck. Several attractions are closing early, so call ahead.
803. European visitors can celebrate the New Year on their own time at Lucky Leprechaun Irish Pub. Lucky Leprechaun is hosting two New Year's celebrations - one at 7 p.m. for European tourists and another at midnight for Americans.
802. Dinner attractions such as Medieval Times and King Henry's Feast are charging some princely sums for their special New Year's Eve packages. King Henry's adult tickets are $90 for its 9 p.m. show compared with a regular admission price of $37.95. Medieval Times tickets are $92.95 for the 9:30 show compared with $39.95 regular admission. Call ahead or you could come up short.
800. Y2K will begin at 6 a.m. our time in New Zealand.
799. George Orwell's book 1984 was published 35 years earlier, in 1949. Stanley Kubrick's movie 2001: A Space Odyssey was released 33 years earlier, in 1968. Prince's album 1999 was released 17 years earlier, in 1982.
798. Jazz great Louis Armstrong, who died in 1971, would have turned 100 in 2000. Same goes for actress Helen Hayes, who died in 1993.
797. Officials with Florida Power Corp. and Florida Power and Light sent a mixed signal when trying to assure the public that their nuclear reactor facilities are Y2K-compliant. They said most of the technology in the reactors is so old that Y2K issues won't be affected.
796. Go see a Magic game and watch the potential NBA Coach of the Year in action.
795. If you're thinking about swinging into the new year at Atlantic Dance Hall on Disney's BoardWalk, forget about it. Its 1940s- style New Year's Eve celebration sold out a few weeks ago.
794. Looking for a cozy first meal of the new millennium? For the best romantic dinner spot in Orlando, Sentinel restaurant critic Scott Joseph recently chose Delfino Riviera at the Portofino Bay Hotel at Universal Studios Escape. Call 407-503-1000 for reservations.
793. Before you go back to work, brush up on your rights on the job. Read Your Workplace Rights (Amacom, $22.95) by Robert Gregory.
792. Review the deposit insurance coverage of your credit union account if you have a lot of money in savings. Check with your credit union or the National Credit Union Administration at 703-518-6330.
791. Consumers can get general information on Y2K by calling the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion at 1-888-USA-4-Y2K.
790. Web junkies should get in as much surfing as they can this week and plan to take a break on New Year's Eve.
788. Stock up on CDs and a few good books.
787. Consider sending important mail certified or registered, to have a record of when you mailed it.
786. Use sunscreen.
785. Better brush up on that hygiene: When asked what will pose the greatest threat to human health in the next century, environmentalist Eugene Linden, author of The Future in Plain Sight: Nine Clues to the Coming Instability, says it is infectious disease. As he sees it, when the biosphere becomes unbalanced from pollution, climate change and human intervention, new infectious diseases - and virulent strains of older ones thought conquered - will be a major threat.
784. Be sure to protect electronic gizmos. Surges and brownouts that could accompany interruptions in electrical service could damage delicate equipment such as computers.
783. Millennium celebrations in China will center on the capital of Beijing, where a "China Century Altar" will be erected. The altar will be a mix of traditional and modern Chinese culture and art.
782. In addition to a New Year's Eve party in Brazil, the group Viva Rio is promoting a 72-hour ceasefire in the 600 slums of Rio de Janeiro. It is a climax to months of local grassroots action and community policing.
781. After conducting a massive audit, federal regulators say more than 99 percent of the nation's financial institutions, automated- teller-machine vendors and service providers are Y2K compliant.
780. A majority of the nation's chief information officers and other executives plan to have plenty of cash on hand in case financial glitches hit when New Year arrives, according to a recent survey by CIO magazine.
779. Using global communications links, the president's Y2K council plans to be a zone-by-zone clearinghouse for information about what is happening around the world. Banks, utilities, multinational companies and other national governments will be feeding information to the White House Y2K communications center, which will become active Tuesday.
778. The FDIC has set up a consumer hotline (1-800-934-3342) to answer questions about Y2K.
777. The task force also is warning the public about callers offering to move your money into a Y2K-safe account, asking for your account number and other personal information.
776. And watch out for pollsters asking personal questions about how you'll prepare for Y2K. The callers are looking for people hoarding cash - likely targets of a burglary.
775. Throughout the world, 2000 will roll like a wave through the time zones, starting in the far West. If things go wrong with certain systems elsewhere, experts in the United States hope to find out soon enough to fix the same type of systems here or implement backup plans.
774. Officials at Orlando International Airport will monitor major airports in Europe and Asia to see what type of problems occur there. OIA also will pass its information on to airports three hours behind in California.
773. Y2K planners are less concerned about potential personal- computer problems and more concerned about so-called embedded systems - internal computer chips that control equipment such as elevators, factories or building systems. Embedded electronics are more difficult to evaluate and test for Y2K problems.
772. The U.S. Commerce Department estimates that the cost of the United States' battle with Y2K will exceed $100 billion.
771. The American Hospital Association says the nation's hospitals have spent about $8 billion to ensure their computers, medical equipment and electronics will not be affected by Y2K.
770. Releasing his report on Y2K and the economy, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said he foresees minor problems but no lasting overall economic damage from the millennium bug.
769. The National Institute of Standards in Technology - one of the federal government's lead agencies for helping manufacturers - says less than 30,000 of the estimated 380,000 small U.S. factories have obtained the agency's free Y2K-solution self-help kits.
768. Cheap Trick will "Party through the Decades" at Disney-MGM Studios along with LFO and Big Time Operator on Friday from 9 a.m.-2 a.m.

Full text: Looking Back on a Century
Gordon Toole remembers the day it was so cold that spit froze before it hit the ground.
Toole was one of about 20 men working at a military airport at Snag, Yukon, when the temperature plunged to the deepest low ever recorded in North America.
"You can't breathe through your nostrils in air that temperature, it's almost as though they're blocked or frozen," he says from Snag, about 320 kilometres northwest of Yellowknife. "You have to breath through your mouth but they're shallow breaths.
"You cannot take deep breaths because they just catch in your throat, you're gasping."
The temperature was so low it couldn't be recorded on a mercury thermometer. Even in an alcohol thermometer, the liquid sank below the lowest temperature mark, settling into the bulb at the bottom.
They marked the point with a small file -- a pen wouldn't work -- and sent the thermometer to Toronto. Days later the reading was confirmed: - 62.2C.
The record set at Snag on Feb. 3, 1947, still stands. For Canadians who seemingly never get tired of talking about the weather, it's a classic tale, especially since there were no casualties and no real damage.
Recent years have seen many weather extremes that were not so benign.
Few residents of Eastern Canada have forgotten the ice storm in 1998, when millions shivered in darkened houses or sought refuge in crowded public shelters.
Few residents of Manitoba have forgotten the flood of 1997, when the Red River turned into a vast sea, driving some 28,000 people from their homes and submerging whole towns.
The Saguenay Flood of 1996 caused massive damage, as did the Calgary hail storm of 1997. Unpredictable Prairie weather has helped reduce Canada's breadbasket to a basket case as the year 2000 nears.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimates that insurance payments for extreme weather events across the country have been doubling every five to 10 years. Payouts last year reached $1.5 billion.
"The weather in Canada has been frightful," says Paul Kovaks, a spokesman for the bureau.
Munich Re of Munich, Germany, one of the world's biggest reinsurance companies, estimates global losses from weather-related natural disasters have increased to $90 billion annually from $7 billion to $8 billion annually in the 1980s.
Part of the rising toll results from population growth -- there's simply more property to be damaged, and more of it is built in risky areas like flood plains and coastlines.
Paradoxically, modern technology can also increase vulnerability to extreme weather since vital energy and communications systems across large areas are intertwined.
"The disaster is the event plus our vulnerability," says federal climatologist Roger Street. "Higher dependence on networked energy, higher dependence on telecommunications, makes us more vulnerable."
The favourite scapegoat for strange meteorological goings on in the 1990s has been El Nino, a periodic warming of the southern and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, or its twin sister La Nina, a cooling current in the same area.
Climatologist David Phillips says in his recent book Blame it on the Weather that El Nino has become the scapegoat for everything from whale beachings in China to increased crime in Saskatoon.
But using the El Nino as a scapegoat merely pushes the mystery to a deeper level. Why has El Nino been causing so much more trouble than it used to?
Records show El Nino events have been getting stronger since the late 1970s, with the most severe events on record occurring in 1982- 83 and in 1997-98. The longest El Nino on record lasted from 1990 to mid-1995.
Is El Nino a messenger for something much bigger?
Few credible scientists dispute that the climate is warming: the finding has been confirmed by countless studies. There has been great debate about whether the trend is due to natural variability or human influence. Now that debate also seems to be settled.
Over the past century, the average temperature of earth has risen by close to one degree Celsius. Now the big controversy concerns how fast future warming will occur and how it will affect different regions.
Much of the research is done with computer models simulating the atmosphere -- programs so complex that they push existing hardware to its limits. The models have many warts but they're getting better.
"There's some uncertainty, but I feel much safer, much more confident making a weather forecast for the year 2090 than I do an economic or a demographic or a political kind of forecast," says Phillips of the federal Environment Department's atmospheric environment service.
For example, the models show a balmy future for Toronto: "What Kentucky has now is what in fact Toronto will inherit in terms of its climate probably a hundred years from now.
"We've warmed up Toronto by maybe 0.6 of a degree and now we're talking about warming in the summertime of four to five degrees, five to nine degrees in the winter. There's going to be really a leap forward in terms of the climate."
Canadians may welcome the prospect of milder winters, but what about the prospect of more frequent and severe droughts, floods and storms?
"It is extreme events that will be the biggest impact on Canadians from climate change," says Gordon McBean, assistant deputy to the federal environment minister.
At the 1997 Kyoto climate conference, Canada pledged to reduce its greenhouse emissions by six per cent from 1990 levels by 2008- 2012. But since then, emissions have continued to rise and there is still no plan for reversing the trend.
Cutting emissions would require major changes in the way Canadians use energy, and would have an impact on virtually every industry. Disruptions in the near term might be high.
"The cost of action to reduce the risk is today, and the cost of inaction is in the future and hence there's a tendency for discounting the costs of inaction," says Henry Hengeveld, a senior adviser on climate change in the Environment Department.
The fossil fuel industry and the Alberta government have denounced the Kyoto commitment as unrealistic, and skeptics continue to find platforms for their views.
Hengeveld, for one, is not discouraged. He expects that the weather itself will settle the quarrel.
"If we are right in our science, and I think we are, nature will remind us from time to time. One of the things that got this on the agenda in 1988 was the extremely hot, dry summer we had that year. I think this is going to happen from time to time again."

Full text:   With the opening of Parliament yesterday, Governor-General Sir Michael Hardie Boysdelivered the speech outlining the Government's programme for the next three years.This is an edited version of that speech.
--------------------
`Getting a good start is crucial. The first step will be to fund the Plunket Lineservice on a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week basis'.
--------------------
NEW ZEALAND remains over-dependent on the production and exporting of commodities.At the same time, New Zealand's skills production in those areas relevant to thenew knowledge-based industries has been inadequate.
My Government is determined to address these structural failings in order to improvereal incomes and provide the means to restore our social services to being amongthe best in the world.
Overall responsibility for the delivery of a new business development programme willbe with a new organisation, Industry New Zealand. The minister for economic developmentwill be moving quickly to set up Industry New Zealand.
Industry New Zealand will have the role of providing policy advice on strategic economicdevelopment issues as well as programmes in enterprise financing, local economicdevelopment, innovation, workplace productivity, ecological sustainability and procurementpolicy.
My Government will provide new assistance for exporters. New Zealand needs to seegreater reciprocity from some of our trading partners on tariff reductions, and amore considered and balanced approach to tariff reduction will be taken.
My Government is committed to putting New Zealand Superannuation on a sound and fairbasis for the long term. The level of payment in relation to other incomes will berestored to that agreed in the multi- party accord in 1993. There will be discussionson moving to a dedicated tax and fund basis for New Zealand Superannuation. Measuresto improve private savings will also be considered, including reducing compliancecosts and providing an alternative tax regime to encourage superannuation savings.
A broad structural review of the taxation system will be undertaken. The review willtake into account the promotion of sustainable growth and increased equity. An independentreview will also be undertaken of the operation of monetary policy since the passingof the Reserve Bank Act in 1989.
My Government will replace the Employment Contracts Act with fairer and more balancedemployment relations legislation. This legislation will preserve the freedom to choosewhether or not to join a union. It will mandate good faith bargaining. The minimumcode will be reviewed and strengthened. Greater enforcement will be undertaken ofthe provisions of the minimum code to ensure they are not flouted. Discussions willtake place in order to institute a new system of paid parental leave.
Getting a good start in life is crucial to later success. My Government will expandearly intervention programmes. The first step will be to fund the Plunket Line serviceon a 24-hour-a-day, seven- days-a-week basis. Increased assistance will be made availableto the early childhood education sector. My Government will require teacher registrationand ongoing professional development in this sector. Eventually, the Government willneed to turn its attention to the question of pay parity for kindergarten teachers.Kindergartens will also be returned to the state sector.
In the compulsory education sector, bulk funding will end and funding budgeted forit will be redistributed to all schools on a fair basis. Homework centres will betrialled to boost educational achievement. The training and professional developmentof teachers will be improved. Problems with the provision of special education serviceswill be tackled. Incentives will be provided to attract staff to rural schools.
In post-compulsory education a new Apprenticeship Act will be introduced. Amendedindustrial training legislation will be passed to encourage continuous upskillingof the workforce. The present competitive model in tertiary education will be abandoned,and a tertiary education commission will be set up to begin rebuilding a collaborativeand cooperative tertiary sector. Interest will not be charged on student loans forfulltime and other low-income students while they study. It is my Government's intentionto fund tertiary education providers at a level sufficient to enable fees to be reducedover time.
Research funding will be increased. Business investment in research, particularlyby small and medium-sized firms, will be encouraged through the establishment ofa small-business research fund.
The most important need is to boost research in science and technology. A high levelScience and Innovation Advisory Council will be established to report to the primeminister to ensure that this occurs.
My Government will change the taxation regime to ensure that it is more favourablein its treatment of research and development costs. This will be accompanied by areview of the depreciation regime to encourage investment in new plant and equipment.
A royal commission into genetic modification will be established. Until it has reported,a moratorium will be imposed on the commercial planting of genetically modified crops.A simple and comprehensive system of labelling genetically modified food will berequired.
The proposed amendments to the Resource Management Act at present before the Housewill be revisited. Amendments which weaken the act will be dropped. Those that donot will proceed. Issues of cost, delay and unevenness in implementation of the actwill be addressed.
By 2010, all waste management shall be on a full cost recovery basis and all existinglandfills will be upgraded or closed. It is my Government's objective to reduce significantlythe waste stream.
Measures that will be taken to control greenhouse gases will include an inquiry intothe impact of climate change and ozone depletion, increased public education programmes,greater investment in public transport and stronger measures on energy efficiency.
My Government will nurture much stronger music, publishing and film industries throughassistance with financing investment, export development and promotion. Format-specificquotas will be introduced for local content on radio and free-to-air television.The National Library and the National Archives will be strengthened. Copyright protectionwill be enhanced. Parallel importing of CDs, videos, films, books and software willbe prohibited for up to two years after first release.
A New Zealand Music Commission will be established to encourage the development ofthe music industry. New initiatives will provide better support for established artists,community arts, and emerging artists. The aim is to expand job opportunities andwealth creation based on the arts as well as to promote New Zealand's identity. RadioNew Zealand and Television New Zealand will be maintained in public ownership.
My Government will not have a state asset sales programme, and Treasury has beeninstructed to cease all work on options for implementing such a programme.
It will be made clear to the boards of state-owned enterprises and other commercialorganisations that their job is not to prepare assets for sale but to enhance theirvalue and ability to contribute to economic and social growth and development asstate-owned entities.
My Government strongly backs public funding and public ownership of core social servicesand will not proceed with the previous government's proposals to commercialise roading.Legislation will be introduced to abolish the private insurance market for statutoryaccident compensation provision. Legislation will also provide for improvements toaccident compensation, including a greater emphasis on rehabilitation, and the reintroductionof entitlements to lump sum compensation.
In the health system, my Government wants to improve the health of New Zealanders,cut waiting times for elective surgery and put in place a coordinated mental healthstrategy.
Within the next three months, the government will finalise a timetable with the MentalHealth Commission for implementation of improved mental health services. Urgent workwill be undertaken to ensure that there are adequate housing and employment strategiesfor people with mental health disabilities.
My Government will increase funding for elective surgery. It is our aim to establishmaximum waiting times for treatment.
The Health Funding Authority will be abolished. Majority-elected boards will overseethe provision of the public health services. The emphasis will be changed to oneof cooperation, not competition, in the provision of health services. My Governmentwill place special emphasis on the health needs of women, older people, rural dwellersand Maoris.
My Government will restore income-related rents for state housing. Low-income statetenants will pay no more than 25 per cent of their income in rent. Social allocationof state housing based on need will be reintroduced and the state house buildingand acquisition programme will be expanded.
Special Housing Action Zones will be established in areas with particularly serioushousing needs where the land is predominantly in multiple ownership in order to increasethe supply and quality of housing.
My Government wishes to encourage home ownership. It will investigate ways of bridgingthe deposit gap so as to assist modest- income families into their first home. TheLow Deposit Rural Lending Scheme will be further developed. Self- build and sweatequity schemes will be supported.
My Government will urgently review aspects of the benefit system, such as abatementlevels, to ensure there are not disincentives for beneficiaries to re-enter the workforce.
My Government will institute an inquiry into the administration of Work and IncomeNew Zealand. In the meantime, a clear signal has been sent that there has to be anend to the culture of extravagance wherever it has developed in government agencies.
Individual needs for job-seekers will be identified through new programmes whichwill ensure quality case management. It is the intention to ensure that no youngperson leaves school to go on the dole. The work capacity assessment pilot will bedropped. A sickness benefit will be re-established as a non-work tested payment.
Burglary and youth crime will be targeted. My Government will provide legal recognitionfor victims' rights, including the right to be heard and to be informed. Court supportfor victims will be improved.
Early intervention programmes will help children to get off the path to crime. Everyschool will be required to enforce an adequate truancy policy.
Bail provisions will be reformed. Hard-core offenders charged with serious crimeswho have a record of breaching bail will have to show why they should get bail. MyGovernment will promote alternative sentences for offenders based on restorativejustice.
New Zealand's security in the world requires the most effective use of our diplomacyand limited capacity to support international peacemaking and peacekeeping. My Governmentsees New Zealand's role as being primarily to assist the United Nations in the latterendeavours.
A third Anzac frigate will not be purchased. The recent contract to acquire 28 F16swill be reviewed to determine whether it can be cancelled.
My Government is conscious that the ambitious programme it has announced will notbe easy to achieve. It is committed to maintaining tight fiscal discipline and hasbegun with itself.

Industries strike deal over climate change levy ENVIRONMENT COMPROMISE AGREED: [London edition]

Author: Brown, Kevin

Abstract: The 10 most energy-intensive industrial sectors yesterday accepted an 80 per cent discount on the government's proposed climate change levy, in return for cuts of 2.5m tonnes of carbon pollution over the next 10years. The deal, struck after months of negotiations with John Prescott's environment department, gives industry a smaller tax break than the 90 per cent or more sought by industry lobby groups. The chancellor also reduced the impact on business by cutting the levy by a third to 0.15p per kWh from 0.21p and exempting renewable energy and some environmentally-friendly combined heat and power systems.

Full text: The 10 most energy-intensive industrial sectors yesterday accepted an 80 per cent discount on the government's proposed climate change levy, in return for cuts of 2.5m tonnes of carbon pollution over the next 10years.
The deal, struck after months of negotiations with John Prescott's environment department, gives industry a smaller tax break than the 90 per cent or more sought by industry lobby groups.
However, it offers significantly greater savings than the 50 per cent discount offered when the tax was proposed last year as a key element of the government's international commitments on pollution reduction.
The chancellor also reduced the impact on business by cutting the levy by a third to 0.15p per kWh from 0.21p and exempting renewable energy and some environmentally-friendly combined heat and power systems.
Michael Meacher, the environment minister, said efficiency targets could be met through pollution trading when a workable scheme had been developed. He said the deal would make an important contribution to the UK's climate change programme.
However, industry and environmentalists said the deal was flawed. "It will not be easy, and substantial investment will be required to enable us to reach our target," said James Daglish, president of the paper federation.
Judith Hackitt, director of business and the environment at the Chemical Industries Association, said the deal would cut the impact on the sector to £10m a year from £75m, but the impact would vary considerably between companies.
Michael Roberts, head of industrial policy at the Confederation of British Industry, said several sectors would remain losers, which would damage their international competitiveness.
"No one is going to say that this is a complete victory, but it is better than it was," he said.
The deal is subject to agreement on technical details in the New Year. The government is also consulting on how to decide which energy efficiency investments should be eligible for capital allowances, and which CHP schemes should be exempt.
Friends of the Earth said the government's decision to negotiate the deal with the trade associations representing industry sectors rather than with individual companies would make it very difficult to police.
"We are concerned that the government may have gone for a soft option purely to get round the short-term problem of a lot of whinging from the industry lobbies," the environmental campaigning group said.
"The sectors are going to have to police this, and the history of voluntary agreements in this country is not encouraging."
The levy, which takes effect from April, will be paid by all businesses. But the biggest impact will be on manufacturers, in part because the £1bn it will raise will finance a cut in employers' national insurance contributions, which will mainly benefit the service sector.
The 10 industry sectors that have reached agreement with the government are: cement, glass, food and drink, non-ferrous metals, aluminium, paper, chemicals, foundries, steel and ceramics. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Full text: Britain's 10 biggest energy-using sectors yesterday agreed to cut carbon emissions by 2.5m tonnes a year by 2010 in return for an 80% discount in the climate change levy.
The agreement, due to be finalised next year, follows a commitment by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in his pre-budget statement last month to ease burden of the levy on heavy industry.
The levy, designed to help Britain meet its Kyoto target of reducing greenhouse gases by 20% by 2010, will raise pounds 1bn and be offset by a 0.3% cut in employers' national insurance contributions.
The 10 sectors - cement, food and drink, glass, non-ferrous metals, aluminium, paper, chemicals, foundries, steel and ceramics - account for more than half of energy used by manufacturing. The government hopes the levy will cut emissions by 4m tonnes overall.

Hell and high water The UN marked out the 1990s as a decade for natural disaster reduction. But this year has been one of the worst on record for environmental tragedies. And as the death toll rises after this week's floods in Venezuela, experts are predicting far worse to come. Tim Radford reports

Abstract: Here is how to become a disaster statistic. Move to a shanty town on an unstable hillside near a tropical coast. Crowd together as more and more people arrive. Wait for the world to get a little warmer. More evaporation means more rain, which means the slopes will get progressively more waterlogged. One day, the land will turn to mud, and the neighbourhood will begin to go downhill. Literally. `One, your house has been washed away; second, the land that you farmed has disappeared; and third, the mud and the debris have spread across other bits of land you might have been able to farm, so it's now useless.' He remembers some of the bedrock facts of survival after hurricane Mitch hit central America in 1998, dumped metres of water on the steep hillsides, and started landslides in which more than 10,000 perished. `We were talking about three metres of carcasses, debris, sand, just unuseable land. They are having to rebuild from scratch and the next time a disaster hits, they have so much less to work with. That's the real threat.' The catastrophe of Caracas came in the very last days of a decade marked out by the United Nations as an international decade for natural disaster reduction, IDNDR for short. The theory behind the decade was that as people were made aware of hazard, so they would prepare themselves to survive it. For a bitter cocktail of reasons, IDNDR didn't work out like that. During the 90s, the population of the world grew at the rate of 10,000 people an hour: 240,000 potential new victims every day, nearly 90 million a year, almost a billion in the decade. Most of the population growth was in the developing world, where people desperate for work moved to the cities, and then found homes on marginal soils, crowded into substandard buildings. Politically, too, life moved on. The idea that governments have an obligation to consider the welfare of all their citizens has been progressively weakened throughout the decade.

Full text: Here is how to become a disaster statistic. Move to a shanty town on an unstable hillside near a tropical coast. Crowd together as more and more people arrive. Wait for the world to get a little warmer. More evaporation means more rain, which means the slopes will get progressively more waterlogged. One day, the land will turn to mud, and the neighbourhood will begin to go downhill. Literally.
If the slope is steep enough, a landslide can accelerate to more than 200 miles an hour. Nothing can withstand it. What roads there may have been are gone. Clinics and health services will have been erased. Rescuers will not be able to get in, survivors will have trouble getting out. There will be no food, no clean water supply. The uncounted dead will remain in the shaking soil beneath your feet. Epidemics of cholera and fever will follow. The survivors will be so weakened as to be most likely counted among the dead the next time.
It has just happened in Venezuela, and it will happen again somewhere else very soon. Peter Walker, director of disaster policy for the international federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in Geneva, has seen it too often.
`One, your house has been washed away; second, the land that you farmed has disappeared; and third, the mud and the debris have spread across other bits of land you might have been able to farm, so it's now useless.'

The catastrophe of Caracas came in the very last days of a decade marked out by the United Nations as an international decade for natural disaster reduction, IDNDR for short. The theory behind the decade was that as people were made aware of hazard, so they would prepare themselves to survive it. For a bitter cocktail of reasons, IDNDR didn't work out like that. During the 90s, the population of the world grew at the rate of 10,000 people an hour: 240,000 potential new victims every day, nearly 90 million a year, almost a billion in the decade. Most of the population growth was in the developing world, where people desperate for work moved to the cities, and then found homes on marginal soils, crowded into substandard buildings. Politically, too, life moved on. The idea that governments have an obligation to consider the welfare of all their citizens has been progressively weakened throughout the decade.
On top of all that, add climate change and the spectre of global warming. Seven of the 10 warmest years have occurred in the 90s. The other three were all in the late 80s. A hotter ocean breeds fiercer cyclones and hurricanes. It surrenders greater quantities of water as evaporation, and more powerful winds dump this water against mountainsides with increasing fury. Last year the warmest on record was the worst year ever for climate-related disasters. According to Red Cross calculations, 57,513 people died and 335 million people lost their homes, or their livelihoods, or their crops, or their livestock, or their children, or their hopes. The economic bill not totted-up household losses, just the damage that could be estimated from satellite imagery was put at more than $50bn.
`Maybe it is the decade of heightening awareness to the fact that natural disasters actually kill far many more people than wars do. The figures for 1998 make appalling reading,'says Walker. This year, it will be worse. `We have appealed for more funding this year than any year in our history. Part of that is Kosovo rebuilding. But in terms of natural disasters, particularly those associated with rainfall and cyclones, it has been one of the worst on record.'
There are floods now in Vietnam and Yemen. There has been flooding in the Congo. People in Vanuatu were swept away by a tsunami last month. A catastrophic cyclone piled mountains of water onto the coasts of Orissa, India, in October. Three hurricanes in succession hit the eastern seaboard of the US. Disaster professionals have totted up more than 75 cases of major natural disaster floods, drought, windstorm, earthquake, avalanche, volcanic eruption and forest fire since the year began. Sometimes these hit the victims of another disaster the year before. Central America, for instance, has had some of the worst floods ever this year, as well as last.
`Everybody asked the question: are these floods as big as Hurricane Mitch?,' says Walker. `Answer: no. OK then, let's move on to the next major story. But the effect at household and village level is far larger than it would have been if you had not had hurricane Mitch. It's a double whammy.'
By the time it ends, 1999 will look like a year for apocalyptic fantasies; a kind of rehearsal for the predicted arrival of four horsemen, swiftly on the heels of the midnight moment of the closing millennium, cantering to bring calamity to a climax. If only. All the betting from the disaster professionals is that things will get worse and go on getting worse. A burgeoning population will go on competing for unevenly shared resources in a world in which sea levels will rise and land available for agriculture will dwindle. At the same time as millions are made miserable by torrential rain and coastal flooding, many arid zones will become drier. This is already evident: the Yellow River, once notorious for flooding the Chinese landscape, failed to reach the sea at all on 226 days in 1997 and a number of nations are already in armed conflict over water.
Around half the world now lives in cities, and more than 500m people live within range of a volcanic eruption. There are more than 500 active volcanoes, and around 50 of those are in eruption each year. An even greater number live at risk, in some degree, from earthquakes. These have taken more than 1.6m lives this century in 1976 one earthquake in China killed 242,000 people and the shaking earth claimed new victims this year in China, Turkey, Mexico and Greece. In each region, survivors will go on paying the price for years and the poorest are hurt the most. A calamitous quake in Kobe, Japan, in 1995, killed 5,466 and made 300,000 homeless in $100bn worth of damage: it was the costliest natural catastrophe the world had ever seen. Many people had no insurance: some of the victims are still in temporary housing five years on, others are still paying off mortgages for homes that suddenly ceased to exist in a few nightmare seconds. The survivors in tents along the Anatolian faultline will be in temporary shelter for years to come, at the mercy of increasingly inhospitable skies.
That is because a warming world means a stormier world, as people in low-lying countries such as Bangladesh discover repeatedly, and as Caracas discovered, cruelly, this week. `There are 40% more intense Atlantic hurricanes now than there were 30 years ago,' says Professor Bill McGuire of the Benfield Greig hazards research centre at University College, London. `That's one effect of warming the sea. You are going to get more windstorms. You are going to get unprecedented amounts of rain in very short times.'
McGuire is a vulcanologist. He has been warning for years that the world hasn't seen the worst nature can do, not by a long way. Forget about Mt St Helens in Washington State, or Pinatubo in the Philippines, he says, the worst eruption in human history was probably Mt Tambora in 1815, in Indonesia. It pumped so much dust into the stratosphere that it effectively cancelled the following summer in Europe and America, triggering famine and in part, at least, a worldwide cholera epidemic.
But geological evidence shows that 73,000 years ago there was a super-eruption that caused the kind of global winter you might expect only after allout thermonuclear war. `It reduced temperatures by maybe 6C in some places and plunged the whole planet into winter for at least a few years. It was devastating, there was no growing season. There are about two of these events every 100,000 years and the last one was 73,000 years ago.'
There are 30,000 earthquakes a year, most either relatively mild, or in uninhabited areas. Disaster experts estimate an average of one major disaster each year. Some of the nations at greatest risk the western United States, Japan, New Zealand have educated populations and carefully monitor building standards. But the lesson is that even prepared countries are not prepared enough, and a big earthquake in a rich nation could still trigger effects that would ripple round the world. Even if a disaster doesn't cost lives, it still costs money. With worldwide economic growth, more is always at stake. The insurance losses last year were more than the total for the entire 60s.
`The big one everyone is waiting for is Tokyo. It will come, and that will result in global economic chaos, and it will kill a hell of a lot of people as well,' says McGuire. `There are still a million wooden buildings in the Tokyo region. The gross domestic product of the area is greater than that of Britain, and if that is wiped out, the Japanese will have to bring all their monetary resources abroad, and that will devastate the global economy. There are lots of things worse than the Venezuela tragedy coming up.'

Abstract: The favourite scapegoat for strange meteorological goings on in the 1990s has been El Nino, a periodic warming of the southern and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, or its twin sister La Nina, a cooling current in the same area. Records show El Nino events have been getting stronger since the late 1970s, with the most severe events on record occurring in 1982- 83 and in 1997-98. The longest El Nino on record lasted from 1990 to mid-1995. There are reasons to think that global warming increases both the frequency and intensity of El Nino events, Kevin Trenberth, chief of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research at Boulder, Colo., recently told a scientific journal.

Full text: Note
Gordon Toole remembers the day it was so cold that spit froze before it hit the ground.
Toole was one of about 20 men working at a military airport at Snag, Yukon, when the temperature plunged to the deepest low ever recorded in North America.
"You can't breathe through your nostrils in air that temperature, it's almost as though they're blocked or frozen," he says from Snag, about 320 kilometres northwest of Yellowknife. "You have to breathe through your mouth but they're shallow breaths.
"You cannot take deep breaths because they just catch in your throat, you're gasping."
Toole recalls the crystal clarity of sounds. He could distinctly hear the barking of dogs in a village some five kilometres away. An airplane overhead was deafening.
The temperature was so low it couldn't be recorded on a mercury thermometer. Even in an alcohol thermometer, the liquid sank below the lowest temperature mark, settling into the bulb at the bottom.
They marked the point with a small file -- a pen wouldn't work -- and sent the thermometer to Toronto. Days later the reading was confirmed by experts: -62.2C.
The record set at Snag on Feb. 3, 1947, still stands. For Canadians who seemingly never get tired of talking about the weather, it's a classic tale, especially since there were no casualties and no real damage.
Recent years have seen many weather extremes that were not so benign.
Weather extremes
Few residents of Eastern Canada have forgotten the ice storm in 1998, when millions shivered in darkened houses or sought refuge in crowded public shelters.
Few residents of Manitoba have forgotten the flood of 1997, when the Red River turned into a vast sea, driving some 28,000 people from their homes and submerging whole towns.
The Saguenay Flood of 1996 caused massive damage, as did the Calgary hail storm of 1997. The current drought in the Prairies has helped to reduce Canada's breadbasket to a basket case as the year 2000 nears.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimates that insurance payments for extreme weather events across the country have been doubling every five to 10 years. Payouts last year reached $1.5 billion.
"The weather in Canada has been frightful," says Paul Kovaks, a spokesman for the bureau.
Munich Re of Munich, Germany, one of the world's biggest reinsurance companies, estimates global losses from weather-related natural disasters have increased to $90 billion annually from $7 billion to $8 billion annually in the 1980s.
Part of the rising toll results from population growth -- there's simply more property to be damaged, and more of it is built in risky areas like flood plains and coastlines.
Paradoxically, modern technology can also increase vulnerability to extreme weather since vital energy and communications systems across large areas are intertwined.
"The disaster is the event plus our vulnerability," says federal climatologist Roger Street. "Higher dependence on networked energy, higher dependence on telecommunications, makes us more vulnerable."
Climatologists would like to come up with an extreme-weather index so they could measure the apparent rise in instability. One of the problems is they can't agree on how to define an extreme weather event.
The great ice storm, for example, did not involve record-setting precipitation. It resulted from multiple factors, none of which would in itself be ranked as highly unusual; it was the combination that was unusual.
The favourite scapegoat for strange meteorological goings on in the 1990s has been El Nino, a periodic warming of the southern and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, or its twin sister La Nina, a cooling current in the same area.
El Nino effect
Climatologist David Phillips says in his recent book Blame it on the Weather that El Nino has become the scapegoat for everything from whale beachings in China to increased crime in Saskatoon.
But using the El Nino as a scapegoat merely pushes the mystery to a deeper level. Why has El Nino been causing so much more trouble than it used to?
Records show El Nino events have been getting stronger since the late 1970s, with the most severe events on record occurring in 1982- 83 and in 1997-98. The longest El Nino on record lasted from 1990 to mid-1995.
Is El Nino a messenger for something much bigger?
There are reasons to think that global warming increases both the frequency and intensity of El Nino events, Kevin Trenberth, chief of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research at Boulder, Colo., recently told a scientific journal.
"Because El Nino is involved with the movement of heat around, it is conceptually easy to see how increased heating from the buildup of greenhouse gases can interfere."
Some environmentalists are more forceful in their assessment.
"Warming is destabilizing the climate that has supported human civilization for thousands of years," says Europe-based Earthaction.
"The deep oceans are warming, fracturing Antarctic ice shelves and disrupting rainfall patterns. Glaciers are melting. Oceans are rising. Tropical diseases are spreading."
Climate warming
Few credible scientists dispute that the climate is warming: the finding has been confirmed by countless studies. There has been great debate about whether the trend is due to natural variability or human influence. Now that debate also seems to be settled.
"The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate," says the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, drawing on the expertise of hundreds of scientists around the world.
In the words of Environment Minister David Anderson in Parliament this year: "The best and most credible evidence we have before us suggests that climate change due to human activity is a reality."
Global warming is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases which are transparent to incoming solar rays but opaque to those rays when they bounce back from the surface of Earth at a different wave length.
Over the past century the average temperature of earth has risen by close to one degree Celsius. Now the big controversy concerns how fast future warming will occur and how it will affect different regions.
Much of the research is done with computer models simulating the atmosphere -- programs so complex that they push existing hardware to its limits. The models have many warts but they're getting better.
Canadians may welcome the prospect of milder winters, but what about the prospect of more frequent and severe droughts, floods and storms?
"It is extreme events that will be the biggest impact on Canadians from climate change," says Gordon McBean, assistant deputy to the federal environment minister.
Research suggests the warming is relatively subtle so far: Night- time temperatures are warmer than they used to be while day time maximum temperatures haven't changed much.
Another way of putting it: Canada is not getting hotter, it is getting less cold.
"If you go through the seasons, the winter is actually warming more than the summer is warming," says McBean. "Season by season, we're having bigger warming overall in the wintertime, so that makes you less cold."
The less-welcome news, perhaps, is that rising temperatures mean higher evaporation, which in turn will lead to higher precipitation. The models suggest this precipitation is likely to occur in less frequent but bigger rainfall or snowfall events.
"We have seen enough warming that the alarm bells should at least be sounding," says McBean.
"If there was an asteroid of large size coming toward the Earth and we thought there was a 30 per cent chance of it hitting the Earth, there would be very strong action by governments to try and do something, shoot it down or whatever."
At the 1997 Kyoto climate conference, Canada pledged to reduce its greenhouse emissions by six per cent from 1990 levels by 2008- 2012. But since then, emissions have continued to rise, and there is still no plan for reversing the trend.
Cutting emissions would require major changes in the way Canadians use energy, and would have an impact on virtually every industry. Disruptions in the near term might be high.
"The cost of action to reduce the risk is today, and the cost of inaction is in the future and hence there's a tendency for discounting the costs of inaction," says Henry Hengeveld, a senior adviser on climate change in the Environment Department.
The fossil fuel industry and the Alberta government have denounced the Kyoto commitment as unrealistic, and skeptics continue to find platforms for their views.
Hengeveld, for one, is not discouraged. He expects that the weather itself will settle the quarrel.

Turnaround Decade began with a bang, ended with a whimper: [Final Edition]

Abstract: At the beginning of the decade significant progress was made in B.C. on a number of fronts that the environmental community should take pride in: land-use planning began, a sustainability Act was drafted; a Forest Practices Code was legislated; timber supply reviews were initiated; and many new parks were created. On the pollution front, pulp mills began to clean up their act, air quality improved and accumulations of toxic chemicals in wildlife were reduced. Meanwhile, the turnaround continues within the environmental community. Thanks to substantial funding from Canadian and U.S. foundations and from individual donors, hundreds of activists are now working on projects. These activists work hand-in-hand with thousands of volunteers to better the environment and society. One organization alone, the Sierra Legal Defence Fund, has grown from a staff of four to 43 lawyers and support staff, including 10 in its Toronto office. The B.C. environmental community has become a force to reckon with as alliances are made with other sectors and the international marketplace pays increasingly higher attention to our concerns.

Full text: The 1990s began with high optimism and energy to turn around the destructive impacts of pollution and resource extraction. During what the Worldwatch Institute labelled the Turnaround Decade , activists across the world busted their butts to create change.
At the beginning of the decade significant progress was made in B.C. on a number of fronts that the environmental community should take pride in: land-use planning began, a sustainability Act was drafted; a Forest Practices Code was legislated; timber supply reviews were initiated; and many new parks were created. On the pollution front, pulp mills began to clean up their act, air quality improved and accumulations of toxic chemicals in wildlife were reduced.
For more than half of this decade, B.C. shimmered in glory as the environment took prominence in government decision-making.
But with the change in leadership, came a change in direction. Instead of sustainability and ecosystem protection, economic forces redirected decision-making to focus on labour and industrial interests. Mega-projects, government bailouts, cuts to the Environment Ministry budget, jobs and timber, and a business lens to oversee legislation became the order of the day.
Long approved land-use plans remain unimplemented as the government dithers over the wording of higher level objectives. Admittedly, parks continued to be created, but overall, a coat of brown paint quickly covered up the green tint.
Meanwhile, the turnaround continues within the environmental community. Thanks to substantial funding from Canadian and U.S. foundations and from individual donors, hundreds of activists are now working on projects. These activists work hand-in-hand with thousands of volunteers to better the environment and society. One organization alone, the Sierra Legal Defence Fund, has grown from a staff of four to 43 lawyers and support staff, including 10 in its Toronto office. The B.C. environmental community has become a force to reckon with as alliances are made with other sectors and the international marketplace pays increasingly higher attention to our concerns.
But these accomplishments pale beside the global impacts of environmental destruction. The impacts of climate change have moved from theory to reality as insurance claims skyrocket from storms, fires and floods. Media reports of Arctic ice sheets breaking up, tropical forests burning, sea life dying and massive wind storms spread gloom and doom throughout the world. And now, instead of trying to turn things around, we are trying to prevent further globalization from lowering environmental standards and further widening the gap between the rich and the poor.
The breakdown of the WTO talks in Seattle, although seemingly a victory, is but a stopgap measure as powerful transnational corporations continue to profit at the expense of the health of the planet and its people. The irony is that with each new disaster, the GDP goes up instead of down, as more forests are felled and more people are employed to rebuild communities.
If all our hard work failed to turn things around in the last decade of the second millennium, then what should we call the first decade of the new millennium? As the planet continues to heat up and the oceans rise, perhaps the new decade should be called The Wet One. Or, if the alliance of people and groups to fight further globalization continues to build, we could call it the People Power decade. We can only hope that all people of the industrialized countries simplify their lifestyles to lessen over-consumption so as to finally help turn things around.

FORD'S SENSE COMPANY TAKES LEAD WITH SMART STEPS TO CLEAR AIR

Abstract: The automaker, to its credit, has just quit the Global Climate Coalition, a group of businesses whose stance on the rise in greenhouse gases can be roughly summarized as, "What, me worry?" The GCC is much more fearful of environmental regulators than of global heat-up, and it has spent a lot of money trying to persuade people that global warming is a figment of someone's fevered imagination.

Full text:   Ford Motor Co. has become the latest in a line of corporate converts on the
subject of global warming. The automaker, to its credit, has just quit the
Global Climate Coalition, a group of businesses whose stance on the rise in
greenhouse gases can be roughly summarized as, "What, me worry?"
The GCC is much more fearful of environmental regulators than of global
heat-up, and it has spent a lot of money trying to persuade people that global
warming is a figment of someone's fevered imagination. It's true the issue is
full of unknowns. There's no doubt about the buildup of greenhouse gases. What
happens as a result of that buildup, though, is not easily predictable.
Still, many businesses have decided to factor the rise in the global
thermometer into their plans. Insurance companies are a good example. When
they started thinking about their liability, if melting polar ice or
mega-hurricanes send the Atlantic Ocean washing over Miami or Manhattan, they
became intensely interested in the consequences of global warming.
The prudent policy is to begin with actions that are beneficial whether or not
the worst fears about climate change come true. It looks as if that's what
Ford is doing. Its low-emission trucks and high-mileage hybrids will emit
fewer greenhouse gases. But if global warming fizzles, the new vehicles will
still provide cleaner air and lower fuel costs.
And Ford will be one jump ahead of the regulators all the way. That doesn't
sound like bunny-hugging foolishness. It sounds like good business and
responsible behavior that more firms should follow.

Abstract: OTTAWA - The Liberal caucus of MPs has voted to give priority to discussions about tax cuts rather than the prime minister's children's agenda. The caucus agreed to 10 resolutions that will be considered by delegates at the Liberal's biennial convention in March. In addition to support for an improved infrastructure program that will encourage greater spending on road improvement schemes, the MPs signalled their intent to push for broad tax cuts for both businesses and individual Canadians. Paul DeVillers, Liberal caucus chair, said he was a "little bit" surprised that a national highway program emerged as the priority for caucus discussions, followed by the call for tax reductions. Although the roads issue has been raised several times in recent years, it has not received the provincial support necessary to get the roads paved.

OTTAWA - The Liberal caucus of MPs has voted to give priority to discussions about tax cuts rather than the prime minister's children's agenda.
The caucus agreed to 10 resolutions that will be considered by delegates at the Liberal's biennial convention in March. In addition to support for an improved infrastructure program that will encourage greater spending on road improvement schemes, the MPs signalled their intent to push for broad tax cuts for both businesses and individual Canadians.
In an agreed resolution, the caucus notes, "Canadian taxpayers have strongly endorsed the concept of tax reduction" and "the general public understands the need for debt reduction in order to reduce the interest and debt-repayment burden facing future generations of taxpayers."
The resolution says the Liberal caucus strongly endorses "the concept of substantial and sustainable reductions to personal and business tax rates as well as a long-term debt reduction plan with achievable and measurable targets to be established."
The resolution also recognizes the need for the reduction of Canada's $577-billion debt. Recently, business leaders, among them John Roth, chief executive of Nortel Networks Corp., have urged the federal government to offer tax breaks to help emerging high-tech firms attract and keep talented employees.
In one of eight auxiliary resolutions that Liberal MPs also want debated next March is a proposal to raise the annual tax break for small business to $400,000 from $200,000, "thereby fostering job growth, reinvestment and research and development amongst Canada's small business sector."
Paul DeVillers, Liberal caucus chair, said he was a "little bit" surprised that a national highway program emerged as the priority for caucus discussions, followed by the call for tax reductions. Although the roads issue has been raised several times in recent years, it has not received the provincial support necessary to get the roads paved.
Mr. DeVillers said the emphasis on infrastructure funding and tax cuts should not be interpreted as a sign that Liberal MPs do not care about new spending on such items as the children's agenda. Nor, he said, are they straying from Jean Chretien's formula of devoting half of budget surpluses to new social and economic programs and the other half to debt and tax relief.
Mr. DeVillers said most MPs expect the children's agenda -- a $9- billion, five-year set of programs and spending, including increasing the annual child-tax benefit and extending maternity and parental benefits from the current maximum of six months to one full year -- to be the focus of February's budget, a month before the party convention, leaving little need for subsequent discussion.
"I think that's why it's conspicuous by its absence, because it's a given in the next budget," he said.
The leading auxiliary resolution calls for amendments to the Employment Insurance Act that would promote job creation and also make it easier to access EI.
And in an apparent attempt to address two growing financial crises on very different fronts, the caucus has put forth resolutions to aid farmers and the Canadian Armed Forces.
The MPs are urging Agricultural Supply Management Programs be kept in place "to ensure the protection and stability of our most strategic resources [namely agricultural production]." And they are calling for an increase in defence spending to address the greater role Canada plays on the international stage in NATO and United Nations peacekeeping missions.
The caucus also voted in favour of resolutions calling for discussions with the provinces on the implementation of pharmacare, a national strategy for freshwater resources, job creation and climate change.

Roads, tax cuts Grit priorities; Liberal MPs attempt to put a more right-leaning face on policy to be considered at party's convention: [Final Edition]

Abstract: In a move that seems to ignore calls for a children's agenda, Liberal MPs say their No. 2 priority is a resolution that calls for a tax break for "business" as well as individual Canadians. The resolution also recognizes the need for the reduction of Canada's $577-billion debt mountain. DeVillers said the emphasis on tax cuts should not be interpreted as a sign that Liberal MPs don't care about new spending on such items as the government's vaunted children's agenda. Nor, he says, are they straying from Jean Chretien's formula of devoting half of budget surpluses to new social and economic programs and the other half to debt and tax relief. Eight "auxiliary" resolutions were adopted and they will be debated in workshops during the party's convention. The top auxiliary resolution calls for amendments to the Employment Insurance Act that would promote job creation and make access to EI easier.

The Liberal caucus, in a move that appears to try to put a more right-leaning stamp on government policy, voted Nov. 24 on 10 resolutions to be considered by delegates at the Liberal's biennial convention.
No. 1 on the list is a resolution urging the Liberal government to "call upon the Federal, Provincial and Municipal governments to work together toward the creation of another infrastructure program, paying specific attention to a National Highway Component."

Abstract: More than four million Canadians were affected directly by the 1996 Saguenay flood, the 1997 Red River flood and last year's ice storm. Last year alone, Canadians spent $3-billion recovering from weather extremes. This suffering could have been reduced if we had invested in projects to make Canadians less vulnerable and more resilient to extreme events.

This editorial was written about a very different conference on Building Resilient Communities than the one I attended. Some speakers discussed aspects of climate change during the conference, but mostly we heard from leading scientists and experts about lessons that we should learn from past disasters. The overall message was: We have the knowledge to reduce the human suffering and the financial losses due to extreme events, what we need now is the leadership and drive to act.
More than four million Canadians were affected directly by the 1996 Saguenay flood, the 1997 Red River flood and last year's ice storm. Last year alone, Canadians spent $3-billion recovering from weather extremes. This suffering could have been reduced if we had invested in projects to make Canadians less vulnerable and more resilient to extreme events.
Canadian insurers propose the establishment of a fund to invest in projects to protect Canadians. Small investments today could save taxpayers a great deal of money and personal hardship in the future. For example, $63-million was spent in the 1960s to build a floodway in Winnipeg and, since then, governments have saved several hundreds of millions of dollars in disaster relief payments. We have the knowledge to make our communities more resilient to extreme events. Those who would like to help are invited to contact the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

Home truths: You're invited to join a house warming party Homeowners can save money - and the planet - by spending a few pounds on their properties.

Abstract: This winter, householders will squeeze money through gaps in the floorboards, throw it out of the window and through the roof. They will waste thousands of pounds on sky-high fuel bills through a lack of basic insulation in their homes, say energy campaigners. The arguments for putting more effort into saving energy are hard to ignore. Carbon dioxide emissions could be cut by 11.5% in the UK if everyone introduced energy-efficient measures in the home, says the Energy Saving Trust, an advisory body supported by the government. Not only is the planet suffering but homeowners are shelling out unnecessarily, it says. The average house can save pounds 200 a year through energy-efficient measures that may cost little or nothing to put into place. Last month the government published plans to make home buying and selling in England and Wales faster and easier. Among the proposals are measures to provide homebuyers with detailed information about the quantity of heat, light and other forms of energy used by the property they want to buy as part of a report on its condition.

Full text: This winter, householders will squeeze money through gaps in the floorboards, throw it out of the window and through the roof. They will waste thousands of pounds on sky-high fuel bills through a lack of basic insulation in their homes, say energy campaigners.
Now environmental charities are calling on the government to cut the price of DIY home insulation products to galvanise consumers into action.
The arguments for putting more effort into saving energy are hard to ignore. Carbon dioxide emissions could be cut by 11.5% in the UK if everyone introduced energy-efficient measures in the home, says the Energy Saving Trust, an advisory body supported by the government.
Not only is the planet suffering but homeowners are shelling out unnecessarily, it says. The average house can save pounds 200 a year through energy-efficient measures that may cost little or nothing to put into place. Last month the government published plans to make home buying and selling in England and Wales faster and easier. Among the proposals are measures to provide homebuyers with detailed information about the quantity of heat, light and other forms of energy used by the property they want to buy as part of a report on its condition.
Friends of the Earth has lobbied the government for two years to introduce the measures, which are supported by the Council of Mortgage Lenders. The charity expects properties to be given an energy efficiency rating along with advice on improvements. The extra information is expected to cost no more than pounds 10, says FoE.
The government is committed to tackling climate change and global warming by cutting carbon dioxide emissions by a fifth by the year 2010. Critics say ministers are in danger of falling short of that target unless they do more to encourage householders to play a part.
Environmental campaigners want ministers to end the anomaly between the amount of VAT charged on energy consumption or fuel - 5% - and the amount charged on energy saving materials - 17.5%. The government has made some concessions but these have been confined to a limited reduction in VAT rates on materials purchased under particular government grant schemes, says Martyn Williams, senior parliamentary officer at FoE.
The government says its hands are tied by the EU law that prevents it lowering VAT. Mr Williams has written to chancellor Gordon Brown arguing that this position is no longer sustainable. In September, the French government cut VAT rates on energy-saving materials from 22% to 5.5% and Italy is following suit.
Mr Williams welcomes the inclusion of an energy audit in the homebuyer's survey, but points out that the proposals are unlikely to be implemented for another couple of years. In the meantime, cutting the costs of energy-saving materials would give householders an added incentive to take the matter seriously, he says.
Some lenders are doing their bit to encourage homeowners to lag their boilers, insulate their lofts and fill their cavity walls. Homebuyers who undertake a Homefile survey offered through the Woolwich receive a energy efficiency rating on the property as well as more traditional elements such as a home condition report.
Norwich and Peterborough has gone further in offering financial carrots to encourage green thinking. Last year the society launched a green mortgage, designed to `encourage homebuyers and developers to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions". In practice this means measuring a property's energy efficiency using a procedure which rates it between 1 and 100 - the higher the rating, the more efficient the home.
New homes have an average rating of 70 and second-hand properties a dismal 35. The government is asking developers to build homes with a rating of 80 or more.
For those living in older homes or who want to remortgage, the N&P's green mortgage offers a 1.25% dis count off the standard variable rate for two years, with the proviso that they take out the society's buildings and contents insurance during the discounted rate period; a free energy survey and pounds 500 cashback towards home improvements recommended by the energy survey. Those buying new- build homes through the N&P with an energy rating of 80 or more can obtain a 2% discount off the standard variable rate for two years.
Savers with the Ecology Building Society can apply for an Earthsaver Remortgage which promotes energy efficient home improvements. The society's valuation comes with a free energy survey that includes the current energy rating and the maximum score achievable if improvements are made. For the society to lend, the borrower must undertake to achieve 80% of the maximum energy rating score.
Householders not in the market for a new mortgage or survey can have their home surveyed by an energy rating assessor. The Federation of Authorised Energy Rating Organisations can provide the name of local ex perts. Alternatively, the Energy Saving Trust offers a free DIY home energy check via the Energy Efficiency Hotline on 0345-277- 200. After answering some questions, applicants will receive a personalised report on the most cost efficient ways to save energy in their home.
Climate change and global warming are not far-off catastrophes: experts predict their effects will be felt within the next few years. Friends of the Earth says homeowners who make small improvements to their homes now will have a positive impact on the future.

Where $609 Billion in Federal Spending Will Go: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: After an odyssey that began with President Clinton delivering his fiscal 2000 budget plan to Congress on Feb. 1, Congress finished its work for the year late last week, completing action on a $385 billion spending package that finances seven Cabinet departments and the District of Columbia government (which got $435.8 million). In all, the 13 spending bills covering all defense and domestic spending other than entitlements total $609 billion. This figure, however, doesn't account for the 0.38 percent across-the-board cut agreed to by Congress and Clinton to help offset new spending. A tumultuous year in which American farmers were parched by drought, soaked by floods and buffeted by low commodity prices led to an 11 percent increase in the Department of Agriculture's budget to $68 billion, up from $61 billion for fiscal 1999.

Full text: After an odyssey that began with President Clinton delivering his fiscal 2000 budget plan to Congress on Feb. 1, Congress finished its work for the year late last week, completing action on a $385 billion spending package that finances seven Cabinet departments and the District of Columbia government (which got $435.8 million).
Eight other appropriations bills were passed earlier.
In all, the 13 spending bills covering all defense and domestic spending other than entitlements total $609 billion. This figure, however, doesn't account for the 0.38 percent across-the-board cut agreed to by Congress and Clinton to help offset new spending.
Outlays are the amount of money the government proposes to spend in the fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. The agencies generally discuss their funding in terms of budget authority, the amount of money the law allows the government to commit to spend in either the current or future fiscal years. Highlights of how each agency would be affected:
AGRICULTURE
A tumultuous year in which American farmers were parched by drought, soaked by floods and buffeted by low commodity prices led to an 11 percent increase in the Department of Agriculture's budget to $68 billion, up from $61 billion for fiscal 1999.
The budget includes a farm bailout package worth $8.7 billion, up from the $6 billion emergency package passed last year.
Clinton accepted the $8.7 billion figure in order to get aid to farmers as quickly as possible but criticized it as poorly targeted, with payments possibly going to farmers who had not planted crops.
Clinton and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman also complained that the back-to-back bailouts were a direct result of the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act, passed by Republicans intent on phasing out federal subsidies for farmers. Glickman has promised to offer legislation next year to revamp the Freedom to Farm law.
The largest chunk of the agriculture budget, $35 billion, is devoted to food and nutrition programs, including food stamps, school lunches and the Women, Infants and Children program.
The second-biggest piece, $17.6 billion, is intended to aid farmers through operational loans, crop insurance and price supports.
--Ben White
COMMERCE
The Commerce Department came away with $8.7 billion, $3.5 billion more than its fiscal 1999 funding. The reason for the huge jump: the 2000 census. Despite the overall gain, the department's budget is still $370 million below the White House's request.
About $4.48 billion of the department's outlays is emergency funding for the census. Lawmakers gave the White House almost all the funding it wanted for the census, falling just $11 million short.
The National Weather Service got $604 million, a $43 million increase. But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the weather service, took a major hit: It was funded at $2.35 billion, $176 million above the previous year's level but $164 million below Clinton's request.
Also taking a big hit was the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Advanced Technology Program, which has helped companies develop infant technologies since fiscal 1990. It got $142 million, $61 million less than in the previous year, but the program has roughly that amount of carry-over money from past budgets.
--John Burgess
DEFENSE
The defense appropriations bill delivered $267.8 billion in outlays for the Pentagon, $4.5 billion more than Clinton had requested. To meet spending caps, Congress built a number of bookkeeping maneuvers into the legislation, such as counting some military pay costs as emergency spending and stretching out funding on some programs.
The $73.9 billion appropriated for personnel costs includes a 4.8 percent across-the-board pay increase for service members--the biggest raise given to the armed forces in 18 years--plus a number of targeted raises for individuals with selected skills or experience that make them especially valuable or hard to retain.
Perhaps the most controversial procurement item in the current budget is the $1 billion for the Air Force's F-22 Raptor, the newest stealth fighter.
--Roberto Suro
EDUCATION
At the Education Department, which has prospered during the Clinton years, the budget rose to $35.6 billion, up $2.1 billion or 6.3 percent. Most of the increase will be used for the department's traditional mission of helping disadvantaged students.
The largest single increase, $700 million, is devoted to special education services that school districts must provide under federal law to learning-disabled children. An additional $254 million is intended for after-school programs in inner-city and rural areas. An extra $210 million is to be spent on the Title 1 remedial program for disadvantaged students, which remains the agency's biggest discretionary program. A Clinton initiative to hire more teachers to reduce class sizes in the earliest grades received a $100 million funding increase.
The maximum benefit under the Pell Grant program for low-income college students is up $175, to $3,300.
--Kenneth J. Cooper
ENERGY
Not counting the 0.38 percent across-the-board spending cut, the Department of Energy ended up with $17.432 billion in budget authority--up from $17.308 billion the previous year.
The biggest increase was for DOE's cleanup of environmental hot spots such as Hanford, the former nuclear weapons manufacturing site in Washington state. DOE received a $93 million increase for that type of environmental management. Other increases were $46 million for defense programs, such as DOE's atomic weapons stockpile stewardship, and $55 million for work on energy efficiency and renewable energy.
DOE programs on environmental safety and health as well as nonproliferation and national security sustained small cuts.
--Martha M. Hamilton
EPA
The Environmental Protection Agency, a major target of GOP budget- cutting after the Republicans took over Congress in 1995, held its own. The $7.59 billion total for the agency was the same as in the previous year, and funds for environmental programs and management grew by $50 million--less than what Clinton had requested.
Congress generally avoided "riders" restricting EPA's environmental enforcement, although the final budget exempts scrap metal dealers from liability for cleanup costs at "Superfund" toxic- waste sites.
However, Congress cut the president's request for the Climate Change Technology Initiative by more than $111 million, bringing its 2000 funding to $115 million, the same as in 1999. State-level revolving funds for safe drinking water amounted to $820 million, $20 million above the president's request, while the revolving funds for clean water were boosted $500 million above the request, to $1.35 billion.
--Dan Morgan
HHS
Congress provided $4.65 billion for the Health and Human Services Department this year, up from $4.3 billion last year.
As part of an ongoing effort to double biomedical research over the next five years, the bill boosts the National Institutes of Health's budget by 15 percent, to $17.9 billion, $2 billion above the president's request. However, the legislation delays $3 billion of that spending to avoid dipping into the Social Security surplus. NIH does not expect the delay to affect research activities, unlike the original plan to postpone $7.5 billion in spending.
The measure includes $1.6 billion for Ryan White AIDS programs-- $184 million more than last year's level--and $3 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a $264 million boost.
--Juliet Eilperin
HUD
Republicans had threatened severe cuts in the Department of Housing and Urban Development budget but, in the end, they agreed to modest increases in most major HUD programs. All told, the department got $26.3 billion, up $2.2 billion from the year before--but $1.7 billion below what Clinton had requested.
The most striking compromise brought 60,000 new rental vouchers for low-income families, after the Clinton administration had requested 100,000 and Republicans had countered with zero.
The budget also includes more money for public housing renovation projects, homelessness initiatives and anti-discrimination programs. And it will fund a bipartisan plan to help protect hundreds of thousands of subsidized-housing residents from the conversion of their subsidized apartments to market-rate housing.
--Michael Grunwald
INTERIOR
Interior Department officials say they are pleased with their fiscal 2000 appropriation of about $8.35 billion, a 5.5 percent increase over fiscal 1999. "We've always been one of the best-loved departments, but we haven't always been one of the best funded," said John M. Berry, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget. "We're glad to see Congress start to turn that around a little bit."
Interior got almost $330 million in budget authority for the administration's "Land Legacy" program for land conservation and acquisition, a little more than half the administration's original request. The Bureau of Indian Affairs received a 7.2 percent increase in funding, including $95 million to improve the agency's management of tribal members' trust assets.
Interior also got $2.86 billion for the land management operations of the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service--just $25 million shy of the administration's original request.
--Tom Kenworthy
JUSTICE
The Justice Department's budget for fiscal 2000 is $21.2 billion, slightly more than the $20.8 billion in fiscal 1999 and reflecting a leveling off after years of growth, officials said.
While there was a modest increase to account for inflation and the federal pay raise, there was a significant decrease of about $850 million in funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services program (COPS), which is aimed at putting more police officers on the streets. The Bureau of Prisons got the biggest chunk of the budget, with $3.1 billion for salary and expenses and $557 million for new prison construction.
While the Justice Department did not receive the $20 million it wanted for a massive lawsuit against the tobacco industry, the agency is permitted to reprogram funds within its budget to carry the lawsuit forward. Justice did get $10 million for a new "community prosecution" program led by Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.
And the budget includes money for the Immigration and Naturalization Service to hire 1,000 border patrol officers.
The department's civil rights division, which handles hate crimes, got a funding boost of more than $10 million, to $82.2 million.
--David A. Vise
LABOR
In the end, the budget for fiscal 2000 turned out to be a pleasant surprise for the Labor Department. After months of seeing the House trim one program after another, budget negotiators restored almost all of the cuts during the final days of negotiations.
The department ended up with about $11.22 billion in budget authority--a 3 percent increase over the fiscal 1999 level, or half of the increase the White House had requested. The final amount was 11 percent higher than the spending authority approved by the House.
In the final budget negotiations, spending authority was restored for a wide variety of departmental programs, from worker protection and employment training to occupational safety and health, although almost all of the funding was below the president's original budget request. The final spending bill restored $143 million that had been cut in the bill vetoed on Oct. 27 by Clinton.
--Frank Swoboda
STATE
Congress appropriated $22.3 billion for international affairs, $200 million more than the amount the president had requested but less than the $23.4 billion spending level reached during fiscal 1999.
The fiscal 1999 amount had swelled from an initial appropriation of $19.7 billion after supplemental bills were passed for humanitarian aid for Kosovo, anti-narcotics operations and heightened embassy security after the bombings in Tanzania and Kenya. The fiscal 2000 budget continues to stress embassy security, with $314 million for building new and secure embassies and $254 million for increased operational security spending, such as hiring more guards and diplomatic security agents. It also doubles support for international peacekeeping operations, to $500 million.
In the final international affairs appropriations, Congress put in $1.8 billion to fund the Wye accords--which provide additional aid to Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. An extra $25 million was inserted for Egypt. Separately, Congress finally authorized $926 million--appropriated over three years--to cover U.S. arrears owed to the United Nations. The administration, however, got only $123 million of the $370 million it sought to ease the burden borne by poor, heavily indebted developing countries. The Peace Corps failed to get the money needed to expand, but got enough to maintain its current level of volunteers.
--Steven Mufson
TRANSPORTATION
Congress approved a total of $50.17 billion in mandatory and discretionary spending for transportation in fiscal 2000, a $2.9 billion increase over the previous year.
The bill includes $27.7 billion for highway spending, a $2.2 billion increase, and $5.79 billion for mass transit, a $407 million increase. The measure also provides $1.95 billion for airport improvements, a $350 million increase, and full funding of $571 million for Amtrak, the financially troubled railroad.
--Eric Pianin
TREASURY
The Treasury Department spending bill generally kept its programs at about the same funding levels as the previous year. The bill met Clinton's request for the Internal Revenue Service, providing $8.2 billion, which will allow the agency to continue its modernization and reorganization initiatives.
The Customs Service received $1.94 billion, including $4 million to target international child pornography trafficking and child exploitation via the Internet.
Overall, the bill contains $12.3 billion for Treasury, up from $12 billion in fiscal 1999.
The bill also doubles the presidential salary to $400,000, effective in January 2001, and allows a pay raise for members of Congress, who will receive a $4,600 cost-of-living increase in January 2000, increasing their salaries to $141,300.
--Stephen Barr
VETERANS AFFAIRS
The Department of Veterans Affairs received about $19 billion for veterans' medical care in fiscal 2000, a $1.7 billion increase and far more than Congress has ever provided for VA health care in a single year. The VA said the extra money will help improve the quality of its medical care and cut down on waiting times for health services.
There is also more than $23 billion for entitlement programs. To expedite claims processing, Congress provided an extra $51 million over last year's level, which the VA said would allow the department to move 440 additional employees into claims work.

Abstract: Businesses in Britain's wealthiest regions fail to recognise that climate change could destroy their livelihoods, environmental experts have warned. In a report examining the effect of climate change on Britain over the next 50 years, specialists argue that global warming could bring storm surges and rising sea levels to the south-east. It says the service sector, which employs 1.5m people in the region, could be hard hit as coastal flooding and dry, hot summers transform transport, health and work.

Full text: Businesses in Britain's wealthiest regions fail to recognise that climate change could destroy their livelihoods, environmental experts have warned.
In a report examining the effect of climate change on Britain over the next 50 years, specialists argue that global warming could bring storm surges and rising sea levels to the south-east.
It says the service sector, which employs 1.5m people in the region, could be hard hit as coastal flooding and dry, hot summers transform transport, health and work.
Experts warn that water-intensive users such as paper, pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturers could become uncompetitive if above-average tempera-tures dried up the water supply and the quality of groundwater was damaged.
The insurance sector may face spiralling claims for coastal flooding, subsidence and wind, and millions of pounds would have to be spent on flood defences.
Meanwhile, droughts could reduce rivers to shallow streams and an increase in pests and livestock disease would affect already hard- pressed farmers.
Merylyn McKenzie-Hedger, programme co-ordinator of the UK Climate Impacts Programme, which commissioned the study, said: "The south-east is under pressure from many quarters and climate change is going to make things worse. A new planning agenda is required - doing nothing is not an option."
However, the report, produced by consultants W S Atkins, the Meteorological Office and the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service, suggests that hot dry summers could provide a fillip to the tourist industry as visitor numbers grow.

Abstract: GORDON Brown's planned pounds 1 billion tax on big energy users is "seriously flawed" and will hit West Midlands firms with the most part-time workers, top business advisers claim. The Chancellor gave ground by moderating plans for the so-called climate change levy in his pre-Budget speech earlier this month, but did not silence his critics who claim it will particularly hit industry in the region.

Full text: GORDON Brown's planned pounds 1 billion tax on big energy users is "seriously flawed" and will hit West Midlands firms with the most part-time workers, top business advisers claim.
The Chancellor gave ground by moderating plans for the so-called climate change levy in his pre-Budget speech earlier this month, but did not silence his critics who claim it will particularly hit industry in the region.
Carole Rankin, Birmingham-based partner with Deloitte & Touche, said: "The levy will significantly increase the energy bills of many companies thereby potentially putting many of those companies out of business or driving them overseas.
"It will also involve considerable extra compliance costs for energy providers."
Her comments were backed by economic adviser Prof Roger Bootle who said that the proposed offsetting of the energy tax through a national insurance rebate was badly flawed.
He said: "It cannot yet be known whether the amount to be raised from the levy and the amount to be handed back will be equal."
He pointed out that the redistribution of cash would not only depend on how much energy companies used but also the structure of their wage bill.
With an pounds 83 limit below which no national insurance is paid, those firms with a host of part-time workers earning less than the threshold would get less back.
"Employers of part-time workers, or those businesses which offer employment commanding relatively low wages - jobs which the Government is supposedly trying to encourage - will enjoy the lowest rebates and, even if they are only average users of energy,may be hit most severely," said Prof Bootle.

Abstract: The climate change levy will add greatly to the costs of many industries, accountants Deloitte & Touche have warned. Although, in theory at least, it will be offset by a reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions, the levy is estimated to raise approximately pounds 1 billion a year. Ms Carole Rankin, a partner with Deloitte & Touche in Birmingham, said: "CCl will significantly increase the energy bills of many companies, thereby potentially putting many of them out of business or driving them overseas.

Full text: The climate change levy will add greatly to the costs of many industries, accountants Deloitte & Touche have warned.
Although, in theory at least, it will be offset by a reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions, the levy is estimated to raise approximately pounds 1 billion a year.
Ms Carole Rankin, a partner with Deloitte & Touche in Birmingham, said: "CCl will significantly increase the energy bills of many companies, thereby potentially putting many of them out of business or driving them overseas.
"It will also involve considerable extra compliance costs for energy providers."
A CCl discount of up to 80 per cent will be applicable to limited categories of energy-intensive business but only if certain energy measures are introduced.
Prof Roger Bootle, economic adviser at Deloitte & Touche, said: "Given that the aim of the tax is to discourage the use of energy, it is to be expected that high energy users would be badly hit. But the design of the tax and the supposedly offsettingreduction in national insurance is seriously flawed.
"It cannot yet be known whether the amount to be raised from CCL and the amount to be handed back will be equal."
But, says the firm, even if the rates for CCl and rebates are accurately set so as to make them exactly offsetting, there will be a redistribution between firms that is largely arbitrary, depending, not only upon the amount and type of their energyconsumption, but also upon the structure of their wage bill.
The rebate comes in proportion to their NI bill, yet their NI bill is not in proportion to their wage bill because there is an pounds 83 threshold below which no National Insurance is paid.

Full text: A WEST Midlands energy management company has powered to more than pounds 10 million of potential orders in two days - helped by Gordon Brown.
Halesowen-based Energy Services found its order books swelling this week as it exhibited at the NEMEX '99 show at the National Exhibition Centre.
The independent company, which has the backing of Midlands Electricty, helps businesses manage their energy and environmental needs with an eye on government legislation.
Its dramatic orders flow followed last week's confirmation by the Chancellor that he was to press on with the proposed energy tax which will hit heavy industrial consumers of power the hardest.
Although he modified the planned climate change levy, it was not enough to reassure many sectors of industry.
It has caused a storm with West Midlands business leaders, many of whom believe the rebate through the national insurance roll would benefit only labour-intensive service industries which were relatively light on energy consumption.
Under the tax, which will come into force in April 2001, rebates for intensive users will be boosted to up to 80 per cent and allow exemptions for combined heat and power systems.
But Mr Brown ruled out taking steps to weight the tax against carbon use, leaving a large number of companies and organisations excluded from any potential rebates.
Energy Services spokesman Stuart Jackson said: "With the millennium bug preparations largely out of the way, businesses are waking up to the implications of the climate change levy and the challenge to remain competitive by making energy efficiencies andimproving business performance.
"The Chancellor's softening of the levy in last week's pre-Budget report, while welcome does not go far enough and businesses realise that there will be a high price to pay if they fail to make preparations."
Mr Jackson added: "Industries should not delay in reviewing their energy management strategies now.
"They may well find that hidden energy savings could bring significant benefits in the future."

Insurance risk not in the weather: [National Edition]

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/insurance-risk-not-weather/docview/329629013/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: The Daily Show, a satirical news report broadcast by the Comedy Channel in the United States, recently did a bit on how television news tends to treat every storm and hurricane movement as a looming and unprecedented mega-disaster. They called the phenomenon "The Storm of the Century of the Week." The timing was perfect. The bit coincided with the arrival of another hurricane off the U.S. coast. Before it had even touched land, the big U.S. networks were plotting a trail of destruction; Canada's networks were bringing in experts to compare it to Hurricane Hazel of 1954. In the end, nothing happened. The storm of the century of the week mostly sailed out to sea, more or less ending another routine hurricane season -- but not without again leaving the continent in a state of high anxiety over the weather.

Full text: The Daily Show, a satirical news report broadcast by the Comedy Channel in the United States, recently did a bit on how television news tends to treat every storm and hurricane movement as a looming and unprecedented mega-disaster.

Before it had even touched land, the big U.S. networks were plotting a trail of destruction; Canada's networks were bringing in experts to compare it to Hurricane Hazel of 1954. In the end, nothing happened. The storm of the century of the week mostly sailed out to sea, more or less ending another routine hurricane season -- but not without again leaving the continent in a state of high anxiety over the weather.
At least the Comedy Channel's writers have the wit to spot climatological nonsense. The same cannot be said for Canada's insurance industry, which yesterday jumped aboard the wild weather chuckwagon as part of its campaign to get governments to spend more money on risk-reducing infrastructure.
At a Toronto conference, the Insurance Bureau of Canada, through a subsidiary called the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction, claimed global warming was playing havoc with our weather and causing huge insurance losses. "The increase in extreme weather claims is part of a global trend in which climate change has played a significant role," said G. Terry Squire, chief executive of the Co- operators Group and chair of the loss reduction institute.
To back the claim on global warming, the insurance firms called in Gordon McBean, assistant deputy minister at Environment Canada. Mr. McBean is a well-known expert in the business of turning unproved speculation into words that make it sound like climate change is underway and is responsible for increasing bouts of bad weather. Even though there's no scientific evidence, Mr. McBean manages to get the message out anyway that greenhouse gas emissions are the cause of the Saguenay and Red River floods, the ice storm and other expensive insurance risks. Coming next are falling water levels in the Great Lakes, more storms, drought and other forms of climate chaos.
Despite the Insurance Bureau's claims about global warming, the world view on the subject is different. Swiss Reinsurance has been compiling stats on natural disasters since 1970. "Scientifically speaking, there is as yet no indication of a significant long-term change in the frequency of events which can be ascribed to climatic change," said the company in its latest report. "Science is concentrating increasingly on longer-range probability forecasts for natural events, with natural climatic variability being a central consideration." What that means is that whatever bad-weather events we have had in recent years, they are nothing unusual.
Canada's insurance industry may indeed be facing increasing claims and therefore losses, but they have nothing to do with climate change. The chart below shows that the increase in natural catasptrophes follows closely the increase in the much higher incidence of man-made disasters. This general increase in turn can be attributed to a number of different factors. The main factor is a sharp increase in reporting. A hurricane that landed on unoccupied land 30 years ago is today a reported event with claims and casualties. Natural disasters also include events that are unrelated to weather, such as earthquakes. Earthquakes, however, have not yet been linked to greenhouse gas emissions.
There's nothing wrong with trying to cut your losses. Indeed, insurers may have a genuine problem. Governments are not spending enough on the infrastructure needed to avoid costly insurance claims. Take flood control. If the sewage and water runoff trunk lines have not been maintained or have not kept up with population growth and water use habits, a storm could force back-ups into basements and cause other damage. Insurers would rather not pay the rising claims.
Risk avoidance is one thing, but jumping into bed with the global warming industry, including Environment Canada, is an unseemly display of opportunism. The price of misleading and distorting can sometimes be higher than the reward.

Sponsors of the "patients bill of rights" in Congress said United's decision proves their point.

Doctor-managed care
UnitedHealthcare, one of the nation's largest managed-care companies, said Monday that it will stop overruling doctors' decisions about what care patients should receive.
The company, which covers 14.5 million people nationwide, is abandoning a cornerstone of the managed-care industry's cost- containment strategy and one of the features most responsible for the outpouring of public ill will toward HMOs.
Sponsors of the "patients bill of rights" in Congress said United's decision proves their point. But Republican leaders said it confirms their view that market forces are working to correct any abuses by the managed-care insurance industry.
Taking it to heart
The good news was women who actually eat sensibly, don't smoke, get some exercise, keep the weight down and have an occasional drink can reduce their chance of heart disease an astonishing 82 percent.
The bad news was only 1 percent actually follow all the rules.
That's the latest from the landmark Nurses' Health Study, conducted at the Harvard School of Public Health. Presented Monday at an American Heart Association meeting in Atlanta, the findings highlight the paradox that relatively few people in this supposedly health-crazed land are indeed doing everything they can to avert the disease that is most likely to kill them.
POLITICS
McCain rallies
Suddenly, the front-runner is on the run.
An American Research Group poll showed Arizona Sen. John McCain in a statistical tie with George W. Bush in New Hampshire.
It is only one poll in only one state - the Texas governor holds an overwhelming lead over all rivals in national surveys - but McCain's surge threatens to reduce the value of one of Bush's greatest assets: the perception that his nomination is inevitable, and he is the best bet to reclaim the White House from Democrats.
Noblesse oblige to a fault
Donald Trump, political neophyte and presidential wannabe, has come up with a simple way to save Social Security, erase the national debt, and slash taxes for working Americans:
Gouge the rich.
Trump, toying with a bid for the Reform Party nomination, on Tuesday unveiled the highly unorthodox plan, which would slap fat cats such as The Donald himself with a one-time 14.25 percent tax on their entire net worth. Trump's personal contribution: $725 million.
The admittedly sketchy proposal, of Trump's own design, was immediately attacked by some financial experts, who worried such a drastic hit would set off a mad exodus of capital from the United States.
REGION
School shooter gets life
Kip Kinkel, the Oregon 17-year-old who killed his parents before going on a high school shooting rampage in Springfield, was sentenced Wednesday to serve nearly 112 years in prison, effectively the rest of his life.
He had admitted to killing his parents, Bill and Faith Kinkel, and two students - Mikael Nickolauson and Ben Walker - at Thurston High during two days in May 1998. Kinkel also admitted to trying to kill 25 students at Thurston and a police detective following his arrest.
Though he stood in court Wednesday and read a statement apologizing for his crimes, Kinkel seemed confused himself.
"I absolutely loved my parents and had no reason to kill them," he said. "I had no reason to dislike or kill or try to kill anyone at Thurston. I am truly sorry for all of this."
Arid Northwest
Five degrees may not sound like much, but by 2050 they'll make a world of difference to people living in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.
A University of Washington study of climate change says we can expect wetter winters, more flooding, fewer salmon, water shortages and drought-damaged forests.
"The consensus of climate scientists is that a warmer world in the next century is more than just a reasonable possibility ...," said Philip Mote, lead author of the new report.

Prudence imperfect: VIEWPOINT CHRIS HUMPHRIES: The chancellor made some welcome changes, but on some of the key issues for small businesses he failed to deliver: [London edition]

Author: Humphries, Chris

Abstract: All pre-Budget reports traditionally have catchy titles designed to set the tone for what lies within. While she only appeared twice in Gordon Brown's speech on Tuesday, it seemed his soulmate 'Prudence' may have written the decidedly non-sexy sound-bite for this year's statement - "Stability and steady growth for Britain". However, stability and steady growth, and the end of boom-and-bust cycles, are exactly what businesses have been calling on successive governments to deliver for many decades. The chancellor may have inherited a sound economic base from his Tory predecessors, but he has succeeded in securing a level of stability that consistently earns bouquets from businesses for his record on economic management. Although the pound remains too high, providing an additional challenge that our beleaguered exporters could well do without, Mr Brown's statement contained the key elements businesses need for continued economic stability - no big give-aways, and continued tight controls on public spending.

Full text: All pre-Budget reports traditionally have catchy titles designed to set the tone for what lies within. While she only appeared twice in Gordon Brown's speech on Tuesday, it seemed his soulmate 'Prudence' may have written the decidedly non-sexy sound-bite for this year's statement - "Stability and steady growth for Britain".
However, stability and steady growth, and the end of boom-and-bust cycles, are exactly what businesses have been calling on successive governments to deliver for many decades. The chancellor may have inherited a sound economic base from his Tory predecessors, but he has succeeded in securing a level of stability that consistently earns bouquets from businesses for his record on economic management.
Although the pound remains too high, providing an additional challenge that our beleaguered exporters could well do without, Mr Brown's statement contained the key elements businesses need for continued economic stability - no big give-aways, and continued tight controls on public spending.
'Enterprise' was far more popular than 'Prudence' on Tuesday, including the chancellor's welcome endorsement of the National Enterprise Campaign. But what else do enterprises need, and what did they get?
Growth businesses also need a tax regime that encourages longer-term investment and maximises global competitiveness.
The significant changes to the capital gains tax regime, including a cut in the rate and a reduction in the period for tapering relief to five years, were a very positive response to calls from small business organisations, including the British Chambers of Commerce, over the past five years.
It should have been a welcome addition to a UK business tax regime that had once been the envy of much of Europe, except that the envy is rapidly disappearing.
The BCC has calculated that the increases in business taxes from this government will amount to £30bn over the life of this parliament.
This calculation was confirmed last week when the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development announced That Britain has the fastest growing tax burden of any country in Europe, with the UK paying more tax than Germany for the first time in a generation. Treasury attempts to challenge these claims by semantic arguments over definitions cut no ice with businesses.
The pre-Budget package also contained other changes that businesses have asked for - the review of planning law; the new Investment Incentive and the already announced Regional Investment Funds to help close the equity investment gap for small businesses; the end to the fuel duty escalator; and changes to the climate change levy. The last two, however, appear to contain loopholes through which the government could easily drive a fleet of French fuel tankers.
Sadly, Mr Brown said almost nothing about the most significant barrier to small business competitiveness - the strangulating impact of new employment legislation and other regulatory burdens. A new minister to co-ordinate efforts to cut red-tape provides little comfort.
Despite all its rhetoric, this government, like all its recent predecessors, has sharply increased the regulatory burden on businesses. The UK has created more than 5,000 new regulations in the life of every recent parliament, with more than 2,700 new regulations before the half-way mark of this parliament.
The unpaid tax collector role for pay-as-you-earn and national insurance plus the new obligations to pay working family tax credit and collect student loans; the rules for the working time directive admitted by ministers to be excessive; the parental leave directive where the government refused to introduce a derogation for small businesses despite explicit provision for this in the directive; the minimum wage, accepted by the business community at the level set, but then surrounded by excessive record keeping and controls; value added tax regulations; the complex phasing rules of capital gains tax itself - the list goes on.
The real problem for enterprise and small businesses with this pre-Budget package is that, on the key issues of tax and regulation, it just tinkers round the edges. The Better Regulation Task Force and the Small Business Service must get real teeth on regulation; the chancellor should establish a Tax Simplification Task Force to do the same job for business taxation. Until then, the response from small businesses can only be 'good - but not nearly good enough'.

Elderly top Brown's TV ratings: [2 Edition]

Author: Brogan, Benedict; Political Editor

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/elderly-top-browns-tv-ratings/docview/332549151/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: With revised forecasts predicting robust economic growth, Mr Gordon Brown delighted Labour back benchers by scrapping the fuel- duty escalator, announcing free television licences for over-75s, and slashing capital gains tax for long-term investments in high-risk ventures to as low as 10%. But there was no disguising the possibilities opening up before him as he prepares to take Labour into the next General Election campaign, probably in spring 2001. The new spending round due to be announced next summer will give Mr Brown a chance to deploy his so- called war chest in the interests of securing a second term for Labour. Under changes announced yesterday, the fuel duty escalator which imposes real-terms increases of 6% each year in the price of petrol and diesel, will be abandoned. There had been claims it was crippling economic development in rural areas like the Highlands, which received a second boost when the Chancellor announced plans to scrap the existing air passenger duty for flights from airports in the Highlands and Islands.

With revised forecasts predicting robust economic growth, Mr Gordon Brown delighted Labour back benchers by scrapping the fuel- duty escalator, announcing free television licences for over-75s, and slashing capital gains tax for long-term investments in high-risk ventures to as low as 10%.
Faced with demands from trade unions and activists for increased spending, Mr Brown warned he would not risk "the future of our economy" by launching into a debate over how best to divide the "national wealth" produced by strict expenditure controls and better- than-expected economic growth. Experts suggest the Government may have as much as #20bn spare to spend.
But there was no disguising the possibilities opening up before him as he prepares to take Labour into the next General Election campaign, probably in spring 2001. The new spending round due to be announced next summer will give Mr Brown a chance to deploy his so- called war chest in the interests of securing a second term for Labour.
Under changes announced yesterday, the fuel duty escalator which imposes real-terms increases of 6% each year in the price of petrol and diesel, will be abandoned. There had been claims it was crippling economic development in rural areas like the Highlands, which received a second boost when the Chancellor announced plans to scrap the existing air passenger duty for flights from airports in the Highlands and Islands.
Although Mr Brown said increases may still be introduced on a Budget-by-Budget basis as part of the Government's commitment to the environment, any cash raised will go to a ring-fenced fund for road and public transport improvements.
This so-called hypothecation - assigning taxes to a particular purpose - will also be introduced next year for the annual 5% real- term increase in tobacco duty. Mr Brown said the #300m generated by Britain's cigarette habit would go to additional spending on the health service.
But there were doubts, voiced by the Opposition, that the carefully-targeted news in the Pre-Budget Report disguised creeping tax increases that are hitting entrepreneurs and damaging the economy's long-term prospects.
Figures published yesterday showed that while Britain avoided a recession last year, the Treasury has had to revise downwards its forecast growth in 2001 as the Bank of England's successive interest rate increases begin to bite.
The Treasury predicted rising Budget surpluses and uprated forecasts for economic growth: now estimated at 1.75% in the current year rising to between 2.5% and 3% next year, but dropping back to between 2.25% and 2.5% in 2001.
While Mr Brown hailed expected cash surpluses rising from #9.5bn this year to #13bn in 2001, adjusted figures suggest the surplus will in fact be #3.5bn this year, falling to #3bn in 2001.
There were also complaints that the Government had caved in to big business by diluting the impact of its proposed climate change levy. The changes to this levy work out as a 90% discount on the original proposals in return for agreed industry action to cut emissions of harmful "greenhouse" gases, a move condemned by environmentalists.
Mr Brown said he was laying the ground for a "decade of reform" where "enterprise and fairness can go hand in hand". He said his ambition for the next decade was to reduce child poverty by half in a decade, and to send half of all school leavers on to degrees. He told MPs it was time to move on from the "sterile century-long conflict between enterprise and fairness" which saw the left focus on a good society while the right promoted a good economy.
He announced that investors willing to put their money into new, riskier ventures will see capital gains tax drop dramatically, from 40% down to 22% for a three-year investment, and to just 10% for five years. It stunned the Tories.
Mr Brown also challenged companies to offer shares to their employees and as an inducement said the first #3000 of shares would be free of income tax and employees could buy another #1500 from their pre-tax salary, as part of his aim to open share ownership to all.
To encourage business in de-prived communities, there are initiatives designed to help entre- preneurs willing to take risks in inner cities with small grants of up to #4000 and help with computer and management training.
In another move, the Office of Fair Trading is to be given beefed- up "trust busting" powers, including the ability to impose fines of up to 30% of a firm's turnover, to tackle business cartels and anti- competitive behaviour. In addition Lord Grabiner QC has been appointed to head a task force to investigate ways of cracking down on the #50bn "black economy", with the prospect of imposing a tough new daily signing-on requirement for benefit claimants suspected of cheating.
For pensioners, the surprise announcement that households with an over-75 will from next autumn no longer have to pay for their #101 TV licence was coupled with a pledge to make the #100 winter fuel allowance a permanent pre-Christmas fixture.
As part of his drive to bring more people into work, Mr Brown announced a substantial extension of the New Deal which will be rolled out to take in all unemployed by offering them either a place on a training course or a job. A new Children's Fund will be developed to champion ways of integrating help for children.
The Tories dismissed the promise of free TV licences as a "gimmick" and accused the Chancellor of professing to be pro- business when, in reality he was pursuing anti-business policies.
Shadow Chancellor Francis Maude said angrily: "There is a new corruption investing British politics today: the corruption of the smug few who are trying to make mugs of the many."

Full text: Greens accuse the Chancellor of bowing to the business lobby and making a decision that will have no effect on traffic growth THE Chancellor yesterday infuriated environmentalists and delighted road users by announcing that the controversial mechanism for increasing fuel duty above inflation would be scrapped.
It had been widely tipped that the "fuel duty escalator" would be reviewed, though Mr Gordon Brown decided to go a step further.
However, he did say fuel duty increases would still be considered on a "Budget by Budget" basis, with cash from real term increases ring-fenced for spending on public transport and modernising the road network.
Other measures detailed by Mr Brown included a pledge to increase cuts in carbon pollution from 1.5m tonnes a year to 2m tonnes by 2010, and a decrease in the proposed climate change levy on polluters from #1750m to #1000m, with a 0.3% cut in employers' National Insurance contributions ensuring businesses would not lose out.
Renewable energy and combined heat and power are to be exempt, while the rate of the levy per kilowatt hour was cut from 0.21 pence to 0.15 pence for businesses complying with the scheme. Support for energy efficiency measures under the levy will be trebled to #150m.
Mr Brown hinted that an aggregates tax may still be introduced in the future, if the quarrying industry did not voluntarily improve its environmental record.
Further talks will take place on the use of pesticides before any tax on their use is imposed.
The Chancellor said: "The Government wants to ensure that economic growth takes place in a way which ensures the effective protection of the environment and the prudent use of natural resources."
Mr Brown said it was possible to scrap the fuel escalator, which was introduced in 1993 to increase fuel duty by 6% above inflation every year, because deficit cuts had been achieved and environmental policies introduced. He promised that any future real term rises in road fuel duties would be lower than in the past.
Mr Phil Flanders, regional director of the Road Haulage Association for Scotland, said the move was good news, but did not solve the problems faced by the haulage industry.
He said: "We are still paying twice as much for fuel as on the continent. Scottish hauliers are still suffering because we are uncompetitive with continental hauliers."
The RAC welcomed the "radical shift" in policy. A spokesman said: "We are glad to see the Chancellor has taken his foot off the fuel escalator.
"This is a step in the right direction, but it remains to be seen how much fuel duty will be increased by in the next Budget."
The AA also welcomed the commitment to scrap the escalator, but warned the pledge to invest cash raised from above-inflation fuel tax rises on roads and public transport must involve new money and not prove to be a "conjuring trick".
Business representatives gave a cautious welcome to the Chancellor's statement.
The Scottish Council Development and Industry said the abolition of the escalator was a "victory for common sense" and would improve competitiveness, but other groups questioned the cost of the climate change levy, particularly for the manufacturing sector.
Scotland's First Minister Donald Dewar said he "particularly welcomed the decision to step off the fuel duty price escalator".
He added that the decision to consult on an exemption from air passenger duty for flights from airports in the Scottish Highlands and Islands was an important recognition of the area's transport needs.
Political opponents gave a mixed reaction to the fuel duty announcement, most stressing that Mr Brown had failed to promise a freeze or reduction in real term increases.
SNP deputy leader John Swinney said: "Public pressure has forced Gordon Brown to slow his attacks on the motorist - but they are not stopping, and next year we will see further increases in prices at the pumps, which are already the highest in Europe."
Lothians Green MSP Robin Harper said the Chancellor had weakened under pressure from big business, particularly over the escalator.
He added: "This is just about the worst decision the Chancellor could have made. It was the one element of the tax system that might have had an effect on road traffic growth.
"The reality is that the Government has given up when the fuel duty escalator was beginning to bite."
Friends of the Earth Scotland said the Government had gone soft over its attitude to tackling transport emissions.
Head of research Dr Richard Dixon said: "Government cannot have a credible programme on climate change if they abandon the fuel duty escalator."
Sustainable transport group TRANSform Scotland said the Government had given in to the business lobby over the escalator.
Manager Colin Howden welcomed the climate change levy but questioned whether it would be as effective as the fuel tax at cutting pollution.

Abstract: THE planned energy tax will be watered down after the Chancellor heeded the strong warnings from industry that it would hit heavy users hard. The climate change levy, which will be introduced from April 2001, will be lowered to produce a total annual tax take of GBP 1 billion, rather than GBP 1.75 billion, and will exempt the "greenest" energy users. Mr Brown said he would reduce the proposed levy on major users of gas and coal to 0.15p per kilowatt hour from 0.21p. The electricity levy charged to major commercial and industrial users of electricity comes down to 0.43p from the 0.60p proposed in the March Budget.

Full text: THE planned energy tax will be watered down after the Chancellor heeded the strong warnings from industry that it would hit heavy users hard.
The climate change levy, which will be introduced from April 2001, will be lowered to produce a total annual tax take of GBP 1 billion, rather than GBP 1.75 billion, and will exempt the "greenest" energy users.
Mr Brown said he would reduce the proposed levy on major users of gas and coal to 0.15p per kilowatt hour from 0.21p. The electricity levy charged to major commercial and industrial users of electricity comes down to 0.43p from the 0.60p proposed in the March Budget.
An 80 per cent discount on the levy will be offered to energy intensive industry sectors that agree certain energy efficiency targets. All the revenues raised from the levy will be recycled to business through a 0.3 percentage point reduction in employer's National Insurance contribution.
Mr Brown said: "The Government wants to ensure that economic growth takes place in a way which ensures the effective protection of the environment and the prudent use of natural resources."
The lighter touch from the Treasury comes after consultation with industry and environmental groups. But the amended proposals produced a mixed reaction, with some bodies saying the changes did not go far enough.
Peter Hughes, the chief executive of Scottish Engineering, said: "The Chancellor has tried to spin his way out of the controversy surrounding the climate change levy without actually doing much to improve the situation for the manufacturing sector.
"Only the energy intensive users are eligible for the 80 per cent discount quoted by the Chancellor. The burden on others will therefore be proportionately higher."
Ian Blakely, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said: "The lower tax rate and 80 per cent tax reduction for intensive users is a step in the right direction, but any residual tax burden reduces the money industry has to invest in environmental improvement."
Allan Hogarth of the CBI Scotland said: "We welcome the fact that the Chancellor has gone a long way to meeting our concerns but we will need to study the details carefully to see whether these reforms are sufficient for the most adversely affected sectors.
"We still remain concerned about the lack of any firm proposals for extending negotiated agreements for emissions trading."
Martin Gale, managing director of Caledonian Paper at Irvine, Ayrshire, a high energy user, said the Chancellor had gone a long way to meet his stated aim of producing measures for enterprise and fairness. On the previous proposals Caledonian Paper, owned by UPM- Kymmene, would have faced a bill of GBP 1.2 million.
Mr Gale said: "Providing there are no other hurdles we can look forward to UPM-Kymmene investing more in the mill at Caledonian."

Tax breaks for risk-takers who show enterprise: [3RD Edition]

Abstract: Capital gains tax on business investment will be cut progressively, to encourage investors to take a long-term stake in a business.

That burden will be reduced by 6 per cent a year, so that after three years the tax rate will be 22 per cent and after five years it will be cut to just ten. The Chancellor has been persuaded to adopt the five-year time-scale because of the speed of growth of hi-tech companies, particularly Internet companies. They are frequently created, prosper and are then taken over within a few years. Mr Brown called the move a 'radical reform to promote long-term investment across the economy.' It builds on a system of CGT relief introduced last year. That allowed for the tax liability on shareholdings to be cut progressively over ten years.

Full text:   ENTREPRENEURS were offered a generous tax break as part of the Chancellor's campaign to promote enterprise across the economy.
Capital gains tax on business investment will be cut progressively, to encourage investors to take a long-term stake in a business. The longer the investment is held, the lower the tax paid.
A top rate taxpayer currently pays 40 per cent capital gains tax on his investment.
That burden will be reduced by 6 per cent a year, so that after three years the tax rate will be 22 per cent and after five years it will be cut to just ten. The Chancellor has been persuaded to adopt the five-year time-scale because of the speed of growth of hi-tech companies, particularly Internet companies.
They are frequently created, prosper and are then taken over within a few years. Mr Brown called the move a 'radical reform to promote long-term investment across the economy.' It builds on a system of CGT relief introduced last year. That allowed for the tax liability on shareholdings to be cut progressively over ten years.
Mr Brown faced fierce criticism because the move brought a massive potential windfall to some of the wealthiest people in the country. These included his Government colleague Lord Sainsbury and millionaire former Paymaster General Geoffrey Robinson, who helped draft the original legislation.
Similar criticism is certain to be levelled at the new tax break.
But the Chancellor is prepared to face the flak in his pursuit of generating a stronger entrepreneurial attitude. He believes it has been held back for too long because of the lack of rewards for risk- takers and is determined to rectify that.
'For too long British investment has been too low, productivity increases too slow, the potential of new markets, new technologies and new skills too often squandered', he told MPs.
'Britain has only half the rate of business start-ups and only half the rate of share ownership of the U.S., where nearly 50 per cent of people own shares.
'The British economy needs high levels of investment and entrepreneurship and I propose measures to encourage more investment and to give more people the chance to invest.' The move will reinforce the Chancellor's standing in the City. The Treasury will consult widely on the CGT change before implementing it.
Case study
THE capital gains tax changes have given a fillip to hairdresser Sally Phillipps and engineering boss Bryan Treherne.
Miss Phillipps, 35, put her home on the line to raise 30,000 to open a hairdressing salon in Clevedon, Somerset.
She left her safe job as a stylist in another salon to go it alone and put her house up as security against a 20,000 bank loan.
The Chancellor's measures have bolstered her belief she has done the right thing: 'Up until now there has been no advantage to make a profit or invest money,' she said.
'I want to open up more shops and this will really encourage us to do things. There has been a lot for workers over the last few years and little for employers like me.
'This is a real incentive to make the business work knowing that, when the time comes to take my money out, I won't have to hand over a large chunk to the taxman.
'It is an incentive to invest without the fear of being penalised down the line.' As managing director, Mr Treherne owns 48 per cent of hi-tech engineering company Paar Scientific Ltd, which he set up with three colleagues in 1982.
It made a profit of 150,000 last year on a turnover of 2million and, over the last ten years, Mr Treherne, 60, from Croydon, South London, has invested about 100,000.
He was planning to sell his share in the company rather than invest in it because of the high tax rate. Now he will save 30 per cent of the profits on his 375,000 share.
He said: 'This is very positive.
Up to last year, when I retired - as I mean to do in five years' time - I would have to pay 40 per cent on my total investment in the company. Now I can leave my money in there and pay just ten per cent capital gains tax. It means I may put another 100,000 into the firm which will then probably employ more people as the company expands.
'Overall I hope this change will encourage people to invest in businesses.
'It is a step in the right direction.'
Venture capital
TAX relief will be given to companies that invest venture capital in small, higher-risk businesses from next year. Mr Brown also announced the creation of Venture Capital Funds in every region to promote risk-taking enterprises which often find it hard to attract conventional investment from banks. He highlighted an announcement by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) this week that it will set up its European centre in Cambridge.
From next year, regionally-based Enterprise Centres attached to universities will be able to draw on the management and research expertise of the new MIT-Cambridge partnership 'and put it to work for every region in Britain'.
Environment tax
MR BROWN recognised the justice of industry protests and watered down his main 'green tax' aimed at cleaning up the environment.
The Climate Change Levy - originally proposed in the March Budget - would have slapped a heavy new tax on industries which are major users of power.
Now Mr Brown is to scale it back even before it is introduced.
The tax, due to come into effect next year, would have raised 1.7bil-lion in an attempt to encourage energy conservation. Yesterday Mr Brown announced that the levy will be reduced to 1billion in total, and industries will receive a rebate of up to 80 per cent if they agree a programme of energy savings.
All the revenue raised from the new levy will be recycled back into British industry by making an across the board cut of 0.3 per cent in employer National Insurance contributions.
Industrialists protested that the levy would cost thousands of jobs and add unfairly to the costs of energy-intensive industries. Combined heat and power and renewable energy sources will be exempted from the levy.
Mr Brown claimed the changes would actually lead to a bigger reduction in pollutants but environmental groups accused him of caving in to industry.
A Greenpeace spokesman said: 'The climate change levy has become the no-change levy because the Government has put the needs of the old smokestack industries first.
'This is a climbdown and shows that Gordon Brown is running scared from a small number of energy-intensive industries at the expense of the climate and those businesses which are energy efficient.
While the exemption of renewable energy is welcome, this announcement shows that Brown is a long way from being green.' But Friends of the Earth said: 'The statement was not as bad as it could have been; he has stuck to his guns on the principle of the levy.' The CBI said: 'We are very pleased by the rebate and we think it is absolutely right for more incentives for energy efficiency.'
Fuel duty escalator
THERE was long-overdue cheer for motorists when Mr Brown scrapped the fixed annual above-inflation increase in petrol and diesel taxes.
The Chancellor said the 6 per cent levy, known as the fuel duty escalator, would be replaced with 'budget by budget' decisions on duty increases.
He also promised that future rises would be ring-fenced for roads and public transport.
But the announcement fell short of a promise that there would not be swingeing rises in future and the Road Haulage Association expressed concern that Mr Brown was 'juggling with words' rather than addressing drivers' high costs.
Motorists and the freight transport industry have long hated the fuel escalator, introduced by the Tories to raise money to curb the Government spending deficit. Hauliers claimed the resulting price rises made their industry hopelessly uncompetitive against continental truck firms.
Some British companies say they have been forced to move their businesses across the Channel to remain viable.
Rural motorists, who pay some of the highest fuel prices in areas where there is little or no public transport, had also been furious.
Mr Brown has chosen to act because the escalator had become politically unsustainable.
The Freight Transport Association, which has long campaigned for the abolition of the escalator, welcomed the announcement but warned there was still a long way to go.
It demanded further action to redress the competitive disadvantages caused by the system and urged the Government to do more to create a level playing field.
David Green, the FTA's director general said: 'We need to ensure that fuel duties do not rise above inflation at the next Budget.' The RAC was suspicious, warning it 'remains to be seen' how much duty would go up in the next Budget. The AA cautioned that the pledge had better not be a 'conjuring trick'.
For the Tories, shadow spokesman Bernard Jenkin said the Chancellor's announcement was not what it seemed. 'He has given no assurances at all,' he said.
Environmental group Transport 2000 welcomed the Chancellor's announcement of increased funding for public transport but expressed concern over the scrapping of the escalator.
Spokesman Steve Hounsham said: 'We have long argued for increased funding of public transport but want to see a continued increase in taxes on fuel to persuade motorists to use their cars less.'

Abstract: Mr [GORDON BROWN] pleased the Green lobby by resisting attempts to get him to drop the energy tax, which much of Britain's heavy industry has regarded with dread. Environmentalists were also happy at his proposal to exempt renewable energy and the energy- efficient technology known as combined heat and power. The Chancellor thinks that bringing in energy-saving schemes will produce much greater cuts in the CO2 emitted from power-station chimneys than previously thought. He said he now thinks the tax can cut 2bn tonnes of annual emissions from smokestack firms, rather than the 1.5bn tonnes estimated earlier this year.

Full text: GORDON BROWN continued to build a reputation as the Green Chancellor, announcing a number of measures designed to help the environment, welcomed by both industry and environmentalists.
He is pressing ahead with an energy tax, one of the Government's main weapons in the struggle to cut carbon dioxide emissions, providing a massive sum for energy-efficiency technology, and ring- fencing future money from petrol duty for transport investment.
Mr Brown pleased the Green lobby by resisting attempts to get him to drop the energy tax, which much of Britain's heavy industry has regarded with dread. Environmentalists were also happy at his proposal to exempt renewable energy and the energy- efficient technology known as combined heat and power.
However, he pleased industry by making significant concessions to the most energy-intensive sectors, such as steel, aluminium and cement companies. This will slash the tax take from the proposed figure of pounds 1.7bn annually to pounds 1bn. All the money will be recycled to firms in reduced national insurance contributions.
The Chancellor thinks that bringing in energy-saving schemes will produce much greater cuts in the CO2 emitted from power-station chimneys than previously thought. He said he now thinks the tax can cut 2bn tonnes of annual emissions from smokestack firms, rather than the 1.5bn tonnes estimated earlier this year.
But Mr Brown called a halt to the fuel duty escalator, the automatic annual rise in petrol tax by 6 per cent over inflation.
He delighted environmentalists by trebling the moneyavailable for energy- efficiency schemes from pounds 50m to pounds 150m.
"We are in general very pleased, although the devil will be in the detail of these policies," said Dr Ute Collier, head of climate change at the World Wide Fund for Nature.
"Mr Brown has gone a long way to meeting our concerns," said Michael Roberts, head of industry policy at the CBI.

Full text: The full text of the chancellor's speech: Madam Speaker.
The challenge a year ago amid global turbulence and predictions of recession was to steer a course of stability. Now with this year's pre-Budget report, the challenge is to lock in that stability and - by pressing ahead with our economic reforms - to set the course for a Britain of stability and steady growth.
The reforms made and the reforms to be made today reflect our resolve: that Britain must leave behind the sterile century-long conflict between enterprise and fairness - between the left, which promoted the good society at the expense of the good economy, and the right which promoted the good economy at the expense of the good society, and too often achieved neither.
Only by pursuing both enterprise for all and fairness for all can we equip all of Britain for the future and secure rising living standards for all.
Having laid the foundations with our monetary and fiscal reforms, Britain can now aspire to a new economic ambition for the next decade: a faster rise in productivity than our main competitors, as we close the productivity gap.
Making the most of our economic potential depends upon employing all the talents of all the people. So, building on our educational reforms and £19bn of new investment, the government's second ambition for the next decade is that all people gain the highest qualifications they can, with a majority of our school-leavers going on to degrees for the first time in our history.
And, having modernised with the New Deal and our reforms to make work pay, Britain can now reach for a third ambition in the next decade: a higher percentage of people in work than ever before.
Because a fair society and the strongest possible economy depend upon leaving no one behind, Britain must build on the reforms taking nearly 1m children out of poverty and give every child the best possible start in life.
So our fourth ambition is - by the end of the next decade - child poverty reduced by half - on our way to ending child poverty within 20 years.
Decisions for a decade of reform - to create a Britain of prosperity for all - as together we create a Britain where there is opportunity for all. Stability The foundation, our first priority, yesterday, today and tomorrow, is to lock in fiscal and monetary stability. The economy of 1997 was characterised by rising inflationary pressures; unsustainable consumer spending; a large structural deficit in the public finances with public sector borrowing of £28bn; indeed, Madam Speaker, Britain was set to repeat the same old cycle of boom and bust.
Since then we have created and rigorously adhered to a new framework of modern economic management: a clearly defined inflation target and clear fiscal rules - based on legislating for an independent Bank of England and a regime of fiscal stability.
Over the last year, inflation has remained around or at our target. And today underlying inflation is at 2.1 per cent. Expectations of inflation 10 years on were 4.3 per cent when we came to power. They are now at 2.5 per cent.
Having come this far we will not relax our discipline.
Our pre-Budget report is based on meeting the inflation target of 2.5 per cent, not just this year but next year and the year after that.
Early action on interest rates now prevents a return to the drastic action of the past. Those who would refuse to take the necessary pre-emptive decisions to meet the inflation target would risk returning our economy to the days of inflation out of control, unbalanced economic growth and 15 per cent interest rates. Under this government, Britain will not return to the boom and bust of the past.
Discipline is even more essential because of the changed global context. Last year, North America was the engine for world growth. Now this year, Europe and Japan are once again making their contribution. But, while the 1998 challenge to avoid recession has been met, the new challenge to grow while controlling inflation must make us all vigilant.
I come now to the economic forecasts.
Last November I said that I expected growth in 1999 to be 1 to 1.5 per cent, a forecast I reaffirmed in the Budget I presented last March.
I have been re-reading the debates that took place at that time. There were predictions of recession from experts and others. The whole House will be pleased to know that, as the government forecast, the economy has continued to grow.
The Treasury forecast is that growth this year will be 1.75 per cent. I can also report to the House that the Treasury forecast for next year is that the economy will grow by 2.5 to 3 per cent, and in 2001 and 2002 it will grow by 2.25 to 2.75 per cent - at all times consistent with meeting the inflation target.
Britain is steering a course of stability and steady growth. And we will not take risks with the future of the economy.
In our first two years, public borrowing has been reduced by £30bn - a cumulative fiscal tightening of 3 per cent of GDP - and we will continue to lock in that fiscal tightening by keeping the public finances under control.
Our first fiscal rule - the golden rule - is that over the cycle there is a current surplus. At this stage in the financial year I can provide an interim update on the Budget figures.
The Treasury forecast for this financial year, 1999-2000, is that the current Budget will be in surplus by £9.5bn.
I have said we will not make the old mistake of confusing a cyclical surplus with a structural surplus. In subsequent years, the surplus is forecast to be plus 11, 13, 13, 12 and 11.
I can therefore report that based on prudent and cautious assumptions audited by the National Audit Office we are on course to balance the current Budget over the cycle.
Our second fiscal rule - the sustainable investment rule - is that debt is set at a sustainable and prudent level. Under the last government national debt doubled from £166bn to £348bn.
In the last three years, debt's share of national income has fallen from 44 per cent to 42 per cent to an estimated 38.2 per cent at the end of this financial year, and to 37 per cent next year. Over the economic cycle we will keep debt below 40 per cent of national income.
As a result of falling levels of debt and lower long-term interest rates, interest payments are down each year by over £4bn. Money available for public services. For all those who have an interest in EMU (economic and monetary union), I can report - following in the tradition of my predecessor - that this year and in future years Britain will be well within the Maastricht criteria.
Having inherited a deficit of £28bn, I can now report that in the year ending March 1999 we repaid debt by a total of £2.5bn. This year we expect to repay debt by a total of £3.5bn.
A total of £6bn in debt repaid in two years.
At the right time in the economic cycle.
Consistent with our fiscal rules that we balance the current Budget and borrow only for investment, our forecasts for public sector net borrowing in future years are -3, -3, plus 1 and plus 4.
The British economy is clearly on track to meet our fiscal rules.
In the past, as figures for surpluses and deficits were reported, Budget debates too complacently focused on dividing up the national wealth.
Today, in a competitive global economy, Budgets must meet the long-term challenge of expanding the national wealth.
Indeed, living standards can continue rising only if Britain continues modernising. So, on the foundation of monetary and fiscal reform, we must build a pro-investment, pro-competition, pro-enterprise Britain to meet our first economic ambition, to raise our productivity towards the world's best. Enterprise for all For too long British investment has been too low, productivity increases too slow, the potential of new markets, new technologies and new skills too often squandered.
Today, Britain has only half the rate of business start-ups and only half the rate of share ownership of the USA, where nearly 50 per cent of people own shares. The British economy needs high levels of investment and entrepreneurship and I now propose new measures to encourage more investment and to give more people the chance to invest.
We have already cut small companies tax from 23p to 20p, introduced a starting rate of small business tax at 10p in the pound, cut mainstream corporation tax from 33p to 30p to its lowest ever level, and introduced first-year investment incentives that are of special help to manufacturing.
I now propose to go further.
Under governments of both parties capital gains tax for every investment, from the most productive to the most speculative, has been at 40 per cent.
For years as a country we have debated why long-term investment in Britain has been so low. A 40 per cent rate of tax on long-term investment discourages the capital formation and sustained reinvestment Britain needs to reach our full economic potential.
In the 1998 Budget we took the first step by reducing capital gains tax on investments of 10 years or more. Subject to consultation on the details, the Budget will make a more radical reform to promote not just high-tech investment, but long-term investment across the economy in Britain.
I will say to Britain's prospective and actual investors and entrepreneurs: invest for three years and the capital gains tax rate will not be 40 per cent but 22 per cent. Invest for five years and the tax rate will not be 40 per cent, or 22 per cent - it will be 10 per cent.
Having cut taxes for individuals who invest in businesses, my second major tax reform is to cut taxes for companies which invest.
In competitor countries, growing companies do well because large companies invest in them.
Tomorrow the secretary of state for trade and industry will give full details of a substantial tax incentive to generate new jobs in Britain from corporate venturing.
Large companies that invest in growing companies for a specified period will, from next year, receive a tax relief of 20 per cent, underwriting one-fifth of their investment.
And companies which reinvest gains in new ventures will be able to defer tax on capital gains.
This £100m incentive can bring Britain additional investment of £500m every year.
I turn now to the details of a third tax reform designed to create both a high-investment economy and a wealth-owning democracy open to all. I can announce that, under our new employee share ownership reform, all shares held for five years will be exempt from both income tax and capital gains tax.
From April, four months from now, employees will be able to receive shares worth up to £3,000 in their companies, free of income tax, giving a tax saving of up to £1,200. Employees will be able to purchase £1,500 pounds of additional shares from their pre-tax salary - giving a tax saving of up to £600 a year.
And for those who purchase shares, employers will able to award an additional £3,000 of shares, another tax saving of up to £1,200. This is the most generous all-employee shares incentive a British government has ever introduced. And it is open to all in every firm.
I urge employees and employers together to consider long-term investments in their firm's success.
In preference to inflationary wage rises, which in the end bring higher interest rates, choose stake-holdings which can bring real gains.
Enterprise for all calls for a larger number of small businesses - and so the pre-Budget report provides details of new incentives for small businesses - the backbone of our economy: a new enterprise grant, enterprise incentives for managers, and a new research and development tax credit targeted to small business, the most generous this country has ever seen, worth £150m a year.
Enterprise for all demands balanced economic growth across all the regions and nations of Britain.
So, through Regional Development Agencies and the work of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations, locally based venture capital funds will now be set up in every region of our country.
Yesterday, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced it will locate its European centre in Britain. From next year the new regionally based enterprise centres attached to our universities will be able to draw on the management and research expertise of the new MIT-Cambridge partnership and put it to work for every region of Britain.
Enterprise for all depends on opening up competition to all. It is time to build on this government's decision to create a new independent competition authority.
For cartels and anti-competitive behaviour, the Office of Fair Trading will, from March next year, be given new investigative resources and trust-busting weapons, including the power to impose fines of up to 30 per cent of turnover.
For banking and financial services, the Financial Services Authority will now, for the first time, be required to facilitate competition - with a new scrutiny role for the competition authorities.
For the professions, the government will examine how best to ensure that the rules of professional bodies do not unnecessarily restrict or distort competition.
For the regulatory system, and following the Cruickshank interim report, the government will consider how to scrutinise regulatory bodies and review existing and proposed regulations to ensure that they are promoting - not impeding - new entrants and competitive forces.
For the planning system, the deputy prime minister is today announcing a series of changes in planning guidelines that will, for the first time, facilitate the formation of high-tech clusters. For the first time the planning system will be required to promote competition.
For high-tech businesses that need key skills, we will reform the rules on work permits and open them up to essential workers in information technologies and to entrepreneurs.
And for the utilities, the forthcoming Utility Reform Bill will explicitly require the regulators for gas, electricity and water to promote competition. In sum, Britain open to competition, fair to consumers and at the leading edge of change. We are determined that Britain will break out of the closed circle which in the past has too often restricted enterprise to a few.
We want to encourage those who start with nothing and who, in the past, thought they could never reach higher or rise far - and tell them too that there is not only a chance to do better but no limit on their ambitions for themselves and their children. Our poor communities do not need more benefit offices - they need more businesses creating more jobs.
So we are resolved to extend the opportunities of enterprise to people and places the economy has too long forgotten.
The New Deal will now offer help for long-term unemployed to become self-employed and to start a business. For the over-50s, up to £3,000 during the first year in business and in work.
Help for prospective businesses will be available from a new enterprise development fund which we are creating and we will also provide cash help for people moving from benefits to business including support for micro-loans for small business investment.
Our proposals will also include new scholarships for dynamic business people in our poorest areas to learn new management skills.
To encourage the next generation of young entrepreneurs, we aim to double to 200,000 the number of pupils able to benefit from entrepreneurship courses in our schools.
And with support already pledged from our most successful businessmen and women we will launch a new national campaign for enterprise, under which schools and colleges will be directly partnered with local companies.
Britain needs radical improvements not only in enterprise but also in education.
For we are determined to achieve another ambition by the end of the next decade - to realise the prime minister's commitment to education - the highest standards in our schools, all young people gaining the highest possible qualifications, the majority of school-leavers gaining degrees.
In addition to the University for Industry, individual learning accounts, the expansion of further and higher education places by 800,000 and meeting new targets for literacy and numeracy in our schools, the secretary of state for education, who has pioneered these reforms, will announce a major new expansion in IT education and skills - including 50,000 new college places, because in the new knowledge economy no one should be left out. Employment I turn now to our ambition of work for all. A higher percentage of men and women employed than ever before.
I can report that after 2{1/2} years of this government, unemployment is now lower than at any time in the last 20 years. This government has not only delivered the New Deal, but delivered new jobs - 700,000 more since 1997.
And the minimum wage and working families tax credit are making work pay.
But we need to go further.
There are today 1m job vacancies waiting to be filled and vacancies are at record levels, not in one region alone, but in every region of the United Kingdom.
We need to equip the unemployed with all the skills they need for all the jobs that exist.
So I can announce to the House that the New Deal first introduced for the under-25s will be extended to all those over 25 in every part of the country. Options will include:
* the offer of a job with a private sector employer;
* self-employment;
* work based retraining;
* or college training.
Backed up by advice counselling and mentoring.
I can also announce today new choices for lone parents to get new skills, go to college and go to work. From now on, lone parents will not only be able to train for jobs while receiving income support, but I can announce that they will also benefit from college-based childcare places for 10,000 more children, making a total of 37,000 in all. All lone parents with children above three will receive notice of these new choices.
In 1909 Britain created the first Labour Exchange in the world - to link potential employees to vacant jobs. And today, with 1m vacancies spread throughout the country, Britain must use the most modern technology to match the jobs without workers to the workers without jobs.
We will now create a national jobs phone-line under which, for the first time, in every locality, the employment service will continuously update unemployed men and women about new vacancies suitable for their skills.
For every constituency in the country, the government will provide assistance for members of parliament, irrespective of political party, to bring the unemployed and potential employers together.
Our reforms since 1997 have cut youth and long-term unemployment by half.
A return to full employment was once a dream. It is now not only a promise but a possibility. In the next decade if we stay the course of reform it can become one of our country's proudest achievements.
And, as we extend opportunities to those who are out of work, we will extend the responsibility to take up the work on offer. The informal or hidden economy is now draining billions of pounds in fraudulent benefit claims and unpaid taxes.
This loss of revenues, this incidence of fraud, this waste of resources, cannot be allowed to continue and especially when there are jobs that benefit claimants could take.
Lord Grabiner QC, will chair a task force bringing together the Treasury, the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise, the Department of Social Security and the Employment Service. He will investigate the scale of the problem and the cost to the taxpayer, recommend a plan of action and set a timetable to crack down on the hidden economy.
He will examine ways to move economic activity from illegitimate to legitimate businesses. He will consider increased fines for fraud and new requirements specifically for those suspected of being in the hidden economy - to sign on for benefit not every fortnight, but every single day.
I say to the unemployed who can work: we will meet our responsibility to ensure there are job opportunities and the chance to learn new skills.
You must now meet your responsibility - to earn a wage. And we are ensuring work pays more than benefits.
All our measures for work, taken together, mark a new dividing line. This government believes that the way to help the unemployed is extending the New Deal, not abolishing it.
As we pursue our ambitions for growth and jobs, we can and must keep our environmental commitments. Under the deputy prime minister, Britain took the lead in successfully negotiating the Kyoto Agreement.
And I am today announcing the results of our consultation with business on the climate change levy. Our original proposal cut carbon environmental pollution by 2010 by 1.5m tonnes a year.
Our consultation has shown that we can cut environmental pollution even further, by 2010 - by a total of over 2m tonnes a year - and at the same time cut the levy from £1.7bn to £1bn.
I have decided that renewable energy sources and combined heat and power will be exempt from the levy. The main rate per kilowatt hour will be cut from 0.21 to 0.15 pence. And there will now be an 80 per cent discount to energy intensive sectors signing energy efficiency agreements.
Taken together, these changes approach a 90 per cent discount on the levy published at Budget time in return for agreed industry action to cut emissions. All the revenues raised will be recycled to business.
I can confirm that every business will receive a tax cut of 0.3 percentage points in employer national insurance contributions.
And I have ensured that this package is not only revenue neutral for business and revenue neutral between manufacturing and services but even after the national insurance change there is no gain to the public purse.
In the run-up to the Budget we will consult on a new 100 per cent first-year investment allowance for companies moving from environmentally unfriendly to environmentally friendly technologies and processes.
I propose to make available not, as originally announced, £50m, but in its first year a total of £150m to support energy efficiency in British industry.
With all our measures, Britain is on track to meet our country's Kyoto target.
The fuel escalator was inherited from the previous government. Since 1997 the escalator has been needed to reduce the £28bn deficit we inherited as we put in place our new measures to protect the environment.
Those who have opposed the escalator - including some who originally imposed it - have to explain how, without it, they would have cut the deficit, made money available for public services and in the last two years been meeting our environmental commitments.
Having cut the deficit and introduced our new environmental policies, we are now in a position - instead of the pre-announced 6 per cent escalator - to make our decisions Budget by Budget with the following commitment: if there are any real term rises in road fuel duties, they will be lower and the revenues will go straight to a ring-fenced fund for the modernisation of roads and public transport.
Now that the return leg exemption of air passenger duty has been declared in breach of single market law I am today starting a pre-Budget consultation on replacing it with a new lower rate for lower fares. These changes will be revenue neutral.
Today I am also implementing recommendations that have come from Martin Taylor to prevent, detect and punish tobacco smuggling.
Smuggling is now costing us £2.5bn a year. The pre-Budget report contains details of our decisions - new scanners at major ports to detect contraband goods; new cigarette pack marks; and new and tougher fines and penalties for those who smuggle and those who sell smuggled goods.
I turn now to our next ambition - to reduce and then abolish child poverty in Britain. The promise of the next decade and the new century should be not just for some children but for every one of Britain's children.
By April, child benefit for the first child will be £15.
By the next April, for the typical family, child benefit and the children's tax credit will be £23. And with our 10p starting rate of income tax and the cut from 23p to 22p in the basic rate, the tax burden - national insurance as well as income tax - for the average family will be cut to its lowest level for 25 years.
Our intention is to integrate the children's tax credit and the child elements of working families tax credit and income support into one single credit paid direct to the mother - built on the foundation of universal child benefit.
At today's prices it would mean child payments starting at £15 a week in contrast to £11 in 1997 and, for the poorest child, rising to over £40 a week.
In our pre-Budget consultations we will also examine whether through the working families tax credit or other measures we can give more help to the mother who wishes to stay at home in the first months after her child is born.
Government must do more, but government on its own cannot win the war against child poverty. It can only be won by the combined energies of public private and voluntary sectors working together.
We need not only cash but caring.
So the pre-Budget report will consult on new reforms to support the community organisations that are closest to people and where dedicated staff and volunteers can offer one-to-one help.
First a new children's fund which will provide project grants for community action to tackle all aspects of child poverty.
Second, so we can develop new and innovative ways to support families and children, Sure Start will now see resources devolved not just to local government but to local partnerships led by neighbourhoods and the voluntary sector.
Third, for too long the voluntary sector has been held back by outdated tax laws.
We propose that in future, for every pound a British citizen donates to charity, the government will contribute to that charity an additional 28p.
And for every pound contributed through payroll-giving, the government will contribute not 28p but up to 50p worth of tax relief.
And there will now be tax relief, not just for cash donations to charities, but for gifts of quoted shares.
The British people's willingness to give can give all our children a better chance and all of us a better society.
From a platform of a stable economy and sustainable finances we are delivering £40bn extra for health and education.
And it is only by continuing our policies for stability and steady growth that we will be able to achieve a further ambition for Britain, to build the best public services.
In our second comprehensive spending review, to be completed next year, we will match investment with reform - increasing the amount of resources available for the NHS and education in our public services.
I can announce two decisions that can be made now.
Through the windfall levy, 5,000 schools throughout Britain have already been modernised.
With the addition of a further £150m, to the £4bn already allocated for schools capital, the secretary of state for education will be able to treble that figure.
By 2001 the number of schools modernised or being modernised will total 15,000, half the schools of Britain, benefiting over 5m pupils.
There is a strong public health case for year-on-year real term increases in the price of cigarettes.
While we will now make our decisions Budget by Budget, I can announce a new approach: the extra revenues from a 5 per cent real terms rise in cigarette duties would go straight to additional investment in the National Health Service, worth £300m a year, £300m extra for hospitals and healthcare which could start next April.
I have a further announcement to make.
From this week the £100 winter allowance is being paid to every pensioner household in Britain.
The secretary of state for social security will announce later today that the winter allowance will not just be paid this year but next year and every year from now on.
For pensioners with incomes above benefit level who are not wealthy, we propose a better deal on savings. The elderly especially will benefit from my proposal to cut the starting rate of tax on savings from 20p to 10p - 1.5m pensioners will benefit.
I have one final announcement.
All governments have agreed that we ought to provide the most help for our most elderly citizens - those over 75 or 80 who are more likely to be in poverty and more likely to have special needs.
Some have suggested a new age-related addition to benefits. Some have suggested the way to do this is to provide the very elderly with a reduction in the TV licence fee. I have rejected that option.
Instead, from next autumn, pensioners 75 or over - every pensioner aged 75 or more - will receive their television licence free of charge.
At a cost of £300m a year, every one of the 3m households with a pensioner over 75 will be able to save £101 a year.

Abstract: Gordon Brown yesterday invoked the spirit of Silicon Valley with a package of tax reforms to promote share ownership and stimulate investment in high-tech companies. In his pre-Budget report, the chancellor also announced an extension of US-style welfare reforms forcing the unemployed to take training or jobs. The prize of compelling people to work would be a return to full employment - "once a dream . . . now not only a promise, but a possibility". Mr Brown abolished the controversial "escalator" of substantial annual increases in road fuel duty and confirmed that pressure from industry had persuaded him to cut the burden of a proposed energy tax.

Full text: Gordon Brown yesterday invoked the spirit of Silicon Valley with a package of tax reforms to promote share ownership and stimulate investment in high-tech companies.
In his pre-Budget report, the chancellor also announced an extension of US-style welfare reforms forcing the unemployed to take training or jobs. The prize of compelling people to work would be a return to full employment - "once a dream . . . now not only a promise, but a possibility".
The chancellor also promised to reform tight planning laws to allow the development of high-tech clusters in greenfield sites.
Mr Brown abolished the controversial "escalator" of substantial annual increases in road fuel duty and confirmed that pressure from industry had persuaded him to cut the burden of a proposed energy tax.
His package, intended to promote "enterprise for all, and fairness" came against a backdrop of strong public finances and rising economic growth.
There were significant tax concessions for employees acquiring £7,500 of shares in their own companies.
And to promote business investment, Mr Brown changed the capital gains tax regime he launched only last year. A rate of 10 per cent will now be payable after a business asset has been held for five years rather than 10.
Among more populist initiatives were free television licences for the over-75s and new tax concessions for charitable giving.
Mr Brown faced continued controversy over whether alleged tax rises "by stealth" were increasing the share of the economy taken by taxation. Mr Brown denied that the tax burden was rising but Francis Maude, his Tory shadow, accused him of fiddling the figures.
The chancellor announced that the Treasury's forecast for growth this year had been raised to 1.75 per cent, from a range of 1 to 1.5 per cent, and that next year it was expected to be in the range of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent.
The improved figures prompted steep revisions to public sector borrowing, with the Treasury now expecting to repay £3.5bn of debt this year - a £6.5bn improvement on its previous estimate of £3bn borrowing.
The chancellor extended his US-influenced "workfare" package for the unemployed, the New Deal, which is be extended to all unemployed people and not just under-25s. It means claimants will face a cut in benefits if they refuse to take an offer of work or retraining.
There will be a review, under prominent barrister Lord Grabiner, of how to crack down on the "hidden" economy of those claiming unemployment benefit while working for cash. Mr Brown said one recommendation could be to force suspects to sign on for their benefit every day, rather than once a fortnight as at present.
Tories claimed that Mr Brown had conceded victory after their attacks on the climate change levy on business and the fuel escalator.
In the face of pressure from industry, Mr Brown has made steep cuts in the levy for certain businesses and sectors in return for voluntary action by industry to cut emissions.
Mr Brown also sweetened the package for business with a cut in employers' national insurance contributions, of 0.3 percentage points, and pledged that the package would be "revenue neutral" for business.
The Treasury also announced a move towards "hypothecation", or earmarking tax proceeds for specific spending purposes, which it is has long disliked. Mr Brown said proceeds from any significant future increases in road fuel duty would be ring-fenced for roads and public transport spending. And revenues from a 5 per cent real terms rise in tobacco duties would "go straight to additional investment in the National Health Service, worth £300m a year," he said.
The removal of the fuel escalator was responsible for the public finances not being as buoyant as some had expected. David Walton, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said the ending of the automatic increases had taken £6bn out of the government's tax receipts.
The government's fiscal projections now assume that fuel and tobacco increases will be in line with inflation, although Mr Brown hinted at a tax increase of 5 per cent on tobacco in next year's Budget. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Brown looks less green after easing environment taxes: Chancellor tells the Commons the government will honour its commitments but then scales back energy levy and fuel duty increases: [London edition]

Abstract: Gordon Brown told the Commons that the government would honour its environmental commitments, but his retreat on the energy tax and scaling back of fuel duty rises dismayed many in the green lobby. The energy tax, or climate change levy, will still be applied to large industrial users of gas and coal but Mr Brown said the total levy would be cut from £1.7bn to £1bn. The retreat, which followed intensive lobbying by industry, is accompanied by an 80 per cent discount to energy intensive sectors which sign efficiency agreements. Mr Brown said that he would reduce the proposed levy on major users of gas and coal to 0.15p per kilowatt hour from 0.21p and would encourage environment-friendly fuel by exempting renewable energy and combined heat and power from the proposed tax.

Full text: The chancellor's environmental credentials were questioned last night after he watered down two of the government's most contentious green taxes and signalled his desire to see high technology industry expand on open countryside.
Gordon Brown told the Commons that the government would honour its environmental commitments, but his retreat on the energy tax and scaling back of fuel duty rises dismayed many in the green lobby.
His promise to reform the planning system to allow the development of "high-tech clusters" is almost certain to lead to green- field expansion on the edge of many towns and cities.
The energy tax, or climate change levy, will still be applied to large industrial users of gas and coal but Mr Brown said the total levy would be cut from £1.7bn to £1bn. The retreat, which followed intensive lobbying by industry, is accompanied by an 80 per cent discount to energy intensive sectors which sign efficiency agreements.
Mr Brown said that he would reduce the proposed levy on major users of gas and coal to 0.15p per kilowatt hour from 0.21p and would encourage environment-friendly fuel by exempting renewable energy and combined heat and power from the proposed tax.
All the revenues from the tax would be recycled to business with every company enjoying a 0.3 per cent cut in employers' National Insurance Contributions - down from 0.5 per cent in the original proposal.
There would be a 100 per cent investment allowance to companies which moved from environmentally unfriendly industries to environmentally friendly ones with £150m, up from £50m originally, to support energy efficiency.
The vocal motoring lobby won its own success when Mr Brown announced the ending of the fuel duty escalator, currently set to increase fuel prices by an automatic 6 percentage points above inflation each year until 2002.
Duty rises would now be decided on an annual basis and will be set at a lower rate.
Revenue from any real increases in duty "will go straight to a ring-fenced fund for the modernisation of roads and public transport".
The announcement marked an extension of the role of hypothecation - ring-fencing revenues for a particular purpose - in public finances. The Treasury has resisted hypothecation in the past but yesterday's pre-Budget report extended its use to the fuel duty escalator and to tobacco duties which will be applied to the health budget.
Mr Brown said the reduction in the £28bn deficit Labour inherited and its success in meeting its environmental commitments meant the government could be more flexible with the green taxes.
Environmental groups expressed disappointment at what they saw as the chancellor's climb-down.
Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, said: "The chancellor's green promises look a little brown today."
But industry gave a cautious welcome to the proposed tax changes.
Adair Turner, CBI director general, said modifications to the climate change levy would "lessen the impact of the tax on competitiveness, without sacrificing the aim of improving the environment and increasing energy efficiency."
Ian Blakey, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said the rebate represented a climb-down by the chancellor, but it did not go far enough.
Industry also gave a muted response to the proposed changes in the fuel duty escalator, which has raised £18bn since it was introduced - at a rate of 5 per cent - by the Conservative government in 1993.
The Road Haulage Association said its members planned to continue with a traffic-disrupting protest over diesel fuel duties in Birmingham on November 20.
David Green, director general of the Freight Transport Association, representing 12,000 companies, said: "The chancellor has listened to our campaign that the escalator is hurting industry. We need to ensure that fuel duties do not rise above inflation at the next budget. We are not out of the woods yet."
Charles Rice, managing director of P&O Trans European, a distribution company, said: "The chancellor appears have acknowledged that his go-it-alone approach in the UK has added to costs without achieving any significant environmental gain."
The RAC Foundation described the move as "a step in the right direction" but warned "lower" fuel duty increases in future would mean increases of 2{1/2}-3 per cent and not 5{1/2} per cent. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Finance special: Pre-budget report: Environment taxes: Twin boost for green lobby and transport Ring-fencing fund for road improvements and redesign for climate change levy

Abstract: The chancellor yesterday boosted public transport and renewable energy with measures to `green" the tax system. The environment department, DETR, could win between pounds 1bn and pounds 1.8bn a year to put into a `ring-fenced fund" for improving public transport and modernising roads. This will be financed with revenue from any real- term rises in fuel duties. Gordon Brown bowed to intense pressure from road hauliers and agreed to scrap the automatic `fuel escalator" that increased duties 6% in real terms every year. This `hypothecation" of excise revenues is a victory for John Prescott, the deputy premier, in his campaign to ease road congestion and promote public transport.

Full text: The chancellor yesterday boosted public transport and renewable energy with measures to `green" the tax system.
The environment department, DETR, could win between pounds 1bn and pounds 1.8bn a year to put into a `ring-fenced fund" for improving public transport and modernising roads. This will be financed with revenue from any real- term rises in fuel duties.
Gordon Brown bowed to intense pressure from road hauliers and agreed to scrap the automatic `fuel escalator" that increased duties 6% in real terms every year. This `hypothecation" of excise revenues is a victory for John Prescott, the deputy premier, in his campaign to ease road congestion and promote public transport.
It amounts to pounds 200m for every 1p a gallon rise in fuel prices above the level of inflation and is the first time since the 1930s that a chancellor has `ring-fenced" road taxes for spending on transport.
The chancellor also redesigned the `climate change levy" to help Britain meet its Kyoto targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, cutting it from pounds 1.7bn to pounds 1bn. The move is designed to be fiscally neutral so the planned 0.5% cut in employers' national insurance contributions to offset the levy will be reduced to 0.3%.
Environmentalists hailed Mr Brown's decision to exempt renewable sources of energy and combined heat and power from the levy as a huge boost to green energy as a replacement for power-generating fuels, such as coal, in the drive to cut British CO2 emissions 20% by 2010.
The government needs to save an extra 5m tonnes of carbon to meet its binding Kyoto targets of a 12.5% reduction. The levy, according to Mr Brown, will save 2m tonnes, while the same amount will come from energy efficiency measures taken by intensive users. The chancellor has trebled the incentive for industry to invest in environmentally friendly energy by earmarking pounds 150m in capital allowances in the first year.
But Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, questioned whether the chancellor could meet his target for fur ther cuts in carbon emissions with such a sharp drop in the rate of the levy, from 0.21p per kilowatt hour to 0.15p.
Originally, the treasury had proposed a 50% discount for energy- intensive industries but has now increased this to 80%. Stephen Timms, treasury financial secretary, said the combination of 80% discount and capital incentives to invest had satisfied all 32 trade organisations. He was confident agreements for all heavy energy users to claim the discount would be reached before the spring budget.

Abstract: TRANSPORT Minister Sarah Boyack yesterday defended her slimmed- down roads programme and claimed a widespread schedule of improvements would have been unrealistic. But Miss Boyack was immediately criticised for failing to ensure that a higher proportion of the millions of pounds paid in road tax by motorists in Scotland was spent on transport. Miss Boyack said: 'These were tough choices but I am confident the approach we announced last week was the right one.' She claimed the Tory government had passed on to Labour an unrealistic 'wish list' of projects that would have cost 800million.

Full text:   TRANSPORT Minister Sarah Boyack yesterday defended her slimmed- down roads programme and claimed a widespread schedule of improvements would have been unrealistic.
But Miss Boyack was immediately criticised for failing to ensure that a higher proportion of the millions of pounds paid in road tax by motorists in Scotland was spent on transport.
Last week she announced the go-ahead for five road schemes but many more were dropped and responsibility for an extension of the M74 into Glasgow was transferred to the city council.
Miss Boyack said: 'These were tough choices but I am confident the approach we announced last week was the right one.' She claimed the Tory government had passed on to Labour an unrealistic 'wish list' of projects that would have cost 800million.
The M74 extension, costing 180million, was the most expensive scheme. She claimed there was a 'compelling case' for it in the context of the local transport strategy for Glasgow and South Lanarkshire.
This could mean the introduction of tolling on the new part of the road if it is ever built.
Scottish Tory transport spokesman Murray Tosh said motorists already paid enormous amounts to the Government and they deserved to have more money reinvested. He said: 'A rather bigger slice of what motorists cough up should go to roads than does at the moment.
Motorists pay road taxes and fuel taxes as well as all the other taxes non-drivers pay but they are not getting very much of that back'.
SNP shadow Transport Minister Kenny MacAskill agreed. He said: 'The motorist is paying through the nose and there's not any return in terms of road structure. If the Government thinks the roads network is important they should fund it better and directly. Whether it is insurance or petrol, motorists are paying a lot of money to the Treasury.' Although Miss Boyack ruled out tolls on existing trunk roads last week, local road charging and workplace parking levies could still go ahead at a future date to ease congestion but they would be charged by local authorities, not central government.
She told a conference in Glasgow yesterday that councils would have to be able to justify local road user and workplace levy schemes before they were allowed to set up the schemes.
The charges had to be 'transparent', should raise genuinely new money and should be fair to those who paid the charges and those who benefited from them.
On the eve of Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget statement, she defended the principle behind the fuel duty escalator, which pushes petrol prices up by 6 per cent more than the rate of inflation. She said Britain was legally bound to cut greenhouse gas emissions each year and motoring was a 'significant contributor' to climate change.

Abstract: In his pre-Budget statement, the Chancellor will disappoint the environmental lobby by scaling down the climate change levy after intense lobbying by Britain's bosses, who warned that it would harm productivity and cost jobs. Mr Brown will announce that he is raising the discount on the levy to more than 50 per cent for heavy users of energy. Under the changes, the pounds 238m bill facing the steel industry will be cut by more than half. But Mr Brown will seek to allay fears among Labour MPs that the Government is too influenced by big business by announcing pounds 4,000 start-up grants to help people in run-down parts of Britain set up their own businesses. The move reflects concern in the Government about the north-south jobs divide and growing fears that Britain is becoming "two nations".

Full text: GORDON BROWN will bow to pressure from big business today by announcing a climbdown over his plans to impose a "green" tax on industry.
In his pre-Budget statement, the Chancellor will disappoint the environmental lobby by scaling down the climate change levy after intense lobbying by Britain's bosses, who warned that it would harm productivity and cost jobs.
Mr Brown will announce that he is raising the discount on the levy to more than 50 per cent for heavy users of energy. Under the changes, the pounds 238m bill facing the steel industry will be cut by more than half.
But Mr Brown will seek to allay fears among Labour MPs that the Government is too influenced by big business by announcing pounds 4,000 start-up grants to help people in run-down parts of Britain set up their own businesses. The move reflects concern in the Government about the north-south jobs divide and growing fears that Britain is becoming "two nations".
The Chancellor, who will trail the measures for his next Budget in March, said yesterday that the theme of today's wide-ranging package would be "enterprise open to all". He will balance cuts in capital gains tax for investors by stressing he wants to create an "enterprise economy" on the most deprived estates as well as in more prosperous areas.
However, Mr Brown's boost for the poor will be coupled with a tough message for unemployed people. With one million job vacancies in Britain, Mr Brown will raise the prospect of tougher benefit penalties for jobless people who turn down offers of work or training.
The Chancellor, who came under fire from trades union leaders after announcing tax breaks for entrepreneurial executives last week, will emphasise that he wants all workers to hold shares in their firms. There will be further tax relief for firms which offer them.
Mr Brown is expected to confirm that pensioners will receive an increase of just 75p a week next April because state benefits are uprated in line with inflation, which is low. But Labour MPs hope the Chancellor will soften the blow by announcing measures to help the poorest of the elderly.
Leaders of the Confederation of British Industry will welcome Mr Brown's retreat over the climate change levy he announced a year ago. Its leaders have pressed for the discounts to be raised to 90 per cent. The Chancellor is expected to announce that he will exclude renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, from the climate change levy, which will be seen as a victory for environmental campaigners.
Despite the climbdown, John Prescott, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, will make it clear tomorrow that the Government is committed to tackling global warming. He will defend the Government's commitment to meeting its targets for reducing greenhouse gases in a hard-hitting speech to the "green" lobby.
The Government has insisted the climate change levy is aimed at reducing carbon emissions which lead to global warming, and will not raise extra revenue. Industry will be given money back from the Treasury through National Insurance contributions to ease the blow from the tax.
The Chancellor may also disappoint motorists hoping he will scrap the fuel escalator which has added six per cent a year in real terms to the cost of petrol - although it may be reviewed.

Abstract: Gordon Brown, the chancellor, is expected to announce in his pre-Budget report tomorrow that the proposed climate change levy will be modified to reduce its impact on business competitiveness. The Treasury has remained largely aloof from a furious lobbying campaign by industry, leaving negotiations on the tax largely to John Prescott's Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions. However, Mr Brown has come under increasing pressure from business leaders and Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, to respond to claims that the tax discriminates unfairly against manufacturing.

Full text: Gordon Brown, the chancellor, is expected to announce in his pre-Budget report tomorrow that the proposed climate change levy will be modified to reduce its impact on business competitiveness.
The Treasury has remained largely aloof from a furious lobbying campaign by industry, leaving negotiations on the tax largely to John Prescott's Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions.
However, Mr Brown has come under increasing pressure from business leaders and Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, to respond to claims that the tax discriminates unfairly against manufacturing.
This is because Mr Brown's plan to raise £1.75bn from the tax to fund a cut in employers' national insurance contributions would hand money gleaned from leanly-manned manufacturers to bigger service and public sector employers.
Industry claims the DETR is still in detailed negotiations with high energy use sectors on increasing the size of proposed discounts on the levy in return for binding undertakings to cut pollution emissions.
As a result, work on the proposals is believed to be continuing in the Treasury, and it is possible that final details of how the levy will work will be held back until the Budget in March.
However, officials say there is no doubt that the impact on the most exposed business sectors will be reduced. The most likely mechanism is higher discounts than the 50 per cent initially offered by the Treasury. Frantic lobbying is expected to continue almost until the chancellor rises in the Commons tomorrow.
Lisa Waters, economic adviser to the Energy Intensive Users' Group, said there would be "violent disagreement with the tax on Tuesday if different sectors get different rebates".
The National Farmers' Union said a levy would put farmers out of business, and the Food and Drink Federation said it would cost the food and drink industry £150m. The British Retail Consortium put the cost to retailers at £92m a year.
The Energy Intensive Users' Group claims that prior to any rebate, the aluminium industry will face a bill of £30m; steel manufacturers, £240m; chemical firms, £175m; paper manufacturers, £60m; the cement industry, £41m; and glass makers, £20m.
Others say that industry is exaggerating. Cambridge Econometrics estimates that the rebates on employer's NICs would lead to a net increase of 14,000 jobs in 2002, the levy's first full year.
Ecotec, an environmental research group, concluded that "industries employing 93 per cent of the UK workforce and earning 90 per cent of GDP will gain directly from the package or face a marginal increase in costs".
However, a recent report by Business Strategies suggests the tax could cost a net 156,000 jobs over 10 years - 95,000 in manufacturing and 60,000 in services - while output would fall by 1.5 per cent.
Mr Brown is also expected to review the controversial fuel escalator that ensures substantial price rises in the cost of petrol every year.
There has been strong opposition to the scheme from motorists and the freight transport industry. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Heat and power plants should be exempt from climate change levy: [London edition]

Full text: From Mr J.D. Wertheim.
Sir, As the UK's sole producer of soda ash, Brunner Mond very much welcomes the glimmer of hope on the climate change levy.
We strongly believe that, given the excellence of its environmental benefits and the energy efficiency of its operation, combined heat and power plants should be exempt from the levy. Our new CHP plant currently under construction will achieve thermal efficiency levels of 87 per cent, eliminate all SO{2} and particulate emissions from our old power plants, cut nitrous oxides emissions by two-thirds, and reduce our CO{2} emissions by 16.5 per cent while increasing electricity generation sixfold.
The investment in our CHP plant is £150m. The government's current proposals offer no credit for having already made such investments or for achieving such a high level of environmental performance. Our liability for the levy, at the full rate, would be £4m a year, and we would receive an offsetting reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions of £50,000 a year. This is not revenue neutral.
The government says that environmental taxes are to "reward the goods and punish the bads". This levy does exactly the opposite.

Abstract: Leading car manufacturers are threatening to stop buying British components unless government plans for a pounds 1.75bn energy tax are radically redesigned. Rover, Ford and Vauxhall say the tax will add to their costs, forcing them to buy components overseas, a move that would threaten thousands of British jobs. Representatives from the three car manufacturers expressed their opposition to the proposed tax on carbon emissions at a meeting with the treasury minister Stephen Timms last week.

Full text: Leading car manufacturers are threatening to stop buying British components unless government plans for a pounds 1.75bn energy tax are radically redesigned.
Rover, Ford and Vauxhall say the tax will add to their costs, forcing them to buy components overseas, a move that would threaten thousands of British jobs.
Representatives from the three car manufacturers expressed their opposition to the proposed tax on carbon emissions at a meeting with the treasury minister Stephen Timms last week.
They said a proposed cut in national insurance bills, intended to neutralise the tax, would not help them as they were not labour intensive. `He [Mr Timms] was keen to hear their concerns,' a treasury spokeswoman said.
The manufacturers are the latest industrial lobby to call for a rethink on the carbon tax, which was announced in the budget last March. Mr Brown is expected to modify his proposals in Tuesday's pre- budget report.
In doing so, however, the chancellor will have to be careful not to alienate the green lobby, which is urging him to stand firm against industry opposition to the tax.
In a paper published today, the environmental group WWF says: `We will be looking closely at the chancellor's statement on Tuesday to make sure he remains committed to key elements of the levy and does not cave in to industry scare-mongering.'
WWF says the climate change levy will benefit the environment and business by improving the economy's long-term competitiveness.
`Failure to make appropriate changes in the short run will raise the long-term economic and environmental costs.'

Abstract: IMAGINE that you're a trial lawyer. You've noticed that Americans are getting fatter, and that the government blames obesity and inactivity for more than 300,000 premature deaths every year. You've also noticed that scientists believe fatty foods kill people, and that fast-food outlets are selling cheeseburgers with both hands. You pilot your late-model Mercedes into the drive-through lane, risking grease stains on the leather upholstery. You make a purchase and discover that fast-food packaging is mute as to a more important risk. Nowhere does it say that eating a bucket of hot wings could result in serious injury or death. So you sue, hoping to win millions on behalf of heart patients -- as well as potential heart patients, who claim compensation for the worry that all those cheeseburgers may someday give them heart disease. Better yet, perhaps the states, unwilling to regulate cheeseburgers, will retain you to sue on behalf of the taxpayers, who have had to foot the public health bill for all the cheeseburgers they can't stop eating.

Far-fetched? Why? The same line of reasoning underlies the litigation that has succeeded so spectacularly against the tobacco companies; similar suits are pending against manufacturers of guns.
''The connection between cigarettes and guns,'' says Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University who founded the Tobacco Products Liability Project to spur lawsuits against the industry, ''is that both used political influence to escape safety regulation, and eventually people got tired of that and turned to the courts.''
He is right, and at first it is easy to applaud the plaintiffs' lawyers who brought the suits. But are guns and cigarettes really the same? For better or worse, Americans have the right to bear arms, the government already regulates guns, and it's at least debatable whether guns, unlike cigarettes, really do more harm than good. Besides, our experiences with outright prohibition of dangerous products like alcohol and drugs have been terrible.
The point is not the merits of gun control (which I advocate) or smoking (which I abhor). The point is, who decides? Despite the role of money in politics, government can regulate harmful products whenever there is the political will to do so. So it is puzzling to find governments as plaintiffs in product liability lawsuits. ''It's bizarre to go to court and ask for relief from the fact that you have the wrong laws,'' said Daniel Polsby, a law professor at George Mason University.
Consider global warming. When coastal cities find themselves building dikes to keep the waves at bay, why not sue Exxon and General Motors over their role in changing the world's climate? And why wait until the waters start rising? The science on global warming is already substantial, but having good science on your side is no prerequisite for suing, as the makers of silicone breast implants (and their unfortunate shareholders) well know.
By the lights of modern jurisprudence, it would make perfect sense for ''victims'' of fast food and climate change to sue, and the sooner the better: they might even succeed at deterring substantial harm. One claim against gun makers is that they failed to take the steps they should have to make sure that weapons aren't used improperly. But last year, 15,935 Americans died in alcohol-related car accidents, and the auto industry for years has known how to install devices that could make it more difficult for someone impaired by alcohol to start a car. Why isn't the plaintiff's bar assaulting Detroit on that point?
Perhaps it is just that they haven't gotten to it yet. At the moment, another target is in their sights: H.M.O.'s. The lawyers see themselves as protectors of innocent patients against profit-hungry corporations bent on rationing care. If the lawyers succeed (their first case is against Aetna), H.M.O.'s may indeed change the way they do business. But premiums will inevitably rise, forcing more Americans to join the 44 million who already lack health insurance.
THAT'S the trouble with letting lawyers and juries tackle social problems that elected officials can't seem to solve: when the buck is passed to the courts, the outcome may never suit anyone but the lawyers. Consider the Supreme Court's record. It upheld slavery until the Civil War made its decisions moot. It tried to paper over racial segregation with the ''separate but equal'' fiction, and when that failed, ordered public schools integrated, yet de facto school segregation persists. Roe v. Wade has hardly laid the abortion debate to rest.
It's hard to believe that lawyers, judges and juries can do any better with guns or global warming (or gluttony). But if the political system remains paralyzed by money and cynicism, it shouldn't be surprising if the courts try.

Economic SPADS could put Blair on the wrong track: [3 Edition]

Author: Green, Alf

Abstract: It comes at a deeply inconvenient time for politicians. Here in the UK, the Blair government is through its mid-point and looking increasingly towards its prospects of re-election. On Tuesday, Gordon Brown will deliver his latest pre-Budget report to MPs. No doubt the Iron Chancellor, awash with #12 billion of accumulated reserves and basking in the reflected glory of a growth performance this year which wrong-footed the entire City, looks like exceeding Treasury forecasts and has helped persuade the MPC that interest rates need to rise, will play the restrained miracle worker. BROWN will rise in the Commons with Tony Blair's confirmation of his Chancellor's profoundly ferrous qualities still ringing in his ears. There will be no irresponsible pre-election spending spree, the PM promised the CBI. We can count on Brown's resolute determination to stick to the existing spending targets of the Comprehensive Spending Review for that. Then there are the peripheral parts of Britain, like Labour- voting Scotland, where the economic cycle is most out of kilter with London and dearer money is the last thing we need. In the imprecise art of interest rate management, the MPC may think it is simply following the government's stated remit and choking off future inflationary pressures.

Full text:   balancingact
SINCE the fatal Paddington crash we have all become familiar with the rail industry acronym SPAD. Too many SPADs - signals passed at danger - compromise rail safety and can, as we've seen, kill innocent people.
Politicians and central bankers all agree there is no room for SPADs when it comes to managing an economy either. This isn't necessarily a matter of life and death. But to avoid the very real material ravages of boom and bust on people's lives, preventative action must be taken long before the economic signals start flashing red.
Preventing economic SPADs is, in principle, a much tougher proposition than making trains obey track signals. The brakes are not so demonstrably linked to the wheels. The warning signals can be much more obscure. And the time delays between driver reaction and any consequences being felt can be considerable.
In pre-millennial Britain, those now driving the macro-economy, the members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, have only one brake lever, interest rates, with which to pre-empt danger signals - principally inflationary pressures - which may only rear their ugly heads some 18 months to two years further down the tracks.
It can take that long for the impact of dearer or cheaper money today to feed through to company order books, personal consumption patterns and all the other variables that add up to whether an economy is performing in a sustainable or an unsustainable way.
And that impact can vary considerably, depending on which carriage of the UK economic train you happen to be occupying. Not so long ago the Bank of England governor Eddie George got into hot water for appearing to suggest the loss of northern manufacturing jobs might be a price worth paying to keep UK inflation under control.
Just last month, Greenwich NatWest produced some fresh analysis concluding that Northern Ireland, Scotland and the north east of England are indeed the three northern, peripheral parts of these islands least well correlated with the prevailing UK economic cycle and most likely to suffer damage as rates rise. Tentative support for all those tabloid headlines suggesting we Scots take the pain when the powers-that-be try to choke off yet another London property boom.
Putting the task like that, you begin to wonder why anyone would want to be a member of the MPC which last week pushed up UK interest rates by a quarter point for the second time in three months. The job looks like mission impossible. But mission impossible or not, the trend in global interest rates is now decisively upwards.
The MPC decision came as no real surprise. But the bigger half- point hike in euro-zone rates announced the same day by the European Central Bank was a lot less predictable and, potentially, much more damaging to already fragile confidence levels across the continent. With America's Federal Reserve poised to join the trend, possibly later this month, a monetary squeeze is clearly under way on both sides of the Atlantic.
It comes at a deeply inconvenient time for politicians. Here in the UK, the Blair government is through its mid-point and looking increasingly towards its prospects of re-election. On Tuesday, Gordon Brown will deliver his latest pre-Budget report to MPs. No doubt the Iron Chancellor, awash with #12 billion of accumulated reserves and basking in the reflected glory of a growth performance this year which wrong-footed the entire City, looks like exceeding Treasury forecasts and has helped persuade the MPC that interest rates need to rise, will play the restrained miracle worker.
BROWN will rise in the Commons with Tony Blair's confirmation of his Chancellor's profoundly ferrous qualities still ringing in his ears. There will be no irresponsible pre-election spending spree, the PM promised the CBI. We can count on Brown's resolute determination to stick to the existing spending targets of the Comprehensive Spending Review for that.
But the Chancellor has already set in train other fiscal changes whose full impact has yet to be felt in the critical period running up to the next election. If interest rates, including the cost of home loans, are now set on an inexorable upward path with as many as three or four more quarter point hikes next year being predicted by City economists, the overall impact on voter opinion as the next election looms could become extremely damaging to Labour's prospects.
Basic rate income tax is already due to be cut by 1p from next April. But at the same time, the married couples allowance and residual mortgage interest relief are being axed. The upper earnings limit on national insurance contributions will start to rise and the new children's tax credit will be "tapered away" from families paying higher rate tax. On top of that, there's the fuel duty escalator, due for another steep hike in April unless the government does a U-turn.
Many of Labour's new-found supporters in middle Britain may find themselves increasingly out of pocket as our redistributionist Chancellor moves resources towards poorer families, particularly poorer families with children.
And if, thanks to the MPC's efforts to quench inflationary pressures two years down the road, middle Britain has to pay more for its mortgages, its overdrafts and its plastic, the honeymoon with Blair, the longest-lasting honeymoon in post-war British politics, may finally be on the wane.
There's a battle looming too with British industry which has been conned into believing lower rates of corporation tax mean companies are actually handing less over to the Exchequer. Apart from higher borrowing costs and that same fuel price escalator, industry is bracing itself for a fight over the climate change levy, due to take #1750 million out of company profits from the year after next.
Then there are the peripheral parts of Britain, like Labour- voting Scotland, where the economic cycle is most out of kilter with London and dearer money is the last thing we need. In the imprecise art of interest rate management, the MPC may think it is simply following the government's stated remit and choking off future inflationary pressures.
But if opinion polls flash red next year, that's one SPAD that will surely force Gordon Brown and colleagues to rethink their entire strategy.

Full text:   THE CHANCELLOR Gordon Brown is expected to fudge the amount of money that the government anticipates raising from its controversial energy tax in his pre-budget statement on Tuesday.
Strident protests from industry have hampered civil servants' attempts to calculate how much the proposed energy tax might raise, especially since the criteria for exemptions have yet to be fixed.
By taxing carbon fuel, the government hopes it will encourage business to become more energy efficient. It maintains that the tax is necessary to ensure Britain meets international pledges to reduce CO2 emissions.
But companies that use large amounts of energy, notably in chemicals and heavy industries, have lobbied hard for a watering down of the proposals. They warn that the tax will mean massive increases in fuel bills, threatening both investment and jobs. Martin Gale, managing director of Irvine-based Caledonian Paper, warns that his company would suffer a #2 million hit if the climate change levy went ahead, which could lead to his factory's closure.
However, such claims have been derided as "scaremongering" by environmental lobby groups, which welcome Brown's proposed tax.
Earlier this year, Brown said that the so-called climate change levy would raise #1.75 billion, which he claimed would be redistributed to companies in the form of a 0.5% reduction in employers' national insurance contributions.
Companies are also hoping that Brown will on Tuesday announce the scrapping of the deeply unpopular "fuel price escalator". Originally introduced by the Conservatives, the measure means that tax on petrol and diesel rises by inflation plus 6% each year.
Industry is less confident that there will be a U-turn on the energy tax. Modest concessions have already been made by the Treasury, for example to exempt the chemical industry's more energy- hungry processes, but business fears that the government will plough on regardless of their criticisms.
Donald Adamson, tax partner at KPMG in Edinburgh, anticipates that the levy will be introduced from April 2001, with the rates applying to different types of fuel to be set in the forthcoming budget.
In his pre-budget statement, Gordon Brown will also flesh out proposals for tax credits on research and development conducted by small and medium-sized firms. Despite criticisms that they will do little to increase overall share ownership, he will also address the issue of all-employee share schemes, having earlier pledged to double the number of UK firms offering such schemes. Companies will be permitted to offer employees #3000-worth of "free" shares per annum, while for "10 key workers" in growing businesses the figure will be raised to #100,000.
But KPMG's Adamson warned that Brown might also instigate a "crackdown" on share schemes. There's a risk he will make it more difficult for companies to enjoy corporate tax deductions on gains made by employees that participate in qualifying share ownership trusts.

Abstract: THE GOVERNMENT'S "green" tax plans were criticised by its own experts as unfair and illogical yesterday. Worse, they do not do enough to protect the environment, the three members of the Academic Panel on Environmental Taxation said. If the Chancellor wants to continue with the 6 per cent escalating tax on petrol, he must spend the proceeds on public transport, the panel told Radio 4's Today programme, adding that plans for a climate- change levy will do disproportionate harm to small industries.

Full text: THE GOVERNMENT'S "green" tax plans were criticised by its own experts as unfair and illogical yesterday. Worse, they do not do enough to protect the environment, the three members of the Academic Panel on Environmental Taxation said.
The panel's comments will be discomforting for Gordon Brown as he polishes the pre-Budget statement he will make next week.
If the Chancellor wants to continue with the 6 per cent escalating tax on petrol, he must spend the proceeds on public transport, the panel told Radio 4's Today programme, adding that plans for a climate- change levy will do disproportionate harm to small industries.
"The Government is right to see environmental taxation as a good idea," said the panel's chairman, Dr Dieter Helm, an Oxford economist. "But it also sees environmental taxes as a way of raising money and the two motives get muddled up."
The panel is scathing about the proposed climate-change levy, a tax on electricity which will be used to reduce businesses' national insurance contributions. But the tax will raise the same amount from heavily polluting coal as from clean gas. Even wind and solar power will be taxed at the same rate.
Dr Helm said the levy was "extremely badly designed". "If the purpose of the levy is to do something about carbon emissions, you should tax carbon."
The Government should plough the proceeds of the tax into improving energy efficiency in business, not cutting national insurance, said his colleague, Professor David Pearce, of London University. "Most heavily polluting industries are gaining exemptions from the levy anyway - the only people who'll pay the tax will be little industries."
The third panel member, Professor David Newbery of Cambridge, condemned the fuel-price escalator. Motorists are already paying for more than the damage they cause the environment, he said: "On purely environmental terms, the escalator should have stopped last year."
The Chancellor could make a case for the escalator by promising to spend the proceeds on public transport, Professor Pearce said.
The Government should also raise the tax on energy used in people's homes, a Conservative policy that Labour promised to scrap if elected. "What they should have done was to continue with the tax to increase the price of fuel, then use it to insulate the homes of the poor," said Professor Newbery.

Abstract: Mainsteam insurance and pension funds are in for a roasting in the new year. Green pressure group Friends of the Earth intends to name and shame big financial groups which invest in companies that harm the environment. FoE policy director Tony Juniper says the first move will be the publication of a report in early January which will state whether big groups such as Legal & General, Norwich Union and the Prudential are green or red. He says: `We're going to expose the insurance sector and show up those companies which derive dividends from companies causing gross environmental damage. We'll name both the funds and their investments.'

Full text: Mainsteam insurance and pension funds are in for a roasting in the new year. Green pressure group Friends of the Earth intends to name and shame big financial groups which invest in companies that harm the environment.
FoE policy director Tony Juniper says the first move will be the publication of a report in early January which will state whether big groups such as Legal & General, Norwich Union and the Prudential are green or red.
He says: `We're going to expose the insurance sector and show up those companies which derive dividends from companies causing gross environmental damage. We'll name both the funds and their investments.'
Juniper believes that almost anyone with any money has some invested through pension or insurance policies with mainstream investment companies.
He adds: `Nearly all investors in their plans are concerned about green issues and support moves towards environmental best practice. We aim to mobilise them in a way that major fund management companies will not be at all comfortable with.'
But it won't all be the stick. FoE also intends proffering the carrot of self interest. It will tell financial companies that unless they use their shareholder voting power for green issues, they will suffer as much as any individual from climate change and environmental disaster.
Global warming will hit insurance company profits, for instance, because they will have to pay out more often for floods and other disasters.
But Juniper and FoE do not stop their probing at mainstream funds. In common with a growing number in the ethical and green investment market, they are questioning the role of specialist green and ethical funds and their future direction.
Ethical and environmental investing has come a long way since Friends Provident launched the first Stewardship fund a decade and a half ago. There are now some 30 funds with total assets approaching pounds 1.7bn - or around pounds 30 for every UK citizen. And that's before counting privately managed ethical funds for small pension plans and wealthy individuals.
But unlike most other investment areas, savers have to make two decisions before deciding to entrust their cash to a unit or investment trust. Besides working out whether a fund has competent managers - or whether a child with a pin could do better -they must also resolve just how deep their green streak runs or how ethical they want the fund to be. For there are huge variations between the ethics of the funds.
John Fleetwood of specialist IFA Ethical Investment Services, which is based in Preston, says that while many fund managers claim to adopt positive criteria to balance or outweigh negative factors such as animal test ing, pornography, military equipment production, tobacco and environmental issues, `in many instances, the evidence is far from compelling. It is relatively easy for a large company to implement a good equal opportunities policy and to donate a numerically large amount to charity. But it could remain to all intents and purposes, a very standard company'.
Sometimes, funds both condemn a company with one hand, and buy its shares with the other. The Murray Johnstone Ethical World Fund, a pounds 6m trust launched in May, has an `alert' on IBM because of military contracts, on Microsoft due to its far east operations and banks in general for indiscriminate lending.
But among the fund's top 10 holdings are Microsoft, IBM and NatWest.
This can lead to investor confusion, but it also allows the fund's managers to put pressure on company managers, rather than adopting the more usual stance of selling out and having no say through investor pressure.
Later this month, Jupiter is launching an Environmental Opportunities Fund. Instead of rejecting `sin' companies outright, it will adopt a `best of sector' approach which invests in any company that has a record of being the best for green and socially responsible performance in its class.
The fund could end up in investments which would be shunned by others. But fans of this approach argue that backing the best even in a less than savoury sector sends a message to the others - and gives green investment a toehold in the boardroom.

Brown's grey areas on tax: [1 Edition]

Abstract: But who's right? William Hague told the CBI this week that the big conflicts of the next century will be economic, not territorial, and that the victors' main weapons will be low tax rates, not guns and bombs. Is the present Chancellor an instinctive tax-cutter? Is Britain, under New Labour, well on its way to becoming one of those low-tax combatants in the economic wars of the 21st century? As the OECD row broke, a Treasury spokesman told the Press Association: "The tax burden is not rising. The tax burden is falling. The Budget Red Book shows the tax burden as 37.2% in 1998/99 and 36.6% in the coming year." There is one factual mistake and a barrow-load of spin in that answer. Turn to page 159 of the current Red Book, where the tax take is charted as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), and you will find that figure of 37.2% is the forecast for this year (1999/00) and not the outturn in 1998/99. There is, indeed, a fall to 36.6% predicted for next year (2000/01) but the commentary suggests it will be due to the phasing out of the windfall tax on the utilities and lower corporation tax receipts as a result of economic slowdown rather than any proactive tax-cutting mission by the Chancellor.

Full text: 'TOTALLY untrue," was the Chancellor's curt response yesterday to a new report suggesting Britain's tax burden rose faster than other European countries' in year one of New Labour.
The survey, by the respected Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, was seized on gleefully by those sections of the London press desperately seeking reasons to back William Hague. It was seized on even more gleefully by Mr Hague's party, hungry for fresh indictments on its "taxation by stealth" charge sheet against the government.
But who's right? William Hague told the CBI this week that the big conflicts of the next century will be economic, not territorial, and that the victors' main weapons will be low tax rates, not guns and bombs. Is the present Chancellor an instinctive tax-cutter? Is Britain, under New Labour, well on its way to becoming one of those low-tax combatants in the economic wars of the 21st century?
If Gordon Brown really is accusing the OECD of lying and the Opposition, in turn, is accusing the Chancellor of being economical with the actualite about his fiscal record, those of us who prefer facts and evidence to political bluster and spin need some robust answers to questions like these.
As the OECD row broke, a Treasury spokesman told the Press Association: "The tax burden is not rising. The tax burden is falling. The Budget Red Book shows the tax burden as 37.2% in 1998/99 and 36.6% in the coming year." There is one factual mistake and a barrow-load of spin in that answer.
Turn to page 159 of the current Red Book, where the tax take is charted as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), and you will find that figure of 37.2% is the forecast for this year (1999/00) and not the outturn in 1998/99. There is, indeed, a fall to 36.6% predicted for next year (2000/01) but the commentary suggests it will be due to the phasing out of the windfall tax on the utilities and lower corporation tax receipts as a result of economic slowdown rather than any proactive tax-cutting mission by the Chancellor.
And the projected fall is for one year only. Overall the trend is up. The picture of Britain and tax over the past 20 years is one of the tax take rising sharply as a percentage of GDP - remember Geoffrey Howe doubled VAT in the first Thatcher Budget - to a peak of 39% in 1982. From 1984 onwards, the total tax take fell steadily, bottoming out in 1994 at 33%. Apart from next year's projected fall, it has been rising ever since.
We should not be surprised. In his first three Budgets Gordon Brown may have cut headline rates of income and corporation tax. But the present Chancellor has proved himself very adept at clawing a lot more back by shrinking allowances and taking his secateurs to those parts of the fiscal undergrowth that few people, outside Whitehall and the accountancy profession, ever penetrate.
In his first Budget, in July 1997, Gordon Brown added around #6000m a year to total taxes. In his second Budget, in March 1998, he added a further #1210m by year three. Only last March, in his third Budget, did the Chancellor end his speech taking less in tax from the nation than before he stood up. And in that case the bulk of the largesse, #3555m of tax cuts, doesn't come into effect until the tax year starting in April 2001.
In the current financial year (1999/00) the overall effect of those three Brown Budgets is to push the tax take up by #5030m. So the comparative OECD survey comes as no surprise. The only real surprise is that the Chancellor, despite the clear evidence of his own Treasury's Red Books, wants to maintain the fiction that he is, first and foremost, a tax cutter.
Perhaps that's because he dare not give public credence to the other thing he is quite clearly about. The dreaded R word. Redistribution.
If you want to explore Gordon Brown's overall tax strategy to date, free of spin and counter-spin, there are tables in each of the first three Brown Red Books which cost each and every budget measure he's announced so far in terms of "Exchequer yield", a euphemism for tax take. These six pages of A4 will tell you more about this chancellor's fiscal strategy than acres of claim and counter-claim.
For industry, the story is one of carrot and stick. Apart from the windfall tax on the privatised utilities which has been used to try to get the young unemployed back into work, the headline-grabbing cuts in corporation tax (down 3p in the pound since Labour came to power) have largely been paid for by abolishing advance corporation tax and making companies pay their tax bills quarterly. Reducing employers' national insurance contributions from 2001 (cost #1700m) will be paid for by the proposed climate change levy (raising #1750m). And then there's the annual fuel price escalator.
For a chancellor who likes to be seen as pro-enterprise - he was detailing more tax breaks for small company entrepreneurs only this week - the overall picture is remarkably neutral. The big surprise is that so many businesses have swallowed the spin and moan only about red tape, not the tax burden.
It's only when you get down to taxes on individuals that the full redistributionist force of the three Brown budgets becomes clear. There are plenty of hits on property-owning, car-driving middle Britain, from hikes on stamp duty and that same fuel price escalator to the abolition of both the married couple's allowance and mortgage interest relief, and increases in the upper earnings limit on national insurance from next April.
There are carrots here, too - improved child benefit, the new 10p starting rate of income tax, and the cut in the basic rate to 22p next April. But most of the proceeds of the tax grab on individuals has been redirected at helping poorer families, particularly poorer families with children. The working families tax credit and the abolition of the entry rate for National Insurance contributions will cost a combined #2700m next year.
But, for Gordon Brown and this Labour Government, redistributionist thinking seems to go off the rails when it comes to the elderly. I'm not just thinking of the pathetic 73p a week rise planned, thanks to current low inflation levels, for the state pension. Or the even more miserable 25p rise that currently goes to the over-eighties.
I'm thinking back to Gordon Brown's biggest single budget raid of all on the nation's company pension schemes. According to his first Red Book, the chancellor is raising a staggering #5400m this year from his 1997 decision to abolish tax credits paid to pension schemes and UK companies.
Combined with the stricter funding requirements introduced by the 1995 Pensions Act, that one decision has put a lot of final salary pension schemes in some difficulty. Combined with tougher accounting rules for companies with pension schemes currently being floated by the Accounting Standards Board, these changes could push more companies into reconsidering whether they want to be in the business of providing pensions at all.
It may have seemed a great wheeze at the time to Brown's youthful team of advisers. But if you add in the impact of the current endowment mortgage scandal, which may leave hundreds of thousands of ageing British citizens with outstanding bills for their homes when their mortgage payments stop, the redistributionist and not-so-tax- cutting Mr Brown may find his Government has a grey Britain crisis on its hands before too long.

Abstract: Some prominent Europeans have complained to us recently about what they see as the "isolationist" attitudes of the Republicans who control the U.S. Senate. We don't buy that characterization for a minute.

Full text: Some prominent Europeans have complained to us recently about what they see as the "isolationist" attitudes of the Republicans who control the U.S. Senate. We don't buy that characterization for a minute. Major U.S. free trade initiatives of the last six years, for example, have had more backing from Republicans in the Congress than from Democrats and would not have been approved otherwise.
That doesn't address objections that the Republican Senate has been hostile to a recent string of proposed United Nations treaties. But even there, we venture an alternative hypothesis -- that the checks and balances enshrined in the U.S. Constitution are currently saving the rest of the world from its own worst impulses.
The U.S. Senate has no official veto, of course, over what other countries want to do. But everybody knows major international initiatives like the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the treaty establishing a permanent international criminal tribunal, and the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, are pretty much dead letters without American participation.
These thoughts are spurred by the seeming irrelevance of the U.N. meeting on climate change currently taking place in Bonn. In terms of the number of countries and delegates participating, and in terms of the scope of the conference's ambition -- drastic reductions in global energy use -- it's just as big an event as the Rio and Kyoto conferences that preceded it. But it hasn't received even a tenth of the media attention. And we suspect that has something to do with the fact that its recommendations have barely a snowball's chance in a greenhouse hell of ever being implemented.
Not so long ago, of course, global warming was the crise celebre. Everybody who knew anything knew that drastic action was needed to curb climate change. U.S. Vice President Al Gore even once wrote grandly when he was a senator, "We must make the rescue of the environment the central organizing principle for civilization." Wow!
But then serious scientists swung into action and began to examine some of the U.N. claims. The most sensitive measuring systems couldn't detect any warming of the earth's atmosphere in the second half of this century. The computer models used to predict future warming were ridiculously simplistic. And the costs of stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, if it could be done at all, were, if you'll forgive us, stratospheric.
Sensible Americans started to realize that the best insurance policy is keeping the world rich enough in economic terms to adapt to any changes they might encounter in the future. Even if Mr. Gore manages to be elected president next year, and the Democrats capture the Senate, America is not likely to support a global economic suicide pact.
There are some who claim carbon dioxide targets can be painlessly achieved by using energy more "efficiently." But that scenario rests on the dubious premise that greedy capitalists who will do everything else to make a buck are carelessly wasting money on energy use.
So here's our prediction for the future of the Kyoto debate. The global climate change industry -- activists, ministers and bureaucrats -- will go on as usual, jetting around the world to conferences lamenting the fact that politicians are too short-sighted to do anything "for the children." But even European governments, for whom "austerity" means redistributing only 50% of the national wealth, will realize that the costs of "doing something" are prohibitive. Naturally, of course, they'll publicly blame the U.S. for their inaction. But privately, we suspect, there will be a few sighs of relief in European capitals. Saved again from another dumb treaty.

Climate hots up for government: ENVIRONMENT VIEWPOINT PAUL EKINS: How committed is the UK to countering global warming? Ministers must soon make up their minds how they're going to achieve their targets: [London edition]

Abstract: Its consultation paper on the subject a year ago accepted climate change as "one of the greatest environmental threats facing the world today".

Business has waged an unremitting campaign against the measure over the past six months. On the face of it this is curious, for the government is proposing to return to business, through cuts in employers' National Insurance contributions or incentives for improved energy efficiency, all the revenues raised from the levy. "Significant losers" - the sectors whose net cost is more than 0.1 per cent of turnover - employ only 7 per cent of the workforce and generate 10 per cent of the UK's value-added.

Full text: A moment of truth is approaching for the government as it draws together the threads of its strategy for addressing climate change.
Its consultation paper on the subject a year ago accepted climate change as "one of the greatest environmental threats facing the world today". Since then, a shower of further consultation papers has followed: on the proposed climate change levy, announced at the time of the last Budget in March, on renewable energy, in the same month, and on the new home energy efficiency scheme, in May. The consultation periods are drawing to a close. The government must soon make up its mind.
The first indication of its thinking will be revealed next Tuesday when it responds, in its pre-Budget report, to feedback on the proposed levy. Business has waged an unremitting campaign against the measure over the past six months. On the face of it this is curious, for the government is proposing to return to business, through cuts in employers' National Insurance contributions or incentives for improved energy efficiency, all the revenues raised from the levy.
The laws of mathematics dictate that winnings from the levy must exactly balance the losses. However, a detailed sectoral study by Ecotec*, the Birmingham-based environment consultancy, using data from the Office for National Statistics, shows some sectors would be winners and others losers.
In total, sectors employing 67 per cent of the UK workforce, and generating 68 per cent of the economy's value-added, would show a net benefit from the levy.
"Significant losers" - the sectors whose net cost is more than 0.1 per cent of turnover - employ only 7 per cent of the workforce and generate 10 per cent of the UK's value-added.
These figures suggest the shift of taxation that the levy would bring about could substantially benefit the economy as a whole.
The levy will perform an important function in signalling to business that, whatever the vagaries of power at the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, energy prices are set on an upward trend, which should encourage companies to look more seriously for cost-effective energy-efficiency measures than many do at present. By itself, however, it will fall far short of reducing carbon emissions by the required amount to meet the government's target of a 20 per cent cut from 1990's level by 2010.
A study by Cambridge Econometrics and Forum for the Future**, published today, explores where such carbon savings might come from, and the economic implications of achieving them.
The first conclusion is that the government will not come near its target without substantial new policy measures directed towards all carbon-emitting sectors, namely industry, transport and households. The lead times before such measures become effective mean that they need to be implemented soon if they are to deliver their possible carbon savings by 2010. Government action must closely follow the end of consultation if the target is not to slide out of reach.
The second conclusion from the study is that, given the requisite new policies, the 20 per cent target is eminently attainable. The "20 per cent reduction" policy package in the study includes the generation of 15 per cent of the UK's electricity needs from renewables, and the increase of combined heat and power capacity to 10GWe (gigawatts equivalent) by 2010; a government investment of £3.5bn in domestic energy efficiency over the next 10 years; and taxes on fossil-fuel use by business and in transport.
Carbon reduction is not the only benefit of this policy package. Sulphur emissions are reduced by 12.5 per cent, ensuring that the UK's sulphur commitments for 2010 are satisfactorily met.
The investment in renewable energy should ensure that the UK acquires a vigorous industrial capability in what is widely forecast to be among the fastest growing sectors in the next century. And the improvement in domestic energy efficiency substantially reduces fuel poverty, and would save many of the 30,000 lives that are lost each year because poor people cannot afford to keep warm.
It would be surprising if these benefits came completely free, and they do not. Economic growth would slow from an average 2.56 per cent per year to 2.54 per cent per year between 2000 and 2010. Gross domestic product in 2010 would be 0.28 per cent below what it would have been without the carbon-reduction measures. Put another way, with these policies the economy reaches in mid-February 2011 the same size which, without them, it would have attained at the end of 2010.
Is a six-week delay in economic gratification of this kind justified by the UK's achieving global leadership in addressing the world's worst environmental threat, reducing cross-border acid rain, stopping thousands of people dying of hypothermia and kick-starting a new industry with global potential?
If the UK government thinks not, then its rhetoric of support for sustainable development, published in the sustainable development strategy in May this year, will be revealed as a complete sham. The vigour with which it pursues its target for a 20 per cent reduction in carbon emissions will act as a litmus test of its sustainable development commitment overall. The results of the test will soon be available. * Who Gains from the Climate Change Levy?, Ecotec, Birmingham ** The 20 per cent Solution: Meeting the Government's Targets on Climate Change, Forum for the Future, London

Full text: From Mr Martin Temple.
Sir, There is a glaring omission in your article "Energy levy plans fuel big consumers' anger" (October 28). The climate change levy, as proposed by the government, will impact on all manufacturing and engineering companies irrespective of size.
Groups representing energy-intensive users have put forward strong arguments since their companies will attract the largest levy. Small and medium-sized companies and those using less energy which are outside the Integrated Pollution Prevention Control regime and not subject to negotiated agreements, will also be heavily penalised.
This is best illustrated if you look at a typical example of an engineering company employing about 300 people with an annual energy bill of £750,000 ($1.24m). Under the government's proposals, that company would incur a levy in the region of £110,000, offset by only £19,000 in National Insurance contribution rebate. Affected by up to £90,000, it will be less able to invest in energy-efficient technologies.
The EEF fully endorses the government's commitment to meet its Kyoto targets. There are, however, alternative ways of devising a levy. Extending the opportunity for negotiated agreements will allow more companies to invest in energy efficiency improvements. Capital allowances or levy credits will direct the levy back to those companies which embark on relevant capital expenditure. By achieving near fiscal neutrality, they would be better able to maintain their international competitiveness.

Full text: Risk from having no 'green' nous
John Gummer, the former Conservative cabinet minister, also popped up at the CBI conference to warn that there was another side to the debate over the proposed climate change levy. Businesses are up in arms about the levy, especially heavy consumers of electricity or gas. But Gummer, at the heart of government for years, says many companies face real problems because they lack environmental awareness. Financial services companies, in particular, are taking big risks by not giving higher priority to the environmental policies of clients and investments, says Gummer. "There are several firms I wouldn't invest in because I know there are some very nasty things around the corner," he says. "One of the important things to change these attitudes is for the insurance, banking and financial institutions to realise it's they that will suffer and . . . it's their customers and stakeholders that will be hit if they don't take on things as big as climate change."
* Today will see the government under renewed pressure in the Commons over its plans to crack down on alleged tax avoidance by consultants, especially in computing. The Treasury has amended the so-called IR35 rules designed to prevent employees avoiding National Insurance by setting themselves up as companies. But Vincent Cable, the Liberal Democrat's industry spokesman, says the change will only lift the threat to "fat cats" such as partners in big City firms. "Computer contractors will still be clobbered very hard and it threatens to have a serious impact on the IT sector." Mr Cable points to the "jarring contrast" with Gordon Brown's announcement this week of tax breaks on options for entrepreneurs. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Comment & Analysis: Analysis:The big clean-up Today the CBI will discuss the introduction of the energy levy on businesses. The horse-trading on discounts will soon follow

Abstract: British business is in a tizz about the tax on its use of energy which Gordon Brown plans to introduce in the next budget. Delegates at the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry, gathering in Birmingham this morning, are worried as usual about interest rates and the pound. But nothing is exercising them more or has challenged the government's business-friendly credentials as much as the climate change levy. This new tax will not swell the government's coffers nor will it go far to meeting the UK's target for reducing the carbon dioxide emissions believed to cause global warming. From industry's point of view, most companies will be winners, because the tax will be offset by lower national insurance charges. For most who lose, the pain will be minimal, especially if it stimulates them to save energy. The likely starting tax rate of 0.6p per kilowatt hour is less than a 10th of what energy costs, and for most companies they form only a small part of their total bills. It was originally announced in this year's budget, to be introduced in 2001. The near pounds 2bn to be raised is to be `recycled' in the form of lower national insurance charges for all employers. Business opposition was also supposed to be defused by the way the treasury was following a report by Lord Marshall - the British Airways chairman and past president of the CBI. Also, the government's advisory committee on business and the environment (ACBE), packed with executives from Shell, BP, Amoco and BT, had said in March last year that tax could have a role to play in reducing energy use.

Full text: British business is in a tizz about the tax on its use of energy which Gordon Brown plans to introduce in the next budget. Delegates at the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry, gathering in Birmingham this morning, are worried as usual about interest rates and the pound. But nothing is exercising them more or has challenged the government's business-friendly credentials as much as the climate change levy.
This new tax will not swell the government's coffers nor will it go far to meeting the UK's target for reducing the carbon dioxide emissions believed to cause global warming. From industry's point of view, most companies will be winners, because the tax will be offset by lower national insurance charges. For most who lose, the pain will be minimal, especially if it stimulates them to save energy. The likely starting tax rate of 0.6p per kilowatt hour is less than a 10th of what energy costs, and for most companies they form only a small part of their total bills.
But businesses hate taxes, no matter how small, partly because they fear the rate of tax may be increased, once the principle has been established. They also point out that the carbon dioxide savings from the levy cannot be guaranteed. Their preferred alternative is legally binding targets on energy use and emissions, backed up by a system to trade permits so that the reductions are achieved at lowest cost.
For the government, the levy is a first move towards taxing `bads', such as pollution, instead of employment. It is a clear statement that all businesses must strive to save energy and so reduce the country's carbon output.
It was originally announced in this year's budget, to be introduced in 2001. The near pounds 2bn to be raised is to be `recycled' in the form of lower national insurance charges for all employers. Business opposition was also supposed to be defused by the way the treasury was following a report by Lord Marshall - the British Airways chairman and past president of the CBI. Also, the government's advisory committee on business and the environment (ACBE), packed with executives from Shell, BP, Amoco and BT, had said in March last year that tax could have a role to play in reducing energy use.
Industry was not placated, however. The recycling promise caused trouble because it has been widely misinterpreted to mean that no individual company, or no industry sector, would be worse off. This idea was always a nonsense. Mr Brown flagged his new measure as a way of shifting taxation from employment to resource use. The inevitable consequence was that industries such as steel, paper and chemical manufacture would lose out, while the service sector would benefit.
Industry has scored some points, however. Most significant has been the accusation that this really is not an environmental measure at all, just the treasury up to its old tricks of meddling in the economy.
To start with, the scale of carbon dioxide savings is trivial, certainly compared with what industry, especially chemicals, has already achieved by way of energy savings. Political considerations have played their part. No discrimination is being made between power generated from nuclear energy or coal, despite their different impacts on climate change. Renewable power from the wind and sun are subject to the levy as well, even though these are the very energy sources which industry should be encouraged to take up.
Industry has also complained, not unreasonably, that it is the sole target of the tax, despite the huge potential for saving in domestic energy consumption. But the government has been determined to avoid its predecessor's fate when Kenneth Clarke tried to push up VAT on domestic energy.
Industry also points out that if the government really wants companies to save energy it should use much more than the planned pounds 50m-a-year to support energy- saving investments, instead of using most of the pounds 1.75bn to cut national insurance. Will it even boost jobs? The chemicals industry, for example, claims more than 5,000 jobs are at risk and one economic analysis suggests employment throughout the economy will fall over a 10-year period because of the levy. (On the other side, envi ronmentalists have produced equally meticulous analyses showing there will be a significant overall boost to jobs.)
Different assumptions produce different results but it is clear that the majority of businesses will gain and most of those which will lose will suffer a pretty insignificant extra cost even if they do not manage to reduce their energy consumption. Even the chemical industry claims that its 170 companies, with sales of more than pounds 30bn, will have to pay only an extra pounds 50m in total - less than 0.2% of sales.
Ecotec, for the Worldwide Fund for Nature, concluded that the tax will be neutral or positive for companies employing more than 90% of the country's workforce. And it suggested that the sectors which will suffer will incur very limited extra costs - food manufacturing was identified as one of the biggest losers but the cost would be only 0.15% of the sector's sales.
Lord Marshall had suggested that heavy users of energy be given a discount on the levy. A figure of 50% was suggested, but the CBI has argued that in these special circumstance the discount should be as much as 95%. Such a huge discount, effectively exempting them from the tax, seems out of the question. But Mr Brown is likely to make some concessions, possibly increasing the discount to 75% and widening the range of companies which can claim it.
He will also probably bow to environmental pressure to exempt renewable energy sources, and give government support to the trading of emissions permits, the tool favoured by big business for meeting the climate change target. The levy will stay, however, to the chagrin of the CBI.
Roger Cowe writes on business and the environment
Behind the levy
Under the Kyoto agreement of 1997, the UK's emissions have to be cut to 189m tonnes by 2010, a reduction of 12.5%
Labour's 1997 manifesto upped this promise to 20%
Changes in energy use look likely to have cut emissions to the Kyoto level by 2000 but are forecast to rise to about 194m tonnes of carbon by 2010
The levy should reduce emissions by 1.5m tonnes by 2010

Abstract: Trick or treat! Sorry, no treat -- just tricks, about $47- billion worth. Remember the Speech from the Throne, with Adrienne Clarkson dressed up as Snow White promising to keep us all wrapped up and warm through the next session of Parliament? Well, that wasn't Snow White. That was the wicked Chretien cabinet, and that speech was a coded blueprint for a $32-billion spending extravaganza. Even the most optimistic forecasters who have looked at the Liberals' 50-50 plan say the tax-cut potential is hopelessly inadequate. Royal Bank economist John McCallum, in a recent study, said that Liberal formula would at best produce a "trivial" reduction in personal income taxes and minor fiddles with employment- insurance premiums and business taxes. At most, Canadians might see only a 5% cut in their income taxes by 2004.

Full text: Trick or treat! Sorry, no treat -- just tricks, about $47- billion worth. Remember the Speech from the Throne, with Adrienne Clarkson dressed up as Snow White promising to keep us all wrapped up and warm through the next session of Parliament? Well, that wasn't Snow White. That was the wicked Chretien cabinet, and that speech was a coded blueprint for a $32-billion spending extravaganza.
And remember all the talk recently about a fat fiscal dividend coming out of the big surpluses Ottawa was building? Well, don't waste time figuring out how Ottawa could spend the money. It's going, going, gone. According to the numbers in the Finance Department's Halloween bag of "spending pressures" seeping out of cabinet, the government is already on the brink of allocating most of the spending portion of the surplus for the next five years.
Forget, too, about significant income tax cuts. Under these unplugged programs, federal spending stays high for the next five years and opportunities for tax reduction are sharply reduced. If the economy gets into any kind of trouble, tax cut options could dry up altogether.
In addition to the $32-billion packed into the Throne Speech, there's another $15-billion in fresh money set to dribble away into dozens of classic Liberal sops to the nation's whiners.
They include $250-million for feature film support, $250-million for sound recordings, $750-million for housing and more than $1- billion for another experimental employment-insurance drain.
Most of the spending binge is unnecessary. You have to really work as a government to concoct these plans to spend money. We don't need $1.5-billion to develop a climate change strategy, $500- million for weather services, $1-billion for "lifelong learning" initiatives, or millions more for such economic losers as Atomic Energy of Canada.
None of these numbers appear to be nailed down, but they have a pretty solid feel to them. And the $47-billion total, give or take a couple of billion, makes it clear that the Chretien government is going to stick to its famous plan: spend first, cut taxes if we have to later if there's any money left. At this rate, there might not be.
Over the next five years, according to most forecasts, Ottawa's surpluses could add up to about $90-billion, assuming the economy grows at a steady 4.5% clip and nothing happens to drive interest rates crazy or revenues suddenly down. The Chretien government's mantra has been that it will spend 50% of the projected surpluses and use the other 50% to either cut taxes or pay down some debt.
Even the most optimistic forecasters who have looked at the Liberals' 50-50 plan say the tax-cut potential is hopelessly inadequate. Royal Bank economist John McCallum, in a recent study, said that Liberal formula would at best produce a "trivial" reduction in personal income taxes and minor fiddles with employment- insurance premiums and business taxes. At most, Canadians might see only a 5% cut in their income taxes by 2004.
If the leaked ministerial priorities emerge as the Liberal plan, the chances of even that small cut in taxes are sharply reduced. With half the surplus spent from the start, there's no real cushion to make sure that tax cuts can be delivered. Any surprises -- interest rate shocks, slowdowns, revenue disruptions -- would eat into the tax cut or debt-reduction option.
When Paul Martin delivers his fiscal update next Tuesday, we won't see any of these long-term spending priorities. Even his budgets stick to the short term, keeping us all in the dark lest we actually figure out what's going on. Behind the scenes, however, it's clear that new spending is at the top of the government's agenda. How many cabinet ministers have submitted their tax- reduction priorities? Maybe that list will be in the next leak.
John McCallum, Royal Bank economist, said the Liberals' 50-50 plan would at best produce a "trivial" reduction in personal income taxes.

Full text: NEWS IN BRIEF
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia - President Slobodan Milosevic may face more criminal charges, including genocide, in connection with the bloody crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the chief prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunal said Thursday.
Carla del Ponte told reporters that the tribunal, based in The Hague, Netherlands was considering additional charges that included "offenses committed in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as offenses committed in Kosovo during 1998, including the charge of genocide."
Tribunal investigators have been in Kosovo gathering evidence for the cases since June 12, when NATO sent in peacekeepers after a 78- day bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
House panel backs cancer treatment
WASHINGTON - Women now eligible for free mammograms and Pap smears also could get help paying for cancer treatment under legislation approved by a House committee Thursday.
"Early detection is wonderful, but it has to be accompanied by medical treatment," said Rep. Karen McCarthy (D-Mo.), a supporter of the bill.
Nearly 800,000 women nationwide have received free mammograms to screen for breast cancer and free Pap smears to screen for cervical cancer under a program created by Congress in 1990 to help those who lack private health insurance.
But thousands who have discovered that they have cancer lack insurance to help pay for treatment. The cancer treatment would cost the federal government $315 million over five years.
Third Arab nation forms ties to Israel
WASHINGTON - Over Arab and Palestinian objections, Mauritania made history Thursday by establishing full diplomatic relations with Israel in a show of support for peacemaking in the Middle East.
"It is a sovereign decision, taken by us as a sovereign state," Mauritania's foreign minister, Ahmed Ould sid Ahmed, said after exchanging documents with David Levy, the Israeli foreign minister, at a State Department ceremony. "We hope that this decision will foster efforts to arrive at a solution."
The northwest African nation is only the third Arab country to have full relations with Israel. The two others are Egypt and Jordan.
Witness confesses, halts execution
COLUMBIA, S.C. - The execution of a convicted cop killer was blocked Thursday by the South Carolina Supreme Court, a week after a woman recanted her trial testimony and said she was the one who pulled the trigger.
Richard Charles Johnson, 36, was scheduled to be executed by injection Friday for the 1985 shooting death of a state trooper on Interstate 95.
The court's five justices stayed the execution, saying they needed more time to examine material submitted both by Johnson's lawyers and prosecutors. The justices promised to rule by Nov. 10.
Late last week Connie Hess, who was with Johnson that day and whose testimony was used against him at two trials, said it was she and not Johnson who killed the trooper.
Israel deports suspected zealots
JERUSALEM - In its third operation against Christian doomsday groups in a year, Israel on Thursday began deporting 20 foreigners suspected of planning violent acts during the millennium year.
With Christian pilgrims heading to Israel for the celebration of the birth of Jesus, Israeli police have been on alert for religious fanatics who believe they can facilitate the second coming of Christ through violent acts or mass suicide. A special police unit has been established to deal with the threat.
On Monday, Israel arrested 17 Americans, two Britons and two Australians, all members of the House of Prayer and Solomon's Temple groups, on the Mount of Olives.
Climate changes rapidly, study says
WASHINGTON - An ice age that gripped the Earth for thousands of years ended abruptly 15,000 years ago when temperatures soared, according to new findings that suggest the world's climate can change in a few decades.
The study prompts fresh concerns that climate change from global warming could happen suddenly, experts say.
"There was a 16-degree abrupt warming at the end of the last ice age," said Jeffrey Severinghaus, lead author of a study to be published today in the journal Science. "It happened within just a couple of decades. The old idea was that the temperature would change over a thousand years. But we found it was much faster."
BRIEFLY
-- The Justice Department filed suit Thursday to strip a retired Pennsylvania mechanic of his citizenship on grounds he served as a Nazi SS guard at three concentration camps during World War II. The department's Nazi-hunting Office of Special Investigations alleged that Theodor Szehinskyj, born in Poland in 1924, was a guard at Gross- Rosen Concentration Camp, Warsaw Concentration Camp and Sachsenshausen Concentration Camp.
-- President Clinton conceded Thursday that his impeachment scandal may hurt Vice President Gore's election hopes, acknowledging that "a lot of people who may not like me may hold it against him."
-- A man convicted of raping and killing a 94-year-old woman was executed by injection Thursday in Texas. Domingo Cantu, 31, was the 28th inmate executed in the state this year and the 82nd nationwide, the most since 83 were put to death in 1952.

Energy levy plans fuel big consumers' anger: [London edition]

Abstract: Critics argue that the levy, which ministers proposed in March, could damage the manufacturing industry, cost thousands of jobs and fail to help the environment. But the government believes that the tax will bring clear environmental benefits. It would, it claims, help the country meet its short-term goals on stabilising greenhouse gas emissions and put it in a stronger position to meet the increasingly stringent targets needed to delay catastrophic climate change. Moreover, ministers stress that the proposal is revenue-neutral. Illustrative figures suggest that it would raise £1.75bn in its first full year from April 2001, which would be fully offset by cuts in employers' national insurance contributions from 12.2 per cent to 11.7.

Full text: Plans to tax the energy used by businesses has unleashed a barrage of criticism against the government.
Critics argue that the levy, which ministers proposed in March, could damage the manufacturing industry, cost thousands of jobs and fail to help the environment.
But the government believes that the tax will bring clear environmental benefits. It would, it claims, help the country meet its short-term goals on stabilising greenhouse gas emissions and put it in a stronger position to meet the increasingly stringent targets needed to delay catastrophic climate change.
Moreover, ministers stress that the proposal is revenue-neutral. Illustrative figures suggest that it would raise £1.75bn in its first full year from April 2001, which would be fully offset by cuts in employers' national insurance contributions from 12.2 per cent to 11.7.
The Treasury has indicated that this would imply a levy of 0.21p per kWh for coal and gas and 0.6p per kWh for electricity.
In March, it suggested that energy intensive industries that negotiated efficiency improvements with the government would be offered a 50 per cent reduction in the rate of the levy.
Big industrial energy users such as steel and chemicals companies have been leading the protests against the levy, arguing for discounts of up to 95 per cent. They have high energy costs, and argue that they are doing all they can to improve efficiency.
The levy, they claim, would merely make them uncompetitive against their overseas rivals and, according to research by Business Strategies, would cost 156,000 jobs over the next 10 years.
These high consumers of energy are infuriated by the government's insistance that the levy is revenue neutral, and point out that cuts in national insurance contributions benefit large employers, notably in the public sector, at the expense of manufacturers that tend to be less labour intensive.
However, Michael Meacher, environment minister, says experience has shown that key industrial sectors can typically save 15-20 per cent of their energy costs if they focus on the issue. The tax would change the perception that energy prices were going to go on falling, which has reduced the incentive to introduce energy efficiency measures.
While acknowledging that some companies will lose under the levy, Mr Meacher says that some important industrial sectors are net gainers including telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and construction.
He cites research by Cambridge Econometrics, an economic research group, that suggested a net job gain of 14,000 jobs from the levy.
While the government has found few supporters for the tax in industry, environmentalists have rallied round.
In a joint letter to the chancellor this summer, the directors of the UK's main environmental organisations argued that "the levy sends a clear signal to business, and to wider society, that we are serious about tackling climate change.
"We would urge you to stand firm on your proposals," they said. "Future generations will thank you." Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Call for energy tax concession
Paul Rata of British Alcan and President of the Aluminium Federation made a plea for further UK energy tax concessions at the federation's annual dinner last night. "We are pleased that energy used in electrolysis for primary aluminium production is now exempt from the levy, but this does not go far enough, leaving the balance of our industry critically exposed. It would logically follow therefore that if the government wishes to protect primary production and also wishes to encourage recycling, then energy used in recycling should also be exempt. We also believe that energy consumption required for environmental protection measures should be excluded from the levy."
When first announced by the UK chancellor in March the Climate Change Levy was presented as neutral to business as a whole: it would cost £1.7bn, but would be balanced by a reduction in National Insurance Contributions (Nics). However, it looks likely to cost the UK aluminium industry £40m a year, with only £2m coming back through reductions in national insurance contributions. Most of the burden would have fallen on the primary smelters, which would have faced "certain closure", said Mr Rata. That threat has now been removed, but the industry is hoping for additional exemptions in the chancellor's pre-Budget report early next month.

Abstract: Gordon Brown, the chancellor, is expected to soften the blow of the £1.75bn climate change levy by offering larger rebates for energy intensive industries when he announces the details next month. Although industry leaders have been concerned by the Treasury's attitude during negotiations over the levy, government insiders say the Treasury has taken on board warnings about the impact of the proposals on competitiveness. The Confederation of British Industry and individual sector lobby groups have been pressing for bigger discounts for energy intensive industries that negotiate energy efficiency improvements. The government had suggested that discounts of up to 50 per cent could be available.

Full text: Gordon Brown, the chancellor, is expected to soften the blow of the £1.75bn climate change levy by offering larger rebates for energy intensive industries when he announces the details next month.
Although industry leaders have been concerned by the Treasury's attitude during negotiations over the levy, government insiders say the Treasury has taken on board warnings about the impact of the proposals on competitiveness.
"It has been a genuine consultation and the Treasury recognises the need for flexibility in efforts to meet our environmental targets," said one government member.
The Confederation of British Industry and individual sector lobby groups have been pressing for bigger discounts for energy intensive industries that negotiate energy efficiency improvements. The government had suggested that discounts of up to 50 per cent could be available.
But the CBI has argued that in return for discounts of up to 95 per cent, industries could offer demanding energy efficiency programmes that would allow the government to meet its environmental targets.
It also urged the government to cut the size of the levy so that, when overset by proposed cuts in national insurance contributions, the impact on individual sectors would be revenue neutral.
Stephen Byers, trade and industry secretary, told industry leaders he would argue their case in government. Environment ministers also offered a sympathetic hearing. But industry lobby groups have complained about what appears to be intransigence from the Treasury. There has also been frustration that the Treasury has declined to be involved in negotiations between individual industry groups and the environment department.
"There has been a distinct lack of 'joined-up government' on this," said one industrialist.
The government has been surprised by the strength of opposition to the tax. "Ministers thought they would be able to get away with it with relatively little problem like the windfall tax on the utilities," said one Labour MP.
"But industry felt they were unfairly being singled out given that big polluters like cars and domestic fuel were excluded for political reasons."
Meanwhile the CBI yesterday called on the government to offer additional tax incentives to encourage the development of a broadly based trading scheme in greenhouse gases.
It outlined a vision of an ambitious scheme that would provide a cost-effective way to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The scheme could eventually embrace a large swathe of British industry and could potentially encourage businesses to invest in environmental projects in the domestic and transport sectors.
A small-scale version of the scheme, backed by 25 large companies, could begin running from April 2001, the CBI said. Companies would volunteer for binding emissions limits and then trade together to ensure limits were met in the most cost-effective way. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

Vermont was among the states most negatively affected by weather disasters in 1998, a study by a national advocacy group indicates. The report is providing fodder for an upcoming conference on the economic effects of climate change in the state.
The study, due for release today, shows that Vermont had the sixth greatest financial losses per capita due to natural disasters, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund. The rank was based on federal disaster aid figures and insurance losses. The group said global warming is creating a rising number of weather extremes and disasters throughout the United States.
A January ice storm and a series of summertime flash floods made 1998 a particularly bad year in Vermont. The state received $$@$!14.5 million in federal disaster relief, said Joan Lindsay of the Vermont Emergency Management Agency. The USPIRG report showed Vermont sustained $$@$!78,355,625 in damage covered by insurance and federal money.
However, weather experts said individual bouts of severe weather, like the ice storm and floods, cannot be blamed solely on global warming.
"There are other factors involved and one is climatic variability. Different events in our atmosphere
tend to go in cycles,'' State Climatologist Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux said. She noted that Vermont could be in a cycle that tends to create particularly severe storms.
Almost all climatologists agree that the earth has warmed by at least one degree this century. The burning of fossil fuels adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and that gas traps heat, warming the earth, scientists said. The warming might contribute to more severe heat waves and droughts, and could create increasingly powerful storms.
A Nov. 12 conference is scheduled at the University of Vermont to examine how rising global temperatures might affect Vermont's economy. Warmer temperatures would impact farmers, the ski industry and tourism, said George Tyler, an organizer of the conference. If disasters become more common, the state will end up spending more money on road, property and utility repairs, he said.
"The report presents a pretty powerful argument that the scientific community isn't kidding when they say that climate change may be the most important issue we face in the next century,'' Tyler said.
So far this year, the state's weather has not been as severe as in 1998. Still, state and federal authorities are mulling whether to declare parts of Vermont a disaster area because of damage to utilities and roads caused by Tropical Storm Floyd in September, Lindsay said. The state also suffered damage from a summer drought and heat waves, along with severe July thunderstorms.

DTI backs emissions trading CLIMATE CHANGE LEVY GOVERNMENT SAYS IMPACT WILL BE OFFSET BY OTHER MEASURES: [London edition]

Abstract: The government sent a clear signal yesterday that it will allow emissions trading to offset the impact of the climate change levy on companies proposed by Gordon Brown, the chancellor. The Treasury and John Prescott's Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions have refused to say whether they will accept an emissions trading scheme being drawn up by industrialists.

Full text: The government sent a clear signal yesterday that it will allow emissions trading to offset the impact of the climate change levy on companies proposed by Gordon Brown, the chancellor.
The Treasury and John Prescott's Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions have refused to say whether they will accept an emissions trading scheme being drawn up by industrialists.
However, the trade and industry department makes clear in its response to a critical report on the proposed levy by the Commons trade and industry committee that emissions trading is part of government policy on pollution control.
The response does not say how such a scheme might work. But the Confederation of British Industry and the Advisory Council on Business and the Environment are expected to give details today of proposals put to ministers.
The DTI response says the climate levy, which is intended to help the UK meet pollution control obligations set at Kyoto, will "sit alongside other approaches, including emissions trading, regulation, voluntary action and negotiated agreements".
The DTI says it welcomes the CBI/ACBE initiative, and shares its aim of getting a scheme into operation "well in advance" of 2008, when pollution targets must start being met.
The report also signals that energy efficient combined heat and power plants may be exempted, and that it may back down on its refusal to allow tax incentives for investments to improve energy efficiency.
The report says the government thinks "CHP generation can make a valuable contribution to achieving emissions reduction, and is concerned that the final arrangements for the levy do not discourage the development of CHP."
It is considering tax incentives "very carefully" in the light of claims that efficient new generating technology might be otherwise hampered.
The response hints that ministers will find more than the £50m promised for investment in energy efficiency and support for renewable energy.
Business groups were unimpressed. Martin Temple, director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, said he was "extremely disappointed" that the government's thinking had failed to move on.
Business has argued for up to 95 per cent discounts on the levy for a wide range of companies; more investment in energy saving and renewables; and abandonment of Mr Brown's insistence on raising £1.75bn for recycling through lower national insurance contributions.
AstraZeneca, British Sugar and PowerGen were among companies that lobbied parliament yesterday, claiming that a failure to exempt CHP from the levy could undermine a key source of competition in the power generation market.

Full text: Watch out for the Koreans
The disclosure that Cammell Laird, the ship repair group, is seeking DTI permission to restart shipbuilding at its Birkenhead yard reflects a big increase in competitiveness caused by changes in subsidy rules. Martin Stopford, managing director of Clarkson Research, the shipping consultancy, says Cammell is not alone. There has been talk at other yards of trying to break into the market for sophisticated ships in which east Asian yards do not compete. One promising area is thought to be fast ferries, such as the Australian-built ships operating on the Channel. Watch out, though, warns Mr Stopford. There are whispers that Korea's highly efficient yards may be thinking of having a go at the same market.
* What is Gordon Brown's proposed climate change levy on businesses intended to achieve? Treasury officials recoil in horror at suggestions it is a tax-raising measure designed to allow the chancellor to cut employers' National Insurance Contributions. But the levy will make businesses focus on energy use only if they know how much they are paying. The Treasury is still thinking about whether the tax should be identified separately on fuel bills. But Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, says he has already been told by the environment department this is not likely. Splitting out the levy seems easy enough, says Mr Warren. If the government really wants to change behaviour, that is. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Full text: Climate change levy under attack
THE GOVERNMENT faces a two-pronged challenge to its planned climate change levy this week. The British Chambers of Commerce will use its pre-Budget submission to attack the uneven impact that the levy will have on different sectors of the UK economy. The levy is designed to help Britain meet its target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2010. The British Chambers of Commerce said the plan to recycle the proceeds back to industry by cutting National Insurance payments would penalise heavy industry at the expensive of the services sector.
Meanwhile, a committee of MPs today publishes a report into the levy. In July the Trade and Industry committee said the levy "could prove a blunt instrument which does considerable damage to sectors of the economy already struggling to maintain profitability".

Budget 2000 is Brown's big chance for tax reform: [FOREIGN Edition]

Author: Hogg, Sarah

Abstract: ALTHOUGH A little more acknowledgement of his inheritance would be seemly - this Chancellor was born with the silver spoon of low inflation in his mouth - Gordon Brown has some cause for his complacency in the state of monetary policy. Now he must turn to the Treasury's day job: budget policy. Gordon Brown's looming surplus, or "war chest", puts him under pressure from an overstretched health service, and for real extra policemen rather than the Home Secretary's statistical artifacts. But he also needs to think about tax. This year, with the exception of national insurance reform, he showed a distressing tendency to tinker. By 2001, he will be in pre-election mode. By 2002, if he is still Chancellor, he may have no breath left for anything but the euro. Budget 2000, on which work now begins, is his big chance for tax reform. First, to recognise weaknesses in existing tax plans. The chart, adapted from the Budget Red Book, shows how the Chancellor has been leaning heavily on certain taxes. But he cannot go on up the excise "escalator" for ever. Higher fuel duties are causing real political trouble, particularly in the countryside.

Full text: ALTHOUGH A little more acknowledgement of his inheritance would be seemly - this Chancellor was born with the silver spoon of low inflation in his mouth - Gordon Brown has some cause for his complacency in the state of monetary policy. Now he must turn to the Treasury's day job: budget policy.
Gordon Brown's looming surplus, or "war chest", puts him under pressure from an overstretched health service, and for real extra policemen rather than the Home Secretary's statistical artifacts. But he also needs to think about tax. This year, with the exception of national insurance reform, he showed a distressing tendency to tinker. By 2001, he will be in pre-election mode. By 2002, if he is still Chancellor, he may have no breath left for anything but the euro. Budget 2000, on which work now begins, is his big chance for tax reform.
His must-do list should have at least four items on it.
First, to recognise weaknesses in existing tax plans. The chart, adapted from the Budget Red Book, shows how the Chancellor has been leaning heavily on certain taxes. But he cannot go on up the excise "escalator" for ever. Higher fuel duties are causing real political trouble, particularly in the countryside.
Smuggling has reached such a pitch that it is estimated some 75 per cent of hand-rolled tobacco escapes duty. And built into Mr Brown's numbers are an extra 5 per cent a year on tobacco and 6 per cent a year on fuel, over and above inflation, in each of the next two years. Ouch.
Secondly, to get a grip on eco-taxes. These are God's gift to a Chancellor, providing a moral underpinning to mere money-raising. But a badly designed policy will backfire. Those paying huge petrol duties do notice that the Chancellor wantonly abandoned the (modest) taxation of domestic fuel. The climate change levy is pencilled in to raise a whopping pounds 1.75bn in its first year (2001-02), but its impact is still unclear.
The landfill tax has been successfully launched, but as the rate of tax goes up, more trouble will have to be taken to prevent fly- tipping and use the proceeds to encourage the use of renewable, biodegradable and reusable materials. The traditional mistake is for the Treasury is to concentrate on the numbers while leaving design to other departments. That was how we got the poll tax. Again, ouch.
Thirdly, and for Gordon Brown perhaps most importantly, to decide whether to build a full-blown tax-credit system. The bricks he has put in place for a "bridge to work" have helped some low income families, but have led them into a half-way house whose lay-out is immensely difficult to understand. And the Government has so far hung back from full integration of national insurance for fear of putting the headline rate of income tax up. If it is going to be courageous, Budget 2000 is the time.
Fourthly, to think again about savings taxes. Government policy now hangs on successfully weaning as many people as possible off welfare dependency. An excellent new report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows how far from that goal we are.
The new evidence is not so much in the headline findings - that wealth has become more unequally distributed in the past 20 years, and 10 per cent of the population have no assets at all - since anyone who supposed we could get rid of all social security was kidding himself. Where there is real food for thought is in the pattern of assets held by the majority of the population between the extremes of rich and poor.
Most household wealth (about pounds 2.6bn net in the mid-1990s) is in tax-favoured illiquid assets, such as houses. Home ownership among the young peaked in the late 1980s, when tax relief first began to be withdrawn. In short, tax incentives do work. But only if they are well-understood.
At all levels of income, this report shows, more-educated people tend to have more savings. This could be because, following the "life- cycle" model used to forecast savings, highly educated people have more confidence in their future earning power. Or it could be that they are better informed about the inadequacy of social security. Or it could simply be that you need a PhD to understand ISAs.
This report provides further evidence that the complexity of financial products and their tax wrappers is a serious barrier to saving. As chairman of an investment trust, I winced at the report's analysis of the dominance of individual privatisation shares in middle-income portfolios.
I am sure that follows less from a deliberate decision to take risk than from the trusts' failure to communicate ways of holding equities in a form that spreads risk. But there is a lesson for government too: if you want to persuade people to save, you have to make it simple to do so, and you have to go on giving the same message for a long time.
Privatisation shareholding followed a wave of single-minded advertising campaigns. Home ownership took two generations to establish. A nation of savers will be even harder to create, unless both financial services and government cure themselves of their appetite for complexity.
Unfortunately, both have an interest in being able to say that their product is different and better. To be fair to the Treasury, it has - led by the Office of Fair Trading - tried to simplify ISAs by introducing "CAT" standards. But the basic design was over- complicated, and, though improved, still is. The wider problem is that - as the table makes clear - the savings terrain is criss- crossed with different tax rules, fine in theory, daunting in practice.
The deeply rooted instinct of the Treasury is to simplify by levelling taxes up. That would be a mistake, in both policy and politics. The middle classes spent the past two years breathing sighs of relief, but electors are not long grateful for small mercies. Now they are beginning to notice that capital gains tax is biting, despite the changes, and that familiar income tax reliefs are finally disappearing. The last vestige of mortgage interest relief goes next April, as does the marriage allowance, with a delay before the promised child tax credit is introduced.
Meanwhile, the middle classes are being asked to pay higher national insurance, despite being told that it is not going to provide them with anything much in future. They are nervous about pensions relief.
Moreover, since financial activity is even more mobile than tobacco, capital taxes are an area where governments have to be particularly sensitive to international competition. In the Anglo- Saxon world, Australia is now following the United States in bringing down the rate of capital gains tax.
If he embarks on a wide tax-reforming Budget, the Chancellor could take the opportunity to upstage his opponents by abolishing stamp duty and cutting CGT. Now that would cause them to mutter: "ouch".

Industry launches plan to stall climate change levy: [FOREIGN Edition]

Author: Michael Harrison Business Editor

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/industry-launches-plan-stall-climate-change-levy/docview/311561055/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: BRITAIN'S BIG energy users are accelerating plans to launch an emissions trading system in an effort to stall the introduction of the Government's climate change levy. The Confederation of British Industry will announce this week that it intends to have a full-blown trading system in operation by next April - a year ahead of the levy being introduced.

Full text: BRITAIN'S BIG energy users are accelerating plans to launch an emissions trading system in an effort to stall the introduction of the Government's climate change levy.
The Confederation of British Industry will announce this week that it intends to have a full-blown trading system in operation by next April - a year ahead of the levy being introduced.
Originally, the CBI had planned to launch a trial system, enabling a few firms to start trading emissions permits among themselves by the end of this year. The full system would then have been launched towards the end of next year in advance of the introduction of the climate change levy in April 2001.
Now, however, the CBI believes it can have the system up and running much earlier. Successful operation of a permit trading scheme will be vital if industry is to persuade the Government that such a system will be just as effective as an energy tax in ensuring that Britain meets the emission reduction targets it signed up to at the Kyoto summit.
At a meeting between government ministers and energy intensive users last week, it was suggested that both Stephen Byers, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, and Michael Meacher, the Environment minister, were becoming more sympathetic to industry's case.
However, the Treasury minister, Stephen Timms, was said to have refused to budge from the announcement set out by the Chancellor in the last Budget. The climate change levy will cost industry pounds 1.2bn, with steelmakers alone facing a bill of pounds 238m.
The intention is to recycle the proceeds from the tax by cutting employers' National Insurance contributions. However, industry calculates that this will only reduce its bill by pounds 140m a year.
The levy is designed to help Britain meet its target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent of their 1990 levels by 2010.
However, industry argues that such a tax will only have the effect of rendering British business uncompetitive and forcing investment to go abroad. It also argues that fiscal penalties are not the effective way of cutting energy use and thereby reducing emissions.
The CBI is expected to propose a series of options for operating an emissions- trading system, including auctioning of the permits.
The Government has offered some industries, including steel, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, a 50 per cent rebate on the climate levy. But they argue that this is inadequate.

NAC Orchestra makes best of musical cliche: [Final Edition]

Abstract: The musicians at least seemed to believe in the music. [Pinchas Zukerman] took the customary dual role of solo violinist and conductor, conducting with his bow, and quite loosely, often strangely --at times his style seemed more like choreography than conducting. Hardly anybody in the string orchestra looked at him for a cue, and why should they? By now they can play this program in their sleep. But they didn't play sleepily, at least after the Spring concerto, which felt automatic. On his 1670 Guarnerius violin Zukerman played with virtuosity, fire, lots of ornament, a sensitive line and sometimes a bit too much oily romantic portamento to suit the baroque. There was also a misinterpretation by the first viola of her part in the second movement of the first concerto. The repeated two-note refrain to the shepherd's plaintive violin melody is supposed to be the yap of his dog, not the vibrato-sodden love song she made of it.

Full text: NATIONAL ARTS CENTRE ORCHESTRA
With conductor and violinist Pinchas Zukerman,
Oct. 23 and 24, Chan Centre
As part of its continuing 11-city Canadian tour, the National Arts Centre Orchestra, our light, classically-sized, 46-member orchestral ship of state, pulled into port for two sold-out weekend concerts at the Chan Centre.
Touring, nationally and internationally, is one part of the mandate of the Ottawa-based orchestra, which is 30 years old this season. It's celebrating this anniversary and, no doubt as well, the recent profile-enhancement of attracting to its helm an American icon like Pinchas Zukerman, particularly since the orchestra has spent the last few seasons without a musical director after the departure of Trevor Pinnock.
Zukerman's celebrity is an undeniable boost to the orchestra's image, even though his commitment to the NACO is only eight weeks a year, plus tours and recordings. The Israel-born violinist and conductor retains many ties elsewhere in the United States.
In view of Zukerman's celebrity, the Chan concerts, which were filled to the choral lofts behind the stage, were a sure thing. Even so, extra insurance was taken out with a no-miss program: Vivaldi's The Four Seasons and Mendelssohn's "Italian"Symphony. You might wonder what is served by featuring a cultural cliche like The Four Seasons, which is beautiful, certainly, but something that everybody knows by heart and has been recorded about 150 times. The agenda of this tour is multiple, however. It includes, aside from student workshops and interactive web events on the NAC website, even a commitment, vis-a-vis The Four Seasons, to "the environment and climate change," according to the publicity. This seems a bit of a stretch, something knocked up by a committee. But if anyone spares a tree after listening to Vivaldi (whose music has been around for 250 years) I'll take it all back.
The musicians at least seemed to believe in the music. Zukerman took the customary dual role of solo violinist and conductor, conducting with his bow, and quite loosely, often strangely --at times his style seemed more like choreography than conducting. Hardly anybody in the string orchestra looked at him for a cue, and why should they? By now they can play this program in their sleep. But they didn't play sleepily, at least after the Spring concerto, which felt automatic. On his 1670 Guarnerius violin Zukerman played with virtuosity, fire, lots of ornament, a sensitive line and sometimes a bit too much oily romantic portamento to suit the baroque. There was also a misinterpretation by the first viola of her part in the second movement of the first concerto. The repeated two-note refrain to the shepherd's plaintive violin melody is supposed to be the yap of his dog, not the vibrato-sodden love song she made of it.
Mendelssohn's sunny, infectious, almost literally mercurial Italian Symphony (its rapid, light, breathless pace evokes the beat of winged heels of Mercury, the god of message) was just about all it should have been: racing strings balanced by wonderfully fleet woodwind chords (it's been a while since we've heard horn playing like that from the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra) and a general feeling of vivacity.
The other piece was modern-Canadian, the Polish-born composer Peter Koprowski's Epitaph, a dark, harmonically rich dirge that evokes a cross between Frank Bridge and Debussy, which was gravely and purely played by the NACO string section. The encore, Beethoven's The Creatures of Prometheus, was just as stylish.

Full text: Re "Gasoline, heating bills would soar under Kyoto: study," Calgary Herald, Oct. 15.
In the energy industry study released to the federal government and obtained by the Herald, the fearmongers are once again clamouring that we mustn't dare take out even a modest insurance policy against the growing threat of climate change for fear that it will devastate our economy. Setting aside for a moment the Quebec ice storm, Manitoba's Red River flood and Calgary's warm winter and cool summer of 1999, I wonder if their study looked at the many fringe benefits of domestically reducing use of fossil fuels.
These would include reduced levels of acid rain, smog -- which causes 18,000 premature deaths in Canada annually in people with asthma, bronchitis and emphysema -- as well as lung cancer due to vehicle exhaust.
We'd likely see a more physically fit populace, as some people may opt for walking to the corner store instead of automatically hopping into the car to drive three blocks. Streets would be safer with less traffic. We might even get to know our neighbours better while we meet them on the bus or cleaning the front yard with a rake rather than a noisy gas-powered leafblower. And we could position ourselves for competing in the global marketplace for renewable energy.
The individual and societal benefits of relying less on fossil fuels are many and far-reaching; if we listen only to the energy industry, however, we'll ignore these benefits because they are not economically quantifiable, at least not by the fox who wants the gate left off the chicken coop.

Abstract: The 1970s were a period of great growth for the city of Prince Albert said local retailer Herschel Davidner. In his recollection, the city's business community evolved with the arrival of new people. Aside from changes to downtown, [Davidner] said Prince Albert experienced a period of significant growth during the seventies, after seeing the development of the pulp mill and the burning of the last bonded debt in the '60s. "The pulp mill had a huge impact on the city of Prince Albert," said Davidner. "The mill poured money into the development of this city and provided jobs for countless people. They have been, and continue to be, a great community member."

Full text:   As the year 2000 approaches, the Prince Albert Daily Herald is looking back at the history of this region.
Today Herald reporter Thomas Porter goes back to the 1970s when the Raiders came to life, and the building of a mall changed the look of the city forever.
Each month this year the Herald examines the important moments in the history of the region as 1999 moves toward 2000.
- - -
The 1970s were a period of great growth for the city of Prince Albert said local retailer Herschel Davidner. In his recollection, the city's business community evolved with the arrival of new people.
"The downtown used to be a vibrant, thriving retail centre. There were no vacancies," said Davidner. "When the South Hill Mall was built in '72, the retail space in the city was effectively doubled."
It was the beginning of change in the retail sector, said Davidner, one that spelled the end for the downtown shopper.
"When they were talking about building the thing (the mall), I asked myself `Do they expect to have twice the sales with twice the space?"' said Davidner.
Many businesses took to the mall, leaving empty storefronts in the downtown core. Despite the changing face of the city's center, Davidner's Clothing and Western Wear enjoyed favourable sales throughout the '70s.
"We noticed lower sales totals than the previous year for about a year after the mall came in," said Davidner. "Sales gradually returned allowing us to expand our location at the time."
Some retailers didn't weather the climate change as well, said Davidner, with some moving into the new mall and others disappearing all together.
"We used to have three shoe stores on Central Avenue and three high quality menswear retailers," said Davidner. "You can see what's happened to the downtown area. Things have changed and efforts to revitalize have had limited success."
"You didn't see lawyers and insurance agencies on the ground floor," said Davidner. "Second Avenue has become the main drag now and downtown locations that were once prime business locations are going for less money."
Aside from changes to downtown, Davidner said Prince Albert experienced a period of significant growth during the seventies, after seeing the development of the pulp mill and the burning of the last bonded debt in the '60s.
"The pulp mill had a huge impact on the city of Prince Albert," said Davidner. "The mill poured money into the development of this city and provided jobs for countless people. They have been, and continue to be, a great community member."
With an increase in population brought on by new jobs and new money, existing buildings became crowded and translated into a need for a additional space.
Carlton Comprehensive High School was built onto the Technical High School on Sixth Avenue East in the mid-1970s, said Bill Smiley of the Prince Albert Historical Society, along with other familiar landmarks of today.
"A second police station was built where the Northcote Manor stands in 1974," said Smiley. "The new fire hall was also built on 15th Street East."
The J.M. Cuelenaere Public Library took shape in 1972 shortly after the construction of the Comuniplex and new subdivisions like Crescent Heights, said Smiley.
"There was a lot of new development in the 1970s," said Smiley. "The city was growing rapidly and needed new facilities like schools, high rises and the mall."
Former Herald managing editor Wayne Roznowsky, who worked in the sports department at the time, recalls the decade as devoid of economic worry; a time when employment was plentiful.
"If you didn't like the job you had, you just went and found another one," said Roznowsky. "It was a time of great optimism, you didn't need to worry about what you did or didn't get out of university."
He recounted the opening of the mammoth Carlton Comprehensive as the day the high school dynamic changed for good.
"It (Carlton) pretty much absorbed four other schools and brought the total from five to two; St. Mary and Carlton," he said.
Illustration Black & White Photo: Herald file photos / BOOM TOWN -- The 1970s will be remebered by many Prince Albert residents as a time of great growth and change. With low interest rates and a growing population, construction and development was on the rise. With a new mall, schools and housing erupting from the ground, the city skyline would be forever changed. ;

Full text: The Government's climate change levy would increase the aluminium industry's costs by 30 per cent, a major conference was told yesterday.
Dr David Harris, secretary of the Aluminium Stockholders' Association, said it represented another blow to manufacturing.
Energy consumption has to be reduced by 20 per cent to win a reduction in the levy.
The Government is expected to collect pounds 1.75 billion from the levy but it will reduce National Insurance contributions by five per cent.
Talks were held earlier this week between the aluminium industry and Trade and Industry Secretary Mr Stephen Byers, along with representatives of the Environment Department and the Treasury, about the levy.
The big users of energy in the manufacturing sector would be badly hit by the levy while service industries would virtually escape and still get the benefit of lower NI contributions.
"We do not yet know what the levy will be," said Dr Harris. "All we have is a document from Customs and Excise. The problem we face is that the levy will not be applied in other European countries."
Members of the association from throughout the UK held a meeting at the Marriott Forest of Arden Hotel at Meriden to debate the future of the UK manufacturing industry.
Ms Helen Southworth, chairman of the Commons all party aluminium group, said the Government was recognising the changing needs of industry through its cross-department strategy.
Mrs Sue Battle, chief executive of Birmingham Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, both said there was a need for more training and higher education had to play a greaterrole in securing the future of the manufacturing industry.
Mr Morris said 50 per cent of his union membership was working in the manufacturing sector.
It was essential for interested groups to come together and create a training culture to ensure that economic stability was not disturbed.

New energy tax would cost pounds 26m a year, warns union: [CITY Edition]

Abstract: Mrs Carol Puddephatt, horticultural policy adviser for the NFU East Midlands, said: "Growers will be hit hard if this levy is imposed. They have already made every effort to reduce their use of energy. Many small growers could be forced to leave the industry and jobs will be lost for rural locations. In the report, The Impact of an Energy Tax on British Farmers and Growers, the NFU states that farmers and growers should be exempt from the tax, which is proposed to start in April 2001. Launching the report, NFU deputy president Mr Tony Pexton said: "This levy would have a severe financial impact on farmers and growers. But more than that, it simply would not achieve its environmental targets.

Full text: A proposed Government tax on energy would cost British farmers and growers pounds 26 million annually while failing to deliver significant environmental benefits.
The protected horticulture sector - one of the most energy efficient in the world - would be worst hit by the Climate Change Levy, a National Farmers' Union report says.
It will result in an average cost of pounds 12,500 per hectare for every grower.
A survey of NFU members shows the increase in energy costs of growing produce would be up to 54 per cent under the new tax, with the extra costs ranging from pounds 1,000 to pounds 1 million per business.
Mrs Carol Puddephatt, horticultural policy adviser for the NFU East Midlands, said: "Growers will be hit hard if this levy is imposed. They have already made every effort to reduce their use of energy. Many small growers could be forced to leave the industry and jobs will be lost for rural locations.
"For horticulture there is an estimated yearly loss in the profit of pounds 12,500 per hectare."
In the report, The Impact of an Energy Tax on British Farmers and Growers, the NFU states that farmers and growers should be exempt from the tax, which is proposed to start in April 2001.
Launching the report, NFU deputy president Mr Tony Pexton said: "This levy would have a severe financial impact on farmers and growers. But more than that, it simply would not achieve its environmental targets.
"Businesses would be forced into ruin or move abroad, simply exporting the problem. Our industry is already one of the most energy efficient and we believe there are other, more effective measures which could achieve the Government's aims."
The NFU opposes the levy because, it says, British growers are already some of the most energy efficient in the world.
With an increase in energy efficiency of 25 per cent over the last ten years, the NFU believes that a further reduction in emissions can be achieved through present and planned measures without the tax.
The levy would cost the industry pounds 26 million while only leading to a reduction in National Insurance Contributions of pounds 9 million.
This financial impact would be too great to be absorbed by the industry, which is made up of hundreds of small businesses, with many farmers and growers forced out of business.
The NFU maintains the tax would not achieve its aim of benefiting the environment.
Many horticulture businesses would move abroad to climates more suitable for growing greenhouse crops while others may switch to using cheaper but less environmentally friendly energy sources.
More than 40,000 people are employed in horticulture, excluding seasonal workers.

Abstract: The favourite scapegoat for strange meteorological goings on in the 1990s has been El Nino, a periodic warming of the southern and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, or its twin sister La Nina, a cooling current in the same area. Using the El Nino as a scapegoat merely pushes the mystery to a deeper level. Why has El Nino been causing so much more trouble than it used to? Records show El Nino events have been getting stronger since the late 1970s, with the most severe events on record occurring in 1982- 83 and in 1997-98. The longest El Nino on record lasted from 1990 to mid-1995.

Full text: Gordon Toole remembers the day it was so cold that spit froze before it hit the ground.
Toole was one of about 20 men working at a military airport at Snag, Yukon, when the temperature plunged to the deepest low ever recorded in North America.
"You can't breathe through your nostrils in air that temperature, it's almost as though they're blocked or frozen," he says from Snag, about 320 kilometres northwest of Yellowknife. "You have to breath through your mouth but they're shallow breaths.
"You cannot take deep breaths because they just catch in your throat, you're gasping."
Toole recalls the crystal clarity of sounds. He could distinctly hear the barking of dogs in a village some five kilometres away. An airplane overhead was deafening.
As an experiment, the men flipped a saucer of water into the air at waist height: it landed on the ground in hard pellets.
The temperature was so low it couldn't be recorded on a mercury thermometer. Even in an alcohol thermometer, the liquid sank below the lowest temperature mark, settling into the bulb at the bottom.
They marked the point with a small file -- a pen wouldn't work -- and sent the thermometer to Toronto. Days later the reading was confirmed: --62.2C.
The record set at Snag on Feb. 3, 1947, still stands. For Canadians who seemingly never get tired of talking about the weather, it's a classic tale, especially since there were no casualties and no real damage.
Recent years have seen many weather extremes that were not so benign.
Few residents of Eastern Canada have forgotten the ice storm in 1998, when millions shivered in darkened houses or sought refuge in crowded public shelters.
Few residents of Manitoba have forgotten the flood of 1997, when the Red River turned into a vast sea, driving some 28,000 people from their homes and submerging whole towns.
The Saguenay Flood of 1996 caused massive damage, as did the Calgary hail storm of 1997. The current drought in the Prairies has helped to reduce Canada's breadbasket to a basket case as the year 2000 nears.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimates that insurance payments for extreme weather events across the country have been doubling every five to 10 years. Payouts last year reached $1.5 billion.
"The weather in Canada has been frightful," says Paul Kovaks, a spokesman for the bureau.
Munich Re of Munich, Germany, one of the world's biggest reinsurance companies, estimates global losses from weather-related natural disasters have increased to $90 billion annually from $7 billion to $8 billion annually in the 1980s.
Part of the rising toll results from population growth -- there's simply more property to be damaged, and more of it is built in risky areas like flood plains and coastlines.
Paradoxically, modern technology can also increase vulnerability to extreme weather since vital energy and communications systems across large areas are intertwined.
"The disaster is the event plus our vulnerability," says federal climatologist Roger Street.
"Higher dependence on networked energy, higher dependence on telecommunications, makes us more vulnerable."
Climatologists would like to come up with an extreme-weather index so they could measure the apparent rise in instability. One of the problems is they can't agree on how to define an extreme weather event.
The great ice storm, for example, did not involve record-setting precipitation. It resulted from multiple factors, none of which would in itself be ranked as highly unusual; it was the combination that was unusual.
The favourite scapegoat for strange meteorological goings on in the 1990s has been El Nino, a periodic warming of the southern and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, or its twin sister La Nina, a cooling current in the same area.
Climatologist David Phillips says in his recent book Blame it on the Weather that El Nino has become the scapegoat for everything from whale beachings in China to increased crime in Saskatoon.
But using the El Nino as a scapegoat merely pushes the mystery to a deeper level. Why has El Nino been causing so much more trouble than it used to?
Records show El Nino events have been getting stronger since the late 1970s, with the most severe events on record occurring in 1982- 83 and in 1997-98. The longest El Nino on record lasted from 1990 to mid-1995.
Is El Nino a messenger for something much bigger?
Few credible scientists dispute that the climate is warming: the finding has been confirmed by countless studies.
There has been great debate about whether the trend is due to natural variability or human influence. Now that debate also seems to be settled.
Over the past century the average temperature of earth has risen by close to one degree Celsius. Now the big controversy concerns how fast future warming will occur and how it will affect different regions.
Much of the research is done with computer models simulating the atmosphere -- programs so complex that they push existing hardware to its limits. The models have many warts but they're getting better.
"There's some uncertainty, but I feel much safer, much more confident making a weather forecast for the year 2090 than I do an economic or a demographic or a political kind of forecast," says Phillips of the federal Environment Department's atmospheric environment service.
For example, the models show a balmy future for Toronto.
"What Kentucky has now is what in fact Toronto will inherit in terms of its climate probably a hundred years from now.
"We've warmed up Toronto by maybe 0.6 of a degree and now we're talking about warming in the summertime of four to five degrees, five to nine degrees in the winter. There's going to be really a leap forward in terms of the climate."
Canadians may welcome the prospect of milder winters, but what about the prospect of more frequent and severe droughts, floods and storms?
"It is extreme events that will be the biggest impact on Canadians from climate change," says Gordon McBean, assistant deputy to the federal environment minister.
At the 1997 Kyoto climate conference, Canada pledged to reduce its greenhouse emissions by six per cent from 1990 levels by 2008- 2012.
But since then, emissions have continued to rise, and there is still no plan for reversing the trend.
Cutting emissions would require major changes in the way Canadians use energy, and would have an impact on virtually every industry. Disruptions in the near term might be high.
"The cost of action to reduce the risk is today, and the cost of inaction is in the future and hence there's a tendency for discounting the costs of inaction," says Henry Hengeveld, a senior adviser on climate change in the Environment Department.
The fossil fuel industry and the Alberta government have denounced the Kyoto commitment as unrealistic, and skeptics continue to find platforms for their views.

Full text: Headline in Early Edition: Insurers in push for ecology
The yachtsmen who battled the huge storm that claimed six lives during the Sydney-Hobart race last summer saw it as a freak of nature.
Likewise, the owners of the 20,000 homes damaged in Sydney's first big hail storm for eight years might well regard it simply as one out of the box.
So what if it is discovered that mankind had a hand in these events? What if, as a consequence of global warming, storms like these become more commonplace?
Some of the world's biggest insurance companies are asking these questions but, as the frequency and speed of the big winds increase and the cost of claims reaches $US15billion ($A22.8 billion) a year, they say they don't have the time to wait for answers.
The insurance industry has found itself in the eye of an environmental storm and it is preparing to assume its new role as the world's ecological police.
Nearly 90 big underwriters in 27 countries have indicated they are willing to use their financial clout to push industry towards the use of renewable energy sources.
These are the first signatories to a United Nations-sponsored insurance industry initiative, and next year UNEP, the United National Environmental Program in Geneva, will begin a drive to sign up insurance companies in Australia.
Mr Bruce Thomas, the Australian head of non-life reinsurance with the European giant, Swiss Re, says the insurance companies, especially the reinsurers, are feeling the impact of an upswing in severe weather events.
Since the 1960s the number of great natural catastrophes has risen by a factor of three, with economic losses, after adjustment for inflation, rising by a factor of nine and insured losses by a factor of 15.
"We don't know whether it is the result of man-made or man-influenced climate change or whether it is part of a cyclic movement but it will be too late if we wait to find out what is happening and why," Mr Thomas says.
By any measure, 1998 was a disaster. The mean average temperature rose 0.61 degrees and the number of natural catastrophes, which normally ranges between 530 and 600, rose to 700.
The economic loss worldwide from extreme weather reached a staggering $US93billion and insurance companies paid out $US15billion on claims for storms, hurricanes and major flooding on three continents.
In Australia three reinsurers, GIO Re, Reinsurance Corporation Australia and the failed New Cap Re felt the impact of severe storms at home and overseas. They have confirmed losses of more than $1.4billion over the past two years and the latest estimates indicate the insurance bill for the Sydney hailstorm will reach $1.5billion.
The insurance industry says in its UNEP statement that it is well placed to act as facilitators and enforcers of the December 1997 Kyoto protocol.
This international document sets the framework for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across the world through government policies and international flexible market mechanisms. The chief of these will be emissions-trading and clean-development mechanisms.
Since the Kyoto conference the insurance industry has set down its own framework document that serves notice on the business world, especially manufacturing industry, that it is prepared to judge it by its approach to sustainable development.
It suggests insurers will reward organisationsswitching from carbon fuel to renewable energies and to sanction those who don't. They will include environmental criteria in managing risk when fixing premiums and investment policies.
It points out that as much as one third of investments in global stock markets with a total capitalisation of more than $US15 trillion are managed by the insurance industry and pension fund managers.
"It is therefore in the interest of the industry to understand better the investment opportunities and challenges which will arise from measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to reduce the vulnerability of society," the UNEP insurance paper says.
In Europe and Japan, where insurance executives live under a thickening cloud of smog, underwriters have been eager to sign the UNEP document and lead by example.
Swiss Re, which writes $19billion of business a year, is developing services and insurance products aimed at managing environmental risks and reducing environmental damage, and increasingly it is including environmental criteria in its investment policy and property portfolio.
Swiss Re has also imposed a strict internal regime that requires its 9000 staff worldwide to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 10per cent by 2001. Where possible staff must teleconference rather than travel by air to meetings and they must separate and recycle their waste.
Its German-based opponent, Munich Re, has gone a step further and set up its own ecological consulting business to carry out environmental-risk analysis for industrial clients. It too insists on practising what it preaches and pays its staff a subsidy to park cars and use public transport.
Yet the farther south one travels towards the hole in the ozone layer the less concern the insurance industry shows.
Only one company in each of Australia, Argentina and South Africa appear as signatories to the UNEP insurance industry statement of Environmental commitment. New Zealand has two signatories and Chile none.
Also the insurance industry is conspicuously absent from the Greenhouse Challenge, a cooperative effort to abate greenhouse gas emissions set up by the Federal Government with industry groups that include many key organisations in the energy, transport and manufacturing sectors.
The Insurance Council of Australia, according to a spokesperson, is conducting a survey of its members for the Federal Government's Greenhouse office. She agreed it was the first step in the process of engagement and might lead eventually to an industry commitment.
Mr Aiko Bode, the coordinator of the UNEP insurance initiative, says the organisation is planning a meeting with insurance and financial service industries in Melbourne early next year.
"We think the time is ripe for Australian insurance companies and banks to come from an observer position into the circle of active players. Whether it is green funds, investment partnerships, the question of good company management and reporting; all of these elements support sustainable development.
"Enough evidence exists to suggest that good management and good environmental performance go hand in hand with above average economic returns. Environmental awareness is less a burden, it is much more a serious business opportunity," Mr Bode said.
"Personally I am convinced that those who care today will be the winners of tomorrow. I hope a few Australian companies are among them."
Mr Raymond Jones, the general manager of the QBE Insurance group, Australia's sole UNEP insurance signatory, says he is hoping that after the meeting his company will no longer be a voice in the wilderness.
He says he has been frustrated by the lack of interest of other insurers in Australia. "We got involved four years ago because we wanted to be a good corporate citizen and we wanted to understand the environment as part of a good risk assessment process."
Mr Jones says it is a slow and frustrating process and so far his company has been unable to take any step beyond public awareness to positive action.
"The marketplace does not allow us to deny cover to a client because of their record of carbon emissions. If we don't cover an errant company there are plenty of other insurers who will," he says.
Mr Phillip Toyne, a partner in the industry environment consultants EcoFutures, says Australian industry is in denial over global warming and still showing few signs of any real awakening.
A former chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Mr Toyne says he has been trying to interest Australians in green investment funds. He says by way of comparison these funds, which base decisions on strict environment and climate-influencing criteria, have taken off like a rocket overseas and are worth $US1 trillion. Here they are negligible.
He says insurance companies could play a key role. "If they perceive higher risk in terms of environmental issues and adjust premiums accordingly it would send a message to their customers that these are matters of great concern."
However, Mr Alan Tait, the head of Ecos Corporation, which advises business on ecological issues, says he has noticed an awakening of climate-change issues in the past 10 months. He believes the Australian insurance industry has been jolted by its own losses in Sydney and on Hurricane Mitch in Central America into a belated awareness of global warming.
"Until then it lived in its own comfort zone, reinforced by the attitude the Government took to Kyoto; that Australia was special and should be granted easier targets than the rest of the world," he says.

NO CANDU Canada would trade one problem for another

Abstract: It was pointed out to him, unsuccessfully, that nuclear is not a renewable source of energy in quite the same category as wind or water power and, of course, the safety considerations are always uppermost in everyone's mind. Candu reactors produce no greenhouse gas emissions but leave behind radioactive waste that remains harmful for 10,000 years.

Full text: "No can do," said Norway's environment minister, Guro Fjellanger, to our prime minister. She didn't add that he had a nerve, but I will say it. How dare he try again to have the sale of Candu reactors declared a credit against our obligations to reduce the production of greenhouse gases. We promised to reduce these by six per cent from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. We shouldn't try to weasel out of that.
He keeps trying this. He did it in Kyoto, where we made our pledge.
He did it during subsequent negotiations and he did it again this week, at the international forum on climate change. This attempt to push nuclear energy as green power is not only shoddy, it is downright irresponsible.
Prime Minister Jean Chretien has also insisted that Canada should gain emission credits for exporting the technology to countries such as China. It was pointed out to him, unsuccessfully, that nuclear is not a renewable source of energy in quite the same category as wind or water power and, of course, the safety considerations are always uppermost in everyone's mind.
Meanwhile, the United Nations is studying whether it is possible to measure the contribution of the world's forests to greenhouse gas reduction. Forests absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas. So, Canada, with some of the world's largest forests, has much at stake. That would be a much worthier contribution to reducing the harmful gases. But, then again, the Chr tien government, to outdo the right wing agenda and opposition, might decide that our forests must also be sacrificed to "comprehensive development of our natural resources."
You'd think his misadventure with putting trade ahead of human rights in the case of Indonesia and Suharto would ring a bell in his head and make him avoid trying to push Candu sales ahead of the environment. But, no. He is a repeat offender. Perhaps we should be thinking of a three-strikes-you're-out measure for politicians who try to fool all of the people all of the time. If it was only embarrassing to him, we would just cringe at one more manifestation of his strange knack to do the unexpectedly stupid, but he speaks for us and the country.
I would think it would be embarrassing to his environment minister, David Anderson, whose reputation as an environmentalist is not one to fool around with. I can't believe he would be sold on this particular expediency, no matter how practical he has to be as a politician. But, even he said that, although he understood the safety concerns, he still wanted to put nuclear power forward as part of the solution. Shame. Candu reactors produce no greenhouse gas emissions but leave behind radioactive waste that remains harmful for 10,000 years. So, Canada's position would replace one environmental hazard -- greenhouse gases -- with another, that being nuclear waste.
You'd also think that the recent Japanese nuclear misadventure would at least get his spin doctors clamoring no no, Nanette. Back in 1997, environment groups were outraged by his response to questions raised in connection with a leaked cabinet document concerning Candu exports to Turkey and sales to China. Both countries are shaky in the human rights area. The government was also giving short shrift to the proper environmental assessment. The commitment of the Chr tien government to overseas nuclear sales at all costs was considered breathtaking, at the time. It seemed ready to risk breaking Canada's laws as well as $1.5 billion to do a deal with Turkey.
That's our money folks. Almost the equivalent of what wannabe prime minister Paul Martin is piking out of the unemployment insurance fund, the so-called surplus, created through reducing access to the benefits and throwing people on the provinces' welfare rolls, which they, in turn, with Frank McKenna in the lead, have thrown out onto the street.
Moreover, because of our Candu sales to India, we now have a potential military abuse of nuclear power in that volatile part of the world, where India and Pakistan coexist testily.
What is it that Mr. Chr tien wants? Does he want to give Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy a few more hot spots in the developing world to flex his leadership ambitions on? Maybe his plan is to have Paul Martin and Lloyd Axworthy at each other throat, or falling over each other as to who is going to sell his soul the fastest -- by ignoring human rights or our environment -- while filling the government's coffer with surplus which come so handy to win elections.
We should help developing countries to avoid making the same errors that developed countries have inflicted on our planet. Instead of trying to pawn off our Candu reactors, we should be helping developing countries to choose clean air and water processes for manufacturing and urban development. These will cost more, but that's where we, of the developed world, should be putting our money.
What's more, we should be putting great efforts in developing our pollution control and prevention industry. Let's increase trade in those, instead of selling more reactors which can fall in the wrong hands at the wrong time and which depend on dangerous substances to function.
Meanwhile, Atomic Energy of Canada should be making a mammoth contribution to ensuring safer nuclear power, a safer process and a minimum of waste material to dispose of, in Canada and everywhere in the world. There is still so much left to do to achieve this. That would be an honourable way to exercise our considerable Canadian gray matter in matters nuclear, environmental, political, humanitarian and developmental.
It is shameful enough that the Liberal government in Ottawa is continuing with its agenda to buy our votes with the dough they wrenched out of our hides in unemployment insurance and other safety net benefits, but to try to make themselves look good in terms of environmental protection is beyond the pale. * * * (Claudy Lynch is a former member of Parliament.

RESEARCHERS GIVE BROADER MEANING TO `BIODIVERSITY' UW-MADISON SCIENTISTS EXPAND THE TERM TO INCLUDE THE ABILITY OF A SPECIES, AMONG A DIVERSE POPULATION, TO SURVIVE TOUGH TIMES.: [ALL EDITION]

Author: Ron Seely Science reporter

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/researchers-give-broader-meaning-biodiversity-uw/docview/391108852/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: For example, [Anthony Ives] said, in a lake damaged by acid rain, the real value of biodiversity might not necessarily just be the numbers of algae species in the lake. Instead, he said, it could be the presence or absence of a species that survives acidification of the lake. By protecting the biodiversity of the lake's algae population, you increase the chances of at least one species surviving, Ives said, so encouraging biodiversity remains crucial.

Full text: Quick, define "biodiversity."
Yes, it's one of those words we see all the time, one of those words that seems to roll off the tongue of just about every environmentalist as easily as a quote from Thoreau.
But what, really, is important about biodiversity?
Writing today in the journal Science, a group of UW-Madison scientists has enlarged upon our understanding of biodiversity.
Most of us think of biodiversity as referring simply to the number and variety of living things in a particular place. We think of rain forests, for example, or ocean reefs as being incredible repositories of biodiversity.
But these UW-Madison researchers have expanded upon that theme. Using a complicated mathematical model, they showed that it's not just brute numbers of species that are important. They found that an equally important component of biodiversity is the ability of a particular species within that diverse population to survive tough times.
"What's ultimately important," said Anthony Ives, a UW-Madison associate professor of zoology and the lead author of the study, "is whether you have some species that are tolerant."
Ives worked with Kevin Gross and Jennifer Klug, both co-authors of today's article and UW-Madison graduate students, to fine-tune the mathematical model that was the basis for the findings.
That model, which Ives described as "a formalized mathematical description of a general eco-system," allowed the researchers to study the changes various populations of organisms underwent when placed under environmental stress. Gross compared the model to an analysis of the stock market which looks at the ups and downs of various stocks over time. This model, however, looked at species populations and how they fared when stressed.
In real life, Ives said, those stresses could be everything from climate change to acid rain.
For example, Ives said, in a lake damaged by acid rain, the real value of biodiversity might not necessarily just be the numbers of algae species in the lake. Instead, he said, it could be the presence or absence of a species that survives acidification of the lake.
"If you have a lot of species that are all essentially identical, having more of them doesn't help at all," Ives said.
But by protecting the biodiversity of the lake's algae population, you increase the chances of at least one species surviving, Ives said, so encouraging biodiversity remains crucial.
"This furthers the idea that biodiversity does serve as an insurance policy," Ives said. "When in doubt . . . you're really prudent to hang on to everything."

Full text: The Confederation of British Industry will today attack the chancellor's energy tax plans, which have caused the biggest row between government and business since Labour took office.[QQ]
The industrialists will tell Gordon Brown that he must rethink the climate change levy if it is to achieve the objective of cutting pollution and avoid damaging British business.[QQ]
Peter Agar, the CBI deputy director-general, said the tax on industrial energy was `fundamentally flawed' and would hit businesses of all types and sizes.[QQ]
`Besides being potentially damaging to business, the tax is poorly designed to cut carbon emissions - the very thing it is supposed to do,' he said.[QQ]
The CBI makes its pleas in a special submission to the chancellor, separate from its main comments ahead of the budget report next month.[QQ]
The tax was published by the chancellor in this year's budget, but will not take effect until 2001. It is based on recommendations from a special inquiry under British Airways chairman Lord Marshall. But despite the lengthy consultation and a plan to refund all the money raised through lower national insurance charges, industrialists remain adamant that it will be disastrous for business.[QQ]
In today's letter to the chan cellor, the CBI says it supports international efforts to cut pollution but suggests the energy tax has been designed more to cut labour costs through the national insurance reduction.[QQ]
The business leaders call for six key changes, which they want the chancellor to flag in his pre-budget statement next month. The most significant is to reduce the pounds 1.75bn target the tax is intended to raise.[QQ]
The CBI wants such high-energy industries to be exempted from as much as 95% of the tax, much more than the government's intended 50% discount.[QQ]
Industry also wants Mr Brown to put more money into promoting energy efficiency, use the tax to boost renewable energy sources such as wind and sun, and pay greater attention to emissions trading.[QQ]
A pilot system for trading pollution permits is due to be launched later this month, but critics say this will allow industry to escape controls on emissions, while the government believes this is a longer- term solution which cannot be introduced quickly.[QQ]
Despite the intense anger in industry over the climate change levy, and the threat to the government's business-friendly image, ministers are not expected to be swayed by the CBI's pleas. Mr Brown is likely to announce minor concessions next month but is thought unlikely to accept significant alterations to the structure and implementation of the tax. [QQ]

Full text: Excerpts of the Throne Speech delivered in Parliament yesterday by Governor-General Adrienne Clarkson .....
CHILDREN AND YOUTH: OUR LEADERS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
Because of the changing nature of the world economy, the prospects for a high quality of life in any country will depend -- as never before -- on having a population that is adaptable, resilient and ready to learn throughout life. The foundation for this is laid in the very early years. No commitment we make today will be more important for the long-term prosperity and well-being of our society than the commitment to invest our efforts in very young children. Parents and families have the primary responsibility for the care of their children. But all of society must work together to ensure that our children develop the abilities to succeed.
The Government will extend and make more accessible Employment Insurance benefits for parental leave, to help parents take more time from work to spend with their children ... Through further tax relief, it will put more dollars in the hands of families with children. And ... it will work to reform family law and strengthen supports provided to families to ensure that, in cases of separation or divorce, the needs and best interests of children come first.
Federal, provincial and territorial governments are developing together the National Children's Agenda. As part of this work, it is the Government's objective to reach an agreement among governments by December 2000 on a national action plan to further support parents and families.
... To make it easier for families to break the cycle of poverty, the federal, provincial and territorial governments also established the National Child Benefit. The Government of Canada is already investing an additional $1.7 billion annually in low-income families with children, while the provinces and territories are investing in complementary services. ... by 2002, the Government will make a third significant investment in the National Child Benefit...
YOUNG CANADIANS
... The Government will:
- draw on the expertise of young Canadians to help connect rural and urban communities to the information highway, by hiring them to put in place additional Internet access sites for public use;
- create a single-window service -- Exchanges Canada -- to give 100,000 young Canadians every year the chance to learn about another part of the country;
- ensure that younger Canadians -- from age 13 -- are given an opportunity to apply their creative abilities, by providing them with a chance to produce their "first works" using traditional approaches and new technologies in the arts, cultural, digital and other industries;
- actively engage tens of thousands of young Canadian volunteers to participate in community and national environmental projects and to help others improve their literacy skills; and
- enable young Canadians to apply their energy and talents overseas, by participating in international internship programs and helping developing countries get connected to the Internet ....
A DYNAMIC ECONOMY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
In the global, knowledge-based economy, the advantage goes to countries that are innovative, have high levels of productivity, quickly adopt the latest technology, invest in skills development for their citizens, and seek out new opportunities around the world.
... The Government will continue to build a better environment for economic growth and enhanced productivity by reducing the debt burden, cutting taxes, and making strategic investments. Such investments will help small businesses grow, encourage trade, support citizens in developing the skills they need, and ensure that Canada has modern infrastructure.
The Government is committed to prudent fiscal management. It will never let the nation's finances get out of control again. It will keep the ratio of debt to GDP on a permanent downward track. It will deliver on the commitment it made at the beginning of this Parliament to devote half the budget surplus to debt repayment and tax relief, and the other half to investments that address the social and economic needs of Canadians.
... As the nation's finances have improved, the Government has begun to deliver broad-based tax relief -- totalling $16.5 billion over three years. As the nation's finances continue to improve, the Government will further reduce taxes to increase the disposable income of Canadians, enhance innovation and risk taking, and create a more robust economy ...
In its next budget, the Government will set out a multi-year plan for further tax reduction.
INCREASED TRADE AND INVESTMENT
... To build on Canada's advantage, the Government will increase its trade promotion in strategic sectors with high export potential - - sectors ranging from biotechnology and environmental and information technology to tourism, culture and health. It will also continue to support innovation and the development of new technologies in leading export sectors such as agriculture, agri- food and natural resources.
It will launch Investment Team Canada -- a co-ordinated effort by all governments and the private sector to make the international community more aware of the unique opportunities for investment and growth in Canada. The Government will also modernize legislation to make it easier for global corporations to locate their headquarters in Canada ...
SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
A skilled workforce and a capacity to innovate continuously are crucial building blocks of a successful 21st century economy ...
Over the next two years, the Government will work with its partners to:
- enable skills development to keep pace with the evolving economy. This work will be led by the Sectoral Councils, which bring together representatives from business, labour, education and other professional groups to address human resource issues in important areas of the Canadian economy;
- make it easier for Canadians to finance lifelong learning; and
- provide a single window to Canada-wide information about labour markets, skills requirements and training opportunities -- on the Internet, over the telephone or in person in communities across the country.
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
For Canada to generate jobs, growth and wealth, it must have a leading, knowledge-based economy that creates new ideas and puts them to work for Canadians. To do this, it is essential to connect Canadians to each other, to schools and libraries, to governments, and to the marketplace -- so they can build on each other's ideas and share information. Achieving this objective will require new types of infrastructure.
... The Government will introduce the legislation necessary to create the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. These institutes will provide a model for world-leading research, bringing together for the first time all the researchers who have an impact on health to undertake shared research priorities.
...The Government will:
- increase its support to the Granting Councils, enabling them to forge new partnerships with our universities to attract the best research minds in the world through an innovative program of 21st Century Chairs for Research Excellence;
- foster greater international research collaboration by Canadian universities and institutes and expand Canadian expertise in such areas as genomics, climate change, and advanced engineering; and
- find new markets for new products and services ...
PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
... The Government will work with other levels of government and the private sector to reach -- by the end of the year 2000 -- agreement on a five-year plan for improving physical infrastructure in urban and rural regions across the country. This agreement will set out shared principles, objectives and fiscal parameters for all partners to increase their resources directed toward infrastructure. It will focus on areas such as transport, tourism, telecommunications, culture, health and safety, and the environment.
HEALTH AND QUALITY CARE FOR CANADIANS
... The Government will continue to move forward with its provincial and territorial partners and the health care community on common priorities.
With its partners, the Government will support the testing of innovations in integrated service delivery in areas such as home care and pharmacare, working toward a health system in which all parts operate seamlessly.
THE QUALITY OF OUR ENVIRONMENT
.... The Government will introduce legislation and stewardship programs, working with provinces and territories to ensure that species at risk and their critical natural habitat are protected. The Government will also continue to extend Canada's national parks system.
In its own operations, the Government will make itself a model of environmental excellence. It will do more to clean up contaminated federal sites. It will strengthen its capacity for conducting environmental science research. It will also explore new environmental clean-up technologies.
PROMOTING SAFER COMMUNITIES
... The Government will combat drug trafficking while helping communities aid those most affected. It will also launch a program of restorative justice to help victims overcome the trauma of crime and provide non-violent offenders with a chance to help repair the damage caused by their actions.
... The Government of Canada will also continue to work closely with the Government of the United States to modernize our shared border for the 21st century.

Leaders: Labour's blind spot Be progressive, include the environment

Abstract: Amidst the New Labour triumphalism, there is one yawning gap which makes a mockery of all Mr Blair's claims to being a progressive: the environment. This is New Labour's blind spot. It is where all its optimistic rhetoric about the key words such as modernisation, radical, change and the future , begins to unravel. Modernisation has to include an environmental agenda: otherwise promising a rosy future is culpable fantasy-mongering. Nor can Mr Blair plead ignorance; the United Nations Environment Programme's predictions for the 21st century (the GEO-2000 report) was published just before the conference season. It laid out what is the most serious political challenge facing the globe. Yet it was barely mentioned in Bournemouth; Mr Blair seems to think he can fob the environmentalists off with a fox hunting ban.[QQ]

Full text: Amidst the New Labour triumphalism, there is one yawning gap which makes a mockery of all Mr Blair's claims to being a progressive: the environment. This is New Labour's blind spot. It is where all its optimistic rhetoric about the key words such as modernisation, radical, change and the future , begins to unravel. Modernisation has to include an environmental agenda: otherwise promising a rosy future is culpable fantasy-mongering. Nor can Mr Blair plead ignorance; the United Nations Environment Programme's predictions for the 21st century (the GEO-2000 report) was published just before the conference season. It laid out what is the most serious political challenge facing the globe. Yet it was barely mentioned in Bournemouth; Mr Blair seems to think he can fob the environmentalists off with a fox hunting ban.[QQ]
There are three issues over which the government can prove - or lose - its environmental credentials before the next election and all of them are pressing in the next few weeks. Firstly, New Labour's most important manifesto commitment on the environment was a 20% cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010. It was a bold target exceeding that agreed in Kyoto, and it delighted environmentalists because it upped the stakes globally, increasing pressure on the US. But what was once a clear commitment has slipped into cautious aspirational language after pressure from the treasury and the department of trade and industry. Environmentalists are outraged and are gearing up for a major campaign. A key point comes later this month at a climate convention in Bonn where the fear is that UK backsliding , once seen as the global leader, will slow momentum.[QQ]
The second issue is the climate change levy proposed by Gordon Brown in his budget last March. The principle of shifting taxation from employment (cuts in national insurance) to pollution was laudatory. But energy-intensive industries are currently waging a vociferous lobbying campaign, threatening dire consequences for British competitiveness, to get generous exemptions; the danger is the policy ends up like Emmenthal cheese, riddled with holes. Thirdly, whether a wildlife bill gets into the Queen's Speech next month is hanging in the balance; if it fails there is a chance the government could go into the next election without a piece of specific environmental legislation to its name. There is widespread agreement that existing legislation protecting wildlife is not strong enough, the question is whether the government will prioritise it for parliamentary time.[QQ]
The truth is that New Labour has never been interested in the environmental agenda as a Fabian pamphlet published this week points out. It regarded it as being anti-business, and feared a collision with Middle England's love of cars and consumerism. The matter has been left to drift; environmentalists describe an alarming degree of ignorance and indifference in Number Ten. But Mr Blair should learn his lesson from the clobbering he got over genetically modified organisms. If he does not, he risks giving ground to Charles Kennedy who has already spotted his weakness; nor is it beyond the realms of reason for the Tories to capitalise on their record under John Gummer and snatch an environmental agenda from under New Labour's nose. The next few weeks are crucial; there is still time for New Labour to remedy its mistake. Mr Blair needs to get to grips fast with the fact that the environment is a crucial part of being progressive not an optional extra. [QQ]

Abstract: Insisting that his comments were misinterpreted, [David Anderson] said he has no intention of bringing to the cabinet a proposal that would increase taxes on other gas-guzzlers. "I don't propose to target drivers of sport-utility vehicles," he told reporters. He also repeated his vow not to support the introduction of a carbon tax - a tax on fuel consumption. After a speech Thursday, Anderson suggested in vague terms that SUVs might face new taxes designed to discourage their popularity as part of the effort to control greenhouse-gas emissions. American research shows the average SUV produces about one-third more carbon dioxide - a major greenhouse gas - per kilometre than the average passenger car. In Canada, sport-utility vehicles face the same fuel-efficiency standards as light trucks, requiring them to achieve a minimum fuel efficiency level of 11.4 litres per 100 kilometres. Passenger cars must meet a standard of 8.6 litres per 100 kilometres.

Full text:   Environment Minister David Anderson tried to put the brakes on a furor that erupted yesterday after he warned that a tax on sport- utility vehicles might someday be needed to address climate change.
The comments sent shivers through the auto industry and unleashed a barrage of criticism from motorist and family groups who accused Anderson of attacking their beloved SUVs.
The rookie environment minister, who has quickly earned a reputation for his tough-minded approach to issues, called a late- day press conference yesterday to pour cold water on the suggestion that he favoured a tax on gas-guzzling vehicles.
Insisting that his comments were misinterpreted, Anderson said he has no intention of bringing to the cabinet a proposal that would increase taxes on other gas-guzzlers. "I don't propose to target drivers of sport-utility vehicles," he told reporters. He also repeated his vow not to support the introduction of a carbon tax - a tax on fuel consumption.
In Vague Terms
After a speech Thursday, Anderson suggested in vague terms that SUVs might face new taxes designed to discourage their popularity as part of the effort to control greenhouse-gas emissions. American research shows the average SUV produces about one-third more carbon dioxide - a major greenhouse gas - per kilometre than the average passenger car.
A transcript of the interview shows Anderson heavily qualified his comments and gave no indication that such a tax proposal was now on the table.
Still, the minister clearly miscalculated public reaction to any attack on the popular SUVs, especially one that raised the spectre of more taxes.
Anderson's comments blindsided auto industry officials who accused the minister yesterday of "political wrecklessness."
"The minister seems to think, quite myopically, that if you address trucks and SUVs you're going to solve the problem but nothing could be farther from the truth," said Mark Nantais, director of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, which represents the country's major car builders.
The government's own transportation panel, charged with offering policy options to politicians, has recommended against the idea of a gas-guzzler tax, he said.
An Inefficient Way
The transportation panel concluded the tax would be an inefficient way to reduce greenhouse gases, costing between $400 and $500 per tonne of emissions. "The government really has to be a little more innovative about how they go about this otherwise they're going to restrict economic expansion," Nantais warned.
A gas-guzzler tax would be applied to the sticker price of a vehicle based on its fuel-efficiency rating. Ontario used to impose a similar tax based on engine size while Britain now has in place incentives to encourage the purchase of smaller cars.
In Canada, sport-utility vehicles face the same fuel-efficiency standards as light trucks, requiring them to achieve a minimum fuel efficiency level of 11.4 litres per 100 kilometres. Passenger cars must meet a standard of 8.6 litres per 100 kilometres.
The popularity of SUVs has skyrocketed in North America and they now make up about 25 per cent of new vehicle sales. Insurance companies have complained the vehicles are so heavy that even fender- benders they're involved in can be expensive to repair and rates may go up as a result.

Full text: OTTAWA -- Environment Minister David Anderson tried to put the brakes on a furor that erupted Friday after he warned that a tax on sport utility vehicles might someday be needed to address climate change.
The comments sent shivers through the auto industry and unleashed a barrage of criticism from motorist and family groups who accused Anderson of attacking their beloved SUVs.
The rookie environment minister, who has quickly earned a reputation for his tough-minded approach to issues, called a late- day news conference Friday to pour cold water on the suggestion that he favored a tax on gas guzzling vehicles.
Insisting his comments were misinterpreted, Anderson said he has no intention of bringing to cabinet a proposal that would increase taxes on SUVs or other gas guzzlers.
"I don't propose to target drivers of sport utility vehicles," he told reporters.
CARBON TAX
He also repeated his vow not to support the introduction of a carbon tax -- a tax on fuel consumption.
After a speech Thursday, Anderson suggested in vague terms that SUVs may face new taxes designed to discourage their popularity as part of the effort to control greenhouse gas emissions.
American research shows the average SUV produces about one third more carbon dioxide -- a major greenhouse gas --per kilometre than the average passenger car.
A transcript of the interview shows Anderson heavily qualified his comments and gave no indication that such a tax proposal was now on the table.
Still, the minister clearly miscalculated public reaction to any attack on the popular SUVs, especially one that raised the spectre of more taxes.
Anderson's comments blindsided auto industry officials who accused the minister Friday of "political wrecklessness."
"The minister seems to think, quite myopically, that if you address trucks and SUVs you're going to solve the problem but nothing could be farther from the truth," said Mark Nantais, director of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, which represents the country's major car builders.
The government's own transportation panel, charged with offering policy options to politicians, has recommended against the idea of a gas guzzler tax, he said.
The transportation panel concluded the tax would be an inefficient way to reduce greenhouse gases, costing between $400 and $500 per tonne of emissions.
INNOVATION
"The government really has to be a little more innovative about how they go about this otherwise they're going to restrict economic expansion,"Nantais warned.
A gas guzzler tax would be applied to the sticker price of a vehicle based on its fuel efficiency rating. Ontario used to impose a similar tax based on engine size while Britain now has in place incentives to encourage the purchase of smaller cars.
In Canada, sport utility vehicles face the same fuel efficiency standards as light trucks, requiring them to achieve a minimum fuel efficiency level of 11.4 litres per 100 kilometres. Passenger cars must meet a standard of 8.6 litres per 100 kilometres.
The popularity of SUVs has skyrocketed in North America and they now make up about 25 per cent of new vehicle sales. Insurance companies have complained the vehicles are so heavy that even fender benders they're involved in can be expensive to repair and rates may go up as a result.
Judy Ciufo, government affairs manager for the Canadian Automobile Association, said motorists already pay enough taxes.

Environmentalists, meanwhile, welcomed a tax on SUVs and other gas guzzlers as "long overdue." Gerry Scott, climate change campaign director for the David Suzuki Foundation, said a gas guzzler tax could be revenue-neutral with money generated used to subsidize the purchase of fuel-efficient vehicles.
The trend since 1984 toward heavier, more powerful vehicles has offset most of the environmental benefits realized from improved car emissions technology.
With more and larger vehicles on the road, the fuel efficiency of an average vehicle today is only marginally better than what it was in the mid-1980's.

With more and larger vehicles on the road, the fuel efficiency of an average vehicle today is only marginally better than what it was in the mid-1980's.
Anderson, since taking over the environment portfolio in August, has made it known within the department that he intends to forge a green legacy for the Liberal government. He has already vowed to introduce strong legislation to protect endangered species that invokes the government's criminal law power to protect crucial habitat.
And on the long-stalled federal climate change strategy, Anderson has expressed his frustration at the lack of action and has made it clear he will impose government solutions if voluntary reductions are not stepped up.
As part of an international treaty, Canada agreed in Kyoto, Japan to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.
Since most of Canada's greenhouse emissions come from the burning of coal, oil and gasoline, it means reaching the target will require a major shift in energy production and use.
