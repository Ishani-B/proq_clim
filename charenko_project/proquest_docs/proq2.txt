Full text: Global warming/ Berlin summit
INSIDE the vast International Congress Centre building, the pressure groups were in their element. At most international conferences, critics of the establishment play little more than a walk-on role. Like ticks on an elephant's back, their bites have little obvious effect. In Berlin last week, things were different - a sign, perhaps, of things to come.
At the UN conference on climate change - in effect, the "How to Stop Global Warming" conference - environmental pressure groups played a key role in defining the agenda.
There was a sprinkling of truly exotic delegates - like the little group who kept jumping up at press conferences and warning of the coming judgement of the Lord. There were the familiar brand of summit theatricals, too, who organised telegenic stunts outside the conference building, and who invaded the plenary hall.
But it was the mainstream environmental groups among the non-governmental organisations, or NGOs, who set the tone. They received fulsome tribute when yesterday's document was adopted.
The NGOs were everywhere in the giant, energy-guzzling halls. Their representatives even outnumbered the government delegates. The German government had even invited representatives of environmental NGOs to form part of the official delegation. The NGOs, worried about losing their credibility, said no.
Not that the green lobby regarded the results of the conference as a success. The conference was widely written off as a disaster before it began. And it was written off as a disaster after it was over. "A historic missed opportunity," in one environmentalist's phrase. In short: another talking shop, which got nowhere.
But the jury is still out as to whether Berlin really got nowhere - or whether it will be seen as a milestone in years to come. The critics point out that the conference did not even attempt to reach an agreement on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases - which is, after all, the point. What the conference did do, too, can be seen as puny. It decreed that proposals should be prepared for reduction targets which will be agreed (or not) in 1997. Nothing, in other words, which commits anybody to do anything. What could be measlier?
But such an analysis may leave out a crucial element: the likely pressures, partly created by the Berlin conference, in the next two years. Sometimes hot air (to coin a phrase) can just be hot air. Thus, it was a depressing experience to witness western governments congratulating one another on their "diplomatic triumph" after a huge international conference on Yugoslavia in 1992. The parallels with Berlin are clear: a set of highfalutin declarations which get nowhere and which, by failing to tackle the real issues, pave the way for the ultimate catastrophe.
Representatives of the Alliance of Small Island States, who were active in Berlin, are worried. The very existence of some islands is threatened if global warming continues because of the associated rise in sea level. For them, every delay seems to be playing with disaster. Others, too, are beginning to get worried - though sometimes with more ambivalent feelings. China's size and industrial growth means that its carbon dioxide emissions are, in absolute terms, great - though much smaller, per capita, then in the West. And yet China is also afraid of the implications of global warming of potentially destructive storms or damage to coastal areas. In this respect, China has found an ally in populous India, which has the same ambivalence.
The two-year delay is intended to give an opportunity to work out how reductions will be carried out, and who will carry the burden. That may be dull - but not necessarily useless. In the long term, this process may prove more significant than the razzmatazz pledges made at the earth summit in Rio in 1992.
From now on, whenever major floods or hurricanes occur (insurance companies warned last week that they fear an American hurricane which could cost $50bn), television news is likely to mention global warming as a possible cause. That, in turn, will make voters more aware. Voters' awareness will put pressure on the politicians. And political pressures will make global warming more of a "sexy" issue for the editors of television news. Thus, the circle closes, and the concerns seem likely to spiral.
Of course, the politicians could go back on their commitments. But would the voters accept such an obvious lack of good faith? It was, in any case, interesting to note how many delegates in Berlin seemed almost to hope that they would one day be forced to seize the nettle.
Already, there is what Michael Zammit Cutajar, the UN official with responsibility for the new secretariat devoted to global warming, calls the creation of "a level playing field" between north and south.
"Before, it was always developing countries which were on the mat. Now, it's the other way round. The developed countries are under scrutiny. That's a good thing." these (above) in Shenyang, China, will still belch out greenhouse gases. Chinese factory workers (right) take a cigarette break PHOTOGRAPHS: TOM STODDART/KATZ

You don't have to be a ``panicked'' Green activist to recognize the signs of political hypocrisy and economic coverup in the disarray in Berlin over the first review of the Climate Change Convention, one of the few successes of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. But there was Sheila Copps, minister of our so-called environment ministry, telling The Ottawa Citizen how sad it was that Canadians were less interested in the environment as she flew off to Berlin to stand with the Americans against firm reduction targets.

Full text: That environmental charade in Berlin might be the basis for a satirical film were it not about something that could be less than amusing, the planet's future.
The Economist, in its usual unctuous editorial voice, reassured penguins and people that there was no need to panic if the UN conference on global warming accomplished little in Berlin, because earthly catastrophe was not visible ahead. ``There is still time to bask in the sun.''
That is like telling 40,000 Newfoundland fishermen five years ago fish all you like, the cod will always be there.
You don't have to be a ``panicked'' Green activist to recognize the signs of political hypocrisy and economic coverup in the disarray in Berlin over the first review of the Climate Change Convention, one of the few successes of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
But there was Sheila Copps, minister of our so-called environment ministry, telling The Ottawa Citizen how sad it was that Canadians were less interested in the environment as she flew off to Berlin to stand with the Americans against firm reduction targets.
Those are the Americans who are so eager to get Brazil to stop burning the rainforest, but emit more ``greenhouse'' gases than any other country in the world. Canada is second. And the U.S. has done less to meet the modest target set at Rio of stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.
In Berlin, there was the heartwarming sight of insurance company executives rushing around like tree-huggers urging their fellow capitalists to please reduce those greenhouse gases because we can't afford more California flood claims since El Nino distorted the weather patterns.
There were the guys from those oil and coal corporations, whose annual reports now feature how they love the environment, button-holing delegates to remind them how costly it will be to eliminate those gases or to encourage alternate fuels. While the top gaseous producing countries -- the U.S., Canada, Australia and Japan - fought for the soft and flabby target, Middle Eastern oil-producing states fought for the veto on any change at all.
And the emerging economic giants, China and India, whose energy needs depend largely on coal, urged their fellow Third World developing nations to support tougher targets for the polluters so they can break into the new industrial world at last.
Nobody, however, was listening to the poor island states of the Pacific, the Caribbean or the Indian Ocean which could be flooded or drowned if global warming melts the ice caps and raises the oceans as scientists predict for the next century.
Of course, nobody knows for sure whether this will happen, any more than fish experts know whether the turbot or the salmon will come back. But it ill behooves any of us to avoid dealing collectively with these serious global environmental problems and not merely with platitudinous words rather than achievable actions.
The European Community has been pushing for tougher reduction targets than the U.S. or Canada want to accept. But all of the rich industrialized countries in Berlin have been pointing the finger at the poor Third World countries for doing little or nothing to reach the modest Rio targets.
Yet these countries that have polluted the atmosphere most are the very countries that have exhausted the earth's resources in enriching themselves and whose commercialization of the world's economies has driven Third World countries to deplete their forests and desertify their lands in the pursuit of modernization and wealth.
This does not mean the industrialized West must wear a hair shirt and chant mea culpas. But it should mean their governments ought morally to give serious leadership to activating the Climate Change Convention, rather than hamstringing it.
Tough economic times these may be, though they are much worse outside the rich West. If our governments will be honest with us about the planet's environmental problems, the people will be interested and support needed change. But we can't just bask in the sun, especially when those ozone holes keep growing.

Abstract: SAN FRANCISCO Invisibly small, the flecks of volcanic dust have been wafting through our atmosphere for nearly four years now. Ejected by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991, the ash dispersed around the planet like a fine mist, shielding the earth's surface from the full force of the sun.

Full text: THE EDITORIAL PAGE; Today's debate: GLOBAL WARMING; OUR VIEW: We've already taken some baby steps. Now the nation should take the lead in thinking globally.
At the start of a two-week, 160-nation conference on global warming now in progress in Berlin, a high-wire artist lost his footing, grabbed the cable and barely saved himself from plummeting 160 feet. The moment provides a useful metaphor for the current state of international action to curb global warming. Like the tightrope walker, it's barely hanging on.
Although everyone admits the science is imperfect, evidence of global warming and surveys of its costs continue to mount.
A World Bank report suggests that by 2050, sea levels could inundate Shanghai, flood almost 35,000 square miles and displace 76 million people. The Institute for International Economics estimates a 5 degree rise in world temperatures would cost the United States $45 billion a year due to drought, rising sea levels and so forth.
Can all this be linked to the billions of tons of greenhouse gases -- mainly carbon dioxide -- we generate each year? No one knows for certain, but in the last 100 years, while CO levels have risen 20%, average temperatures have risen by 1 degree - a full one-third of the world's total temperature rise over the last 10,000 years.
The risk of even greater change, perhaps 6 degrees or more, is why industrialized nations agreed in 1992 to cap their production of greenhouse gases at 1990 levels. Few nations, though, are even close. The United States, like many other nations, merely is encouraging CO producers to cut back.
Opponents say there's no rush to limit emissions, and cutting greenhouse gases will hurt the economy without benefit.
But climate change is not a steady progression. It can jerk and spike with horrific results. This is why the world's insurance industry is re-examining the way it handles storm and flood coverage.
Moreover, you can limit pollution without imposing an undue economic burden.
Since 1990, companies that produce sulfur dioxide -- an acid rain precursor -- have been able to buy and sell pollution rights. Significantly, the cost of those rights has stayed unexpectedly low. Lesson: With market-based incentives and appropriate flexibility, polluters can and will find cost-effective ways to cut SO emissions.
Why not do the same for CO? And because global warming is a global threat, why not create a global market?
In Berlin, where the climate change conference ends Friday, many developing nations hate this idea, which they fear will slow their economic development. They want, first, to see hard new commitments by the industrialized world.
Congress and the White House can answer that demand with tradable CO permits. This would show our resolve, provide a model for similar efforts elsewhere and cut other major air pollutants at home. That's a smart play even if you think global warming is a crock.

Too hot to handle In the week when global warming was at the top of the world's agenda, newspapers chose to cast their eyes elsewhere

Author: Russel-Jones, Robin

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/too-hot-handle-week-when-global-warming-was-at/docview/294862486/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: LAST week the international community met in Berlin to determine what further measures are needed to combat global warming. On Thursday it was announced that ozone depletion over the northern hemisphere has reached a record low due to high levels of chlorine monoxide and low temperatures in the stratosphere. These two issues are closely linked. They are both worsening atmospheric casualties of man's industrial activities, and they are both preventable. Indeed the CFCs that destroy ozone are also potent greenhouse gases.

Full text: LAST week the international community met in Berlin to determine what further measures are needed to combat global warming. On Thursday it was announced that ozone depletion over the northern hemisphere has reached a record low due to high levels of chlorine monoxide and low temperatures in the stratosphere. These two issues are closely linked. They are both worsening atmospheric casualties of man's industrial activities, and they are both preventable.
Indeed the CFCs that destroy ozone are also potent greenhouse gases. Warming of the lower atmosphere leads to cooling of the stratosphere, the formation of polar stratospheric clouds and accelerated ozone loss. To those who ask: "Which is the most important environmental issue?" They are both issues of critical importance to our society.
However society's response could not be more different. Whilst the causes and remedies for ozone depletion are widely recognised, there is an extraordinary reluctance to accept the implications of climate change.
Newspaper editors either ignore the issue altogether, or ask journalists such as Matt Ridley and Richard North who are making a career out of criticising the environmental movement and who write articles which seem unbelievably complacent about the effects of global warming.
The Daily Express, Daily Mail, Daily Mirror and the Today newspaper carried no coverage whatsoever. Only a brief mention appeared in the Daily Telegraph and nothing in the Times. However the Times had published a scientifically confused article by Matt Ridley (March 25), and a further piece on March 27 which cast doubt on the reliability of temperature measurements! The Independent had also published a fatuous article by its economic correspondent stating that the solution to global warming was to ignore it, get rich and then pay for the consequences. At least the Independent allowed the chairman of Friends of the Earth to reply (March 29).
Only the Guardian and the Financial Times demonstrated a coherent policy towards the issue. Several articles appeared in both papers, but perhaps the most surprising was an FT piece on the response of insurance companies to climate change (March 31). The world's six largest storm catastrophes between 1987 and 1993 cost the insurance sector $36 billion in compensation. By setting premiums according to customer's environmental record, the insurance companies hope to influence industrial practice in a way that governments seem unwilling to do. A further article on this theme appeared in the Sunday Telegraph: "Banks catch a chill on global warming". How revealing that the most conservative of institutions should be the ones to take global warming seriously.
During the four days that five newspapers could not find space for any mention of global warming or ozone depletion, those same papers devoted 163 pages to sport and an incredible 19 pages to the funeral of Ronnie Kray. Do people think that the burial of a malevolent old gangster from the East End is of greater importance than the integrity of the ecosystems that sustain life on this planet?

Abstract: Benazir Bhutto, Prime Minister of Pakistan, has criticized the United States and the West for having trained warriors to fight the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the name of Islamic holy war, and then having withdrawn hastily when the Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan ("Two Shootings in Karachi," March 22). The same Ms. Bhutto and other Pakistanis have repeatedly criticized the regime of Mohammed Zia ul-Haq for having sought American help during the Afghan war. Now Bhutto, only a few days after her criticism of the American policy of arming the so-called Muslim militants during the Afghan war, turns to the Americans and pleads with them "to carry out the entire cleansing operation" in Pakistan. Here is the prime minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, who took a solemn oath when she became prime minister to promote the Islamic ideology in Pakistan, pleading with the Americans to help her deal with the problem of Islamic militancy.

As a democratic leader with the support of the Pakistan People's Party behind her, is it not her duty to use the party as a means to bring about constructive change among her people so that they focus their energies on community-building projects instead of indulging in senseless sectarian killings?

It's demographic change, not climatic
The article "Insurance Firms Ask If Global Warming Swells Disaster Rate," March 29, suggests that climatic change is the primary culprit in the escalating insurance losses associated with hurricanes. The primary cause, however, of multibillion dollar losses is not a change of climate, but a change of demography. Hurricane Andrew, which devastated southern Dade County, Fla., in 1992, was the most expensive hurricane to strike the United States (though not the most deadly). The $17 billion of insured losses had nothing to do with climate change, but everything to do with the urban development in Dade County.
The insurance industry should look at its business practices, as opposed to focusing on the academic scientific discussion of climate change. Although industry representatives may be tempted to resign themselves to the thesis of global warming, they will save their institutions' money only by coming to terms with the overdevelopment and overinsurance of dangerous coastal properties.

The article fails to mention another important reason for the increase in severity of recent disasters. As the article points out, 21 out of the 25 largest catastrophes in the United States, in insured terms, have occurred in the last decade. What is missed is that our own human population is also exploding at an unprecedented rate. This has myriad effects that increase the severity of a natural disaster, from simple increases in population densities to building on land once considered unsuitable for habitation. The continued loss and destruction of our natural environment only exacerbates this trend when we replace it by acres of man-made structures.
Besides the obvious connection with an increase in global warming, the population explosion ensures that when natural disasters do occur, they will continue to be the most costly, deadly disasters.

Full text: FACADE: Since it was set up in the early 1970s to bring environmental protection -- air, water, wildlife, toxic chemicals and the rest -- under one roof, Environment Canada has failed to protect the country's environment.
Who needs Environment Canada?
The troubled department recently responded to major federal budget cuts by doing what it does best: Giving more work to the provinces, and admitting it will have trouble doing what's left.
The federal department has little influence on anything you eat, drink or breathe. And it doesn't enforce its own laws. Now it proposes reducing its role further, shifting more responsibilities to the provinces, private businesses and universities.
Its plans to deal with endangered species offers an example of this shrinking role. Environment Canada still wants to stop international smuggling of endangered animals, publish studies and help provinces discuss the issues. But it will do less to protect rare plants and animals in Canada.
The dwindling effectiveness of Environment Canada raises a question: Should it be allowed to retain its departmental status as it fades into irrelevance? Or should it be broken into little chunks that other departments -- which have already taken over most of Environment Canada's role anyway -- could salvage?
``Somebody will soon have to ask, Why do you want Environment Canada to exist at all?'' said Paul Muldoon, a prominent environmental lawyer. The key is its shrinking role and growing reluctance to regulate industries, he said.
Since it was set up in the early 1970s to bring environmental protection (air, water, wildlife, toxic chemicals and the rest) under one roof, Environment Canada has steadily lost clout and the will to protect the country's environment. It has never replaced the provinces as the main protector of the physical area we call Canada.
It looks solid enough on the outside, but on closer inspection it looks like the building facade from a movie set.
Its legacy for Canada is haphazard environmental protection under a ragged patchwork of provincial environment regimes.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is much stronger. It has assigned states the duty of cleaning the air in polluted areas, with an ultimatum: Make progress or lose federal grants for building roads. It can also issue orders to cities.
The crucial U.S. law is the federal Clean Air Act, which lays out air quality standards for the country. There's no such law in Canada.
And if U.S. citizens think the EPA is shirking, they can, and sometimes do, sue -- not for money, but for a court order forcing the EPA to follow the law to the letter. Individual Canadians don't have such extensive rights.
In Canada, the provinces are the real environmental cops. But the patchwork of environmental laws differ -- and sometimes conflict -- from province to province.
For instance, Ontario law says towns and cities must treat their sewage. Quebec has no such law, which means people on opposite banks of the Ottawa River live by very different rules.
Another example: Alberta has outlawed the sale of gall bladders taken from bears. Demand for the gall bladders, which are used in traditional Oriental medicines, has stimulated poaching and threatens bear populations in many parts of Canada.
``But it's legal to trade in bear gall bladders in Saskatchewan, which is right next door (to Alberta),'' said Judy Levita of the World Wildlife Fund. ``So you get people poaching bears in Alberta and taking the gall bladders across the (Saskatchewan) border to sell.''
Closer to home, Quebec has banned the sale of a tiny endangered plant, the wild leek. But the edible plant, which looks a little like a baby onion, can be legally picked and sold in Ontario. It's not endangered here. Officials believe many of the wild leeks sold in Ottawa each summer come illegally from Quebec.
And environmental taxes, soft drink deposits, garbage dumping fees and other economic measures vary widely from province to province.
Budget night brought the issue into sharp focus.
Canada's usually vocal environmental activists remained silent as federal cuts wiped out 1,400 of 5,700 Environment Canada jobs, and slashed the department's financing to $503 million from $737 million.
More than that, they complimented the Liberal government on a budget that would help the environment by giving fewer subsidies to energy megaprojects.
Their lack of concern over such drastic cuts is the most obvious evidence the department matters less and less.
There's certainly a role for a single national body that provides an overview for Canada. That's what the department was supposed to do since 1971, when the federal government announced plans to create Environment Canada. (The promise of the day was to ``put ecology ahead of economics whenever a choice has to be made between the two.'')
At the very least, Canada needs a body to do research on national and global issues, and to run a national wildlife service. And we need someone to represent us internationally because pollution knows no boundaries. We keep signing international agreements -- on protecting plant and animal species, on acid rain, on climate change, on the thinning ozone layer. Once signed, they need enforcement at home.
But anyone who honestly believes Environment Canada fills a national leadership role also believes those no-name strikebreakers playing baseball in Florida are real Montreal Expos and real Toronto Blue Jays.
Yet the image that Environment Canada is the main environmental agency in this country persists with the public. If we have 5,700 people (for now) under the Environment Canada banner, doesn't that mean it's the national leader in making this country a better place to live?
No.
The air you breathe is one example of Environment Canada's irrelevance.
Air pollutants have become almost the exclusive territory of the provinces. British Columbia has ordered car owners to test tailpipe emissions once a year and get repairs if the engine is too dirty. Ontario may follow. But there's no nationwide rule.
What about the water?
Municipal governments handle the basic stuff, sewage and drinking water. Provinces regulate industrial waste water. Environment Canada shares responsibility for some waterways, such as the St. Lawrence River.
It likes to brag about the $3-million fine it won against an industry east of Montreal, but it doesn't tell people it watched the daily flushing of tonnes of pollutants into the river for 30 years before laying charges.
In the Great Lakes, which hold more than one-fifth of the world's fresh water, Environment Canada says it's still committed to spending $110 million on conservation and cleanups. But it will spread the spending over a longer period.
And it says it may not be able to achieve some of its targets because of the budget.
Which targets? Cleaning sites of major contamination, destroying PCBs, protecting wetlands and studying the impact of climate change in the ``basin'' of the lakes. Other target dates have been extended a year or two: cleaning tainted sediments, reducing toxic pollution, and protecting wildlife.
Remember, this is an international issue; our commitment to protect the lakes dates to a Canada-U.S. treaty signed in 1909.
Canada's weak environmental performance has prompted international criticism. By the early 1990s, at the height of the acid rain debate, U.S. regulators often pointed out that their country had 150 power plants equipped with ``scrubbers'' to clean acid gases out of their smoke, while Canada, for all its tree-hugging rhetoric, had none.
The department is earning a reputation for admitting it can't handle its job. Last fall, its scientists decided Environment Canada had neither the jurisdiction nor the scientific know-how to protect endangered species. It does a darn good job of placing the animals on a list. Beyond that, one hopes the dying beluga whales are impressed by arguments over jurisdiction.
On land, the provinces do most of the real work in regulating forestry: That's why British Columbia regulates forest protection to a greater extent than the neighboring Yukon, where forests are federally regulated.
And other federal departments do a huge proportion of environmental work.
Environment Canada doesn't even enforce its own laws. Last June's annual report was typical. In the previous 12 months, Environment Canada had caught 136 people or companies breaking environmental laws, and prosecuted just eight of them. The other 128 got off with warnings.
By contrast, Ontario prosecuted more than 400 environment cases last year, winning convictions in 345 of them, with a similar-sized enforcement staff.
``If you have no enforcement, you might as well have no regulations,'' says Heather Hamilton, head of the Canadian Biodiversity Network, a group dedicated to protecting the full range of plants and animals.
Just a few years ago, Environment Canada was claiming it had the toughest pollution law in the western world. It no longer makes that claim.
So what's left? Great scientific research. Environment Canada is a world leader in understanding our endangered ozone layer, global warming, the long-range drift of toxic chemicals, threats to wildlife, and a lot of other topics. If Environment Canada goes, someone must pick up the pieces.
But the department must be more than a research institute. Canadians keep telling pollsters they want someone in authority to be waving the green flag, while Environment Canada, anxious not to offend, bogs down in endless ``multistakeholder consultations.'' If it flies a flag at all, it's pure white.
Environment Minister Sheila Copps disagrees sharply with most of this assessment.
The fact environmental powers are spread over different jurisdictions ``is a plus, not a minus,'' she said in an interview, because it involves everyone in the decisions rather than leaving all the power to one department to wield ``in a command-and-control mode.''
And she said we need a central body that will represent us internationally. Canada's federal-provincial position on climate change, set for last week's conference in Berlin, may be imperfect, she said, but we would have far less if the provinces were left on their own.
``As weak as our position is, it certainly would be far weaker if we did not have a department that was pushing us forward.''
That much is certainly true. Provinces can't deal internationally, and Canada keeps signing international agreements. But Environment Canada doesn't fill this role very strongly, anyway.
Seven years after Canada hosted the granddaddy of climate change conferences (Our Changing Atmosphere in 1988), plans to reduce our output of ``greenhouse'' gases are still somewhere off in the future.
As David Runnalls of the Institute for Research on Public Policy says: ``Canada is good at signing all sorts of things that the federal government has no chance of enforcing,'' usually because, as with climate change and endangered species, the provinces have all the power that matters.
He favors keeping Environment Canada in some form, but adds that questioning its right to exist ``is a legitimate question'' because of its chronic weakness.
A second danger is that busting up the department would leave the valuable fragments such as its researchers as vassals without an overlord. They wouldn't last long under a cost-cutting government. One remedy might involve breaking them off into separate research institutes associated with universities, where they would be far safer from political censorship.
Abolishing the department would be admitting defeat to the world, admitting that we have little national will protecting the physical body that we call Canada. But it would be a starting point for building something better.
Environment Canada good and dead might achieve more than Environment Canada on life support.
Who's in control
Environmental responsibilities:
Local government: Sewage treatment, garbage disposal, recycling, composting, land use planning.
Provinces: Industrial pollutants (including major spills); standards for water and air quality, use of pesticides, most wildlife and freshwater fish protection, forestry; oversees local government's roles.
Other federal departments: Oversee forestry, mining, nuclear industry, national parks, ocean fisheries, health studies in Great Lakes, pesticide registration.
Environment Canada: Weather forecasting, science research, Canada's position under international agreements (such as climate change convention); shares responsibility with provinces on endangered species and regional issues such as Great Lakes and St. Lawrence; can set some national standards; recently said it will help different provinces ``harmonize'' their laws and regulations; environmental assessment of major projects on federal property (such as rivers).
Update
The issue: The greenhouse effect is the name given to the rise in the earth's average temperature since the industrial revolution. Scientists blame the increasing concentration of gases such as methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere for trapping heat.
What's new: Delegates from almost 130 nations are in Berlin this week for a 10-day United Nations conference on global warming. The meeting is the first follow-up to the 1992 Rio earth summit, where it was decided that countries should monitor greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide.
The evidence: Although the complexity of the earth's climate system makes it difficult to predict the consequences accurately, a catalogue of anecdotal evidence is growing.
The oceans: There has been unprecedented bleaching of corals in Tahiti, a feature linked to an increase in ocean temperatures. Some meteorologists believe freak weather patterns in recent years, including the floods that swamped Europe, are consistent with global warming.
Weather patterns: The global insurance industry has recorded a 40-fold rise in claims arising from hurricanes and other extreme weather over the past 25 years. The formation of an iceberg the size of Cyprus in the Antarctic last month is also consistent with warming.

Hot Politics of Global Warming; U.N. Debates Earth's Fate, Who's to Blame, What to Do: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: Delegates to the United Nations climate conference here want to know if humans have caused global warming. But first, humans being humans, the conference itself has gotten hot with politics. The profound climatic questions of the day have been largely overshadowed by procedural disputes, electoral wrangling and stem-winding oratory. Oil-producing nations, for example, remained adamant on day three of the 11-day, $16 million conference that any action plan for reducing "greenhouse gases" -- believed responsible for the Earth's increasing temperature -- should require unanimous rather than majority approval. That would permit any one of more than 120 participating nations to veto emission targets for the 21st century. As delegates worked behind closed doors to find a compromise, lobbyists -- particularly environmentalists and industry representatives -- worked to promote their contrary interpretations of the scientific data on global warming and thus two different views on the Earth's fate.

The profound climatic questions of the day have been largely overshadowed by procedural disputes, electoral wrangling and stem-winding oratory.
Oil-producing nations, for example, remained adamant on day three of the 11-day, $16 million conference that any action plan for reducing "greenhouse gases" -- believed responsible for the Earth's increasing temperature -- should require unanimous rather than majority approval. That would permit any one of more than 120 participating nations to veto emission targets for the 21st century.
As delegates worked behind closed doors to find a compromise, lobbyists -- particularly environmentalists and industry representatives -- worked to promote their contrary interpretations of the scientific data on global warming and thus two different views on the Earth's fate.
Certain fundamentals are conceded by all concerned. A natural blanket of atmospheric gases helps keep the planet warm by trapping solar radiation as it bounces off Earth's surface back toward space. Without this natural "greenhouse" effect, our world would, on average, be about 60 degrees colder than it is now.
But for centuries humans have added additional greenhouse gases to the mix, particularly carbon dioxide through the burning of coal, oil and gas.
Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have increased nearly 30 percent in the past two centuries, while methane and nitrous oxide -- two other greenhouse gases -- have increased by 100 percent and 15 percent, respectively. Nearly half of greenhouse gas emissions come from three dozen industrialized countries, including the United States.
Scientists see signs suggesting that global warming and its consequences have accompanied this accumulation of gases: a several-inch rise in sea level this century, possibly from polar and glacial melting; a decline in Northern Hemisphere snow cover; an increase in global surface temperatures of about 1 degree in the past 100 years; the fact that the nine warmest years this century have all occurred since 1980.
The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in research often cited by the U.S. government, has projected that temperatures could rise 2 to 8 degrees in the next century if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed. That, in turn, could lead to calamitous coastal and island flooding, dramatic climate changes and sweeping socioeconomic consequences.
Not so fast, say industry representatives. Where's the proof?
"The {climate change panel} has not determined that man-made emissions are having an impact on climate. There's only been a small increase in temperatures in the last 100 years, and most of that was before 1940," said John Schlaes, executive director of the Global Climate Coalition, which describes itself as the "leading U.S. business voice on climate change."
Founded in 1989, the coalition represents 55 companies and trade organizations, from the Aluminum Association to Union Pacific Railroad, with Exxon, Chevron and Texaco sandwiched in between. For these companies, curbing emissions from fossil fuel combustion could mean a loss of jobs, profits and the competitive advantages available to U.S. industry from relatively cheap energy supplies.
"There are many economic and scientific analyses that remain to be done so countries can consider the impact of their decisions on their economies and competitiveness," Schlaes added in an interview.
In a similar vein, the United Mineworkers of America circulated a statement this week urging conference delegates to reject "tough targets and timetables until essential scientific uncertainties are resolved." A Kuwaiti climatologist, reflecting an OPEC viewpoint, suggested that global warming is correlated more to "sunspot cycles and volcanic eruptions" than to carbon dioxide emissions from oil and coal use.
"All they need to do is throw in the monkey wrench of doubt," Liz Barratt-Brown, senior attorney for the Washington-based Natural Resources Defense Council, said of skeptics. "When you're dealing with a difficult subject like this, that's enough to stop progress."
To counterattack along economic lines, Greenpeace this week allied itself with the insurance industry to warn that weather run amok from global warming could cause multibillion-dollar storms that will hurt consumers by causing higher insurance costs.
The Environmental Defense Fund sought to promote the link between global warming and greenhouse gas emissions by arranging interviews with Bert Bolin, chairman of the climate change panel and a prominent climatologist at the University of Stockholm. Bolin said another huge U.N. study, due for release later this year, will show more clearly than ever the links between man-made pollutants, climate and the probable consequences.
"There are accumulating signs that there really is an ongoing climate change, the magnitude of which is difficult to assess," Bolin said in an interview. "To turn around developments in the field of energy is like trying to stop an oil tanker; it takes decades. . . . Nobody argues for draconian steps. What's important is to find a strategy, an approach, some first steps."

Thursday, March 30, 1995
Berlin GERMANY -- BERLIN Insurance executives were making the rounds of leading delegations yesterday at the United Nations conference on climate change. Fearing environmental catastrophes will bankrupt them if governments do not halt global warming by reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, they are taking on a new role as friends of the Earth. According to a chief Lloyd's of London underwriter, Richard Keeling, insurers have suffered losses to every major storm since 1987 - $20-billion (U.S.) alone to Hurricane Andrew in 1992.

Full text: From Mr Jeremy Berkoff
Sir: Frances Cairncross may be right that the most rational course is to adapt to climate change when it happens, but the operative word is "may". Nowhere in her article does she address the risks involved.
What happens if global warming greatly accelerates? To quote William Cline to the effect that the benefits of taking action on global warming do not overtake the costs until about 2150 implies that he actually knows. He doesn't, because no one knows - for certain.
Moreover, to state that the world has only so much wealth to devote to solving environmental problems is nonsense. It may decide to devote only so much, but that is quite another matter. The choice is not merely, or even significantly, between resolving water pollution problems and anticipating global warming, but in the proportion of world wealth that is devoted to any particular purpose in competition with all others. And, given the dangers involved, I would have thought that reducing the risks associated with global warming should by any standards be a priority.
The insurance industry makes its living by distributing known risks among many. Unfortunately, there is only one earth and the risks of global warming are unknown. Moreover, those who cause the problem do not share equally in the risks, and those that take action benefit those who don't. Thus, the option of leaving it to the market (however defined) is unavailable. Since the risk premium will be to some extent arbitrary, and since some consideration should presumably be given to equity, the only possible mechanism is "the laborious negotiation of complex international treaties" which Ms Cairncross so derides.
Yours faithfully,
JEREMY BERKOFF

What if the globe is warming? This week's UN conference can ensure we're ready if scientists prove the threat is real: [Final Edition]

Abstract: In this environment, not even die-hard greens expect the Berlin meeting to negotiate binding targets and timetables for cutting emissions. It is unlikely that it will ever prove possible to do so until there is conclusive evidence of warming. As long as a vigorous research and global monitoring effort is maintained -- budget cutters, take note -- that's a reasonable risk to run. Some 130 countries are attending the two-week UN conference on global warming that began Tuesday in Berlin. The meeting is a follow- up to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. There, delegates adopted the Convention on Climate Change, which says industrialized countries must reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. Few of the 127 countries that have ratified the accord can tell the Berlin conference that they can meet the goal. Environment Minister Sheila Copps said that, in an effort to break an impasse between developed and developing countries on how to stabilize emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, Canada will propose international trading in pollution permits. Ms Copps will push the emissions-trading idea at ministerial-level talks at the conference next week.

Full text: As the more than 100 nations that have signed the global climate treaty are gathered in Berlin this week for their first meeting, some recent news bulletins from the planet set the stage:
* Warming is changing the shape of the Antarctic Peninsula. Last month an ice shelf disintegrated, breaking off an iceberg on which the state of Rhode Island would fit comfortably. Said one scientist: "Looking out of the aircraft window I was utterly amazed. . . . In 25 years of Antarctic fieldwork I have never seen anything like it."
* A 50,000-square-mile region of the Pacific Ocean has lost 80 per cent of its zooplankton, the microscopic organisms near the base of the food chain. The loss coincides with a four-decade rise in water temperature. One of the scientists reporting the results two weeks ago described himself as "flabbergasted" at how few fish and birds are left. "It's already pretty dead out there."
* Coral reefs from the Caribbean to the South Pacific are sick, apparently from warmer water. Glaciers are in full retreat. Snow cover and Arctic sea ice are declining. The weather pattern known as El Nino (which is causing California's current misery) is occurring more frequently and lasting longer.
None of these proves that global warming is under way. Each of them could be due to natural fluctuations. But the accumulation of suggestive evidence leaves fewer doubts.
Scientists will say on the record only what they can prove, but like everyone else they have gut feelings. For more and more of them the question is not if, but when and in what form, the greenhouse smoking gun will appear.
Though major uncertainties remain, greenhouse science has made steady strides since the convention was signed three years ago. Computer models of global climate can now produce a regional pattern that accounts for hitherto confounding patches of warming and cooling. The advance gives climatologists far greater confidence in the models' long-term predictions.
Possible impacts
Meanwhile, governments and a few industries (the insurance industry in particular) have been getting a taste of the possible costs of climate change.
The last 10 years in the United States have seen a steady stream of multibillion-dollar weather disasters, beginning with the southeastern drought in 1986, the worst in 287 years, and including the drought that closed the Mississippi in 1988, its flood five years later, California's six-year drought and its current floods, and a series of record-breaking hurricanes.
The point is not that these are proof of climate change, though more frequent floods and more severe droughts are what the models predict. What they drive home in a way that no study can is that neither wealth nor high technology is protection against weather extremes.
While they may recognize a greater vulnerability, governments have also learned that reducing carbon dioxide emissions is a lot harder than they had supposed so long as energy prices remain low. The climate convention called on the industrialized countries to bring their emissions back to 1990 levels by 2000. Of those that have submitted plans for doing so, nine of 15 countries expect to miss the goal.
Because of higher economic growth and lower oil prices than were projected, and the defeat of the Clinton administration's Btu tax, it appears that the United States will exceed the voluntary target by a whopping 6 per cent.
The political climate is also a good deal less welcoming to ambitious international undertakings than it was at the Rio Summit. As the time nears when painful adjustments may have to be made, opposition stiffens from industries and countries that will be hurt. The leaders of the coalition trying to block action are oil- dependent Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and coal-dependent China.
In this environment, not even die-hard greens expect the Berlin meeting to negotiate binding targets and timetables for cutting emissions. It is unlikely that it will ever prove possible to do so until there is conclusive evidence of warming. As long as a vigorous research and global monitoring effort is maintained -- budget cutters, take note -- that's a reasonable risk to run.
For now, success in Berlin has three elements. The conference must set up a system that will be able to act when it needs to. A mechanism to track and evaluate each country's emissions and voting rules that require large majorities but not consensus are crucial. A veto by each nation prevents action.
It must also agree to begin thinking beyond 2000 even though the modest goals for that year will not be met. Given that emissions make themselves felt not just years or decades but centuries after they are produced, a five-year horizon is ludicrously inapt. Looking ahead means that reduction plans will have to include the developing countries where most future energy growth will occur.
Finally, the conference needs to agree on the principle (known as joint implementation) that emissions reductions should be sought wherever they are cheapest, whether that is in the country that is paying for them (probably a developed country) or somewhere else (likely in the developing world).
Though the idea is politically explosive because it suggests that rich societies won't have to change their lifestyles while poor ones will, no other approach makes economic or atmospheric sense.
Greenhouse science doesn't today provide the smoking gun necessary for substantial emissions reductions. A growing number of signals from the planet suggests, however, that the time for action may not be far off.
Berlin's vital task is global readiness.

The UN conference
Some 130 countries are attending the two-week UN conference on global warming that began Tuesday in Berlin. The meeting is a follow- up to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. There, delegates adopted the Convention on Climate Change, which says industrialized countries must reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. Few of the 127 countries that have ratified the accord can tell the Berlin conference that they can meet the goal.
Environment Minister Sheila Copps said that, in an effort to break an impasse between developed and developing countries on how to stabilize emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, Canada will propose international trading in pollution permits. Ms Copps will push the emissions-trading idea at ministerial-level talks at the conference next week.
Primer
A primer on global warming:
* Effects could include a rise in global sea level which would threaten coastal cities, an increase in the frequency of heat waves and droughts, extinction of many plants and animals.
* There is uncertainty about the timing, magnitude and regional patterns of climate change.
* The world's average temperature has been gradually rising since the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
* Concentrations of carbon dioxide, largely from burning coal and oil, have increased substantially during the same period.
* The heat-trapping properties of carbon dioxide and some other industrial gases are well known.
* Earth's warmest years since 1861 have been 1981, 1983, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991.

Full text: As the more than 100 nations that have signed the global climate treaty prepare to gather in Berlin this week for their first meeting, some recent news bulletins from the planet set the stage:
Warming is changing the shape of the Antarctic Peninsula. Last month an ice shelf disintegrated, breaking off an iceberg on which the state of Rhode Island would fit comfortably. Said one scientist: "Looking out of the aircraft window I was utterly amazed. In 25 years of Antarctic fieldwork I have never seen anything like it."
A 50,000-square-mile region of the Pacific Ocean has lost 80 percent of its zooplankton, the microscopic organisms near the base of the food chain. The loss coincides with a four-decade rise in water temperature. One of the scientists reporting the results two weeks ago described himself as "flabbergasted" at how few fish and birds are left. "It's already pretty dead out there."
Coral reefs from the Caribbean to the South Pacific are sick, apparently from warmer water. Glaciers are in full retreat. Snow cover and arctic sea ice are declining. The weather pattern known as El Nio, which caused California's recent misery, is occurring more frequently and lasting longer.
None of these proves that global warming is under way. Each of them could be due to natural fluctuations. But the accumulation of suggestive evidence leaves fewer doubts. Scientists will say on the record only what they can prove, but like everyone else they have gut feelings. For more and more of them the question is not if, but when and in what form, the greenhouse smoking gun will appear.
Though major uncertainties remain, greenhouse science has made steady strides since the convention was signed three years ago. Computer models of global climate can now produce a regional pattern that accounts for hitherto confounding patches of warming and cooling. The advance gives climatologists far greater confidence in the models' long-term predictions.
Meanwhile, governments and a few industries the insurance industry in particular have been getting a taste of the possible costs of climate change. The last 10 years in the United States have seen a steady stream of multibillion-dollar weather disasters, beginning with the southeastern drought in 1986, the worst in 287 years, and including the drought that closed the Mississippi River in 1988, its flood five years later, California's six-year drought and its current floods, and a series of record-breaking hurricanes. The point is not that these are proof of climate change, though more frequent floods and more severe droughts are what the models predict. What they drive home in a way that no study can is that neither wealth nor high technology is protection against weather extremes.
While they may recognize a greater vulnerability, governments have also learned that reducing carbon dioxide emissions is a lot harder than they had supposed so long as energy prices remain low. The climate convention called on the industrialized countries to bring their emissions back to 1990 levels by 2000. Of those that have submitted plans for doing so, nine of 15 countries expect to miss the goal. Because of higher economic growth and lower oil prices than were projected, and the defeat of the administration's Btu tax, it appears that the United States will exceed the voluntary target by a whopping 6 percent.
The political climate is also a good deal less welcoming to ambitious international undertakings than it was at the Rio Summit. As the time nears when painful adjustments may have to be made, opposition stiffens from industries and countries that will be hurt. The leaders of the coalition trying to block action are oil-dependent Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and coal-dependent China.
In this environment, not even die-hard greens expect the Berlin meeting to negotiate binding targets and timetables for cutting emissions. It is unlikely that it will ever prove possible to do so until there is conclusive evidence of warming. As long as a vigorous research and global monitoring effort is maintained budget cutters, take note that's a reasonable risk to run.
For now, success in Berlin has three elements. The conference must set up a system that will be able to act when it needs to. A mechanism to track and evaluate each country's emissions and voting rules that require large majorities but not consensus are crucial. It must also agree to begin thinking beyond 2000 even though the modest goals for that year will not be met. Given that emissions make themselves felt not just years or decades but centuries after they are produced, a five-year horizon is ludicrously inapt. Looking ahead means that reduction plans will have to include the developing countries where most future energy growth will occur.
Finally, the conference needs to agree on the principle known as joint implementation that emissions reductions should be sought wherever they are cheapest, whether that is in the country that is paying for them (probably a developed country) or somewhere else (likely in the developing world). Though the idea is politically explosive because it suggests that rich societies won't have to change their lifestyles while poor ones will, no other approach makes economic or atmospheric sense.
Greenhouse science doesn't today provide the smoking gun necessary for substantial emissions reductions. A growing number of signals from the planet suggests, however, that the time for action may not be far off. Berlin's vital task is global readiness.

Abstract: JOHN Major told MPs yesterday that former Tory deputy chairman, Lord Archer, was and would remain his friend, as a Labour MP pressed him over the law on insider dealing. Dale Campbell-Savours (Workington), who was forced to quit the Commons on a previous occasion after making allegations against Lord Archer, said at question time that Commons rules "prevent me from raising aspects of the trading activities of Lord Archer, your friend . . . But in the light of the fact that the prosecuting authorities have repeatedly failed to prosecute successfully people who have committed the offence of insider trading - and we all know who we are talking about - isn't it about time there was a full review of the law?" Mr Major confirmed "that Lord Archer is my friend, has been my friend and will remain my friend in the future . . . If the law officers feel something is going amiss they will approach me and the necessary action will be taken."

* A PERSISTENT Tory critic of the Government's package of measures for the unemployed intervened as it cleared the Commons last night. Former education minister Alan Howarth (Stratford-on-Avon) asked Employment Minister Ann Widdecombe: "Do you personally look forward to a world of benefit cuts and boot camps?" Miss Widdecombe replied that she looked forward to a world of focused, targeted benefits for those in need. The Jobseekers Bill, which cuts entitlement to non means-tested benefit from one year to six months, reduces help for the jobless with mortgage repayments, and introduces measures to help people find work, was given a third reading by 269 to 239 (Government majority 30) and now goes to the Lords.

Long-term predictions
Though major uncertainties remain, greenhouse science has made steady strides since the convention was signed three years ago. Computer models of global climate can now produce a regional pattern that accounts for hitherto confounding patches of warming and cooling. The advance gives climatologists far greater confidence in the models' long-term predictions.

The point is not that these are proof of climate change, though more frequent floods and more severe droughts are what the models predict. What they drive home in a way that no study can is that neither wealth nor high technology is protection against weather extremes.
While they may recognize a greater vulnerability, governments have also learned that reducing carbon-dioxide emissions is a lot harder than they had supposed, so long as energy prices remain low.

Of those that have submitted plans for doing so, nine of 15 countries expect to miss the goal. Because of higher economic growth and lower oil prices than were projected, it appears that the United States will exceed the voluntary target by a whopping 6 per cent.
Painful adjustments
The political climate is also a good deal less welcoming to ambitious international undertakings than it was at the Rio Summit in 1992. As the time nears when painful adjustments may have to be made, opposition stiffens from industries and countries that will be hurt.
In this environment, not even die-hard greens expect the Berlin meeting to negotiate binding targets and timetables for cutting emissions.

A 50,000-square-mile region of the Pacific Ocean has lost 80 percent of its zooplankton, the microscopic organisms near the base of the food chain. The loss coincides with a four-decade rise in water temperature. One of the scientists reporting the results two weeks ago described himself as "flabbergasted" at how few fish and birds are left. "It's already pretty dead out there."
Coral reefs from the Caribbean to the South Pacific are sick, apparently from warmer water. Glaciers are in full retreat. Snow cover and arctic sea ice are declining. The weather pattern known as El Nino (which is causing California's current misery) is occurring more frequently and lasting longer.
None of these proves that global warming is underway. Each of them could be due to natural fluctuations. But the accumulation of suggestive evidence leaves fewer doubts. Scientists will say on the record only what they can prove, but like everyone else they have gut feelings. For more and more of them the question is not if, but when and in what form, the greenhouse smoking gun will appear.
Though major uncertainties remain, greenhouse science has made steady strides since the convention was signed three years ago. Computer models of global climate can now produce a regional pattern that accounts for hitherto confounding patches of warming and cooling. The advance gives climatologists far greater confidence in the models' long-term predictions.
Meanwhile, governments and a few industries (the insurance industry in particular) have been getting a taste of the possible costs of climate change. The last 10 years in the United States have seen a steady stream of multibillion-dollar weather disasters, beginning with the southeastern drought in 1986, the worst in 287 years, and including the drought that closed the Mississippi in 1988, its flood five years later, California's six-year drought and its current floods, and a series of record-breaking hurricanes. The point is not that these are proof of climate change, though more frequent floods and more severe droughts are what the models predict. What they drive home in a way that no study can is that neither wealth nor high technology is protection against weather extremes.
While they may recognize a greater vulnerability, governments have also learned that reducing carbon dioxide emissions is a lot harder than they had supposed so long as energy prices remain low. The climate convention called on the industrialized countries to bring their emissions back to 1990 levels by 2000. Of those that have submitted plans for doing so, nine of 15 countries expect to miss the goal. Because of higher economic growth and lower oil prices than were projected, and the defeat of the administration's Btu tax, it appears that the United States will exceed the voluntary target by a whopping 6 percent.
The political climate is also a good deal less welcoming to ambitious international undertakings than it was at the Rio Summit. As the time nears when painful adjustments may have to be made, opposition stiffens from industries and countries that will be hurt. The leaders of the coalition trying to block action are oil-de\pendent Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and coal-dependent China.
In this environment, not even die-hard greens expect the Berlin meeting to negotiate binding targets and timetables for cutting emissions. It is unlikely that it will ever prove possible to do so until there is conclusive evidence of warming. As long as a vigorous research and global monitoring effort is maintained -- budget cutters, take note -- that's a reasonable risk to run.
For now, success in Berlin has three elements. The conference must set up a system that will be able to act when it needs to. A mechanism to track and evaluate each country's emissions and voting rules that require large majorities but not consensus are crucial. It must also agree to begin thinking beyond 2000 even though the modest goals for that year will not be met. Given that emissions make themselves felt not just years or decades but centuries after they are produced, a five-year horizon is ludicrously inapt. Looking ahead means that reduction plans will have to include the developing countries where most future energy growth will occur.
Finally, the conference needs to agree on the principle (known as joint implementation) that emissions reductions should be sought wherever they are cheapest, whether that is in the country that is paying for them (probably a developed country) or somewhere else (likely in the developing world). Though the idea is politically explosive because it suggests that rich societies won't have to change their lifestyles while poor ones will, no other approach makes economic or atmospheric sense.
Greenhouse science doesn't today provide the smoking gun necessary for substantial emissions reductions. A growing number of signals from the planet suggests, however, that the time for action may not be far off. Berlin's vital task is global readiness.

Full text: IT HAS BECOME fashionable (and therefore predictable) for advocates of global warming theories to pronounce every severe weather-related disaster as evidence that the Earth is heating up and on course with catastrophe. Such claims are false.
The new scientific evidence that disputes these assertions is found in a recent Accu-Weather report: "Changing Weather? Facts and Fallacies about Climate Change."
Based on an analysis of weather during the past 100 years, Accu-Weather found that:
The slight increase in average climate temperature that has occurred during the past century falls well within the limits of natural climate variability and does not signal a man-made "greenhouse" crisis.
Severe storms such as tornadoes and hurricanes have not shown any tendency to occur more frequently today than they have in the past.
The heavy January rains in Southern California are not unprecedented.
Record high temperatures are not occurring more frequently now than they have at other times in the past 100 years.
Data collected from scientists and the National Weather Service confirm that hurricanes and typhoons have not increased in frequency.
In fact, the number of tropical storms that eventually became hurricanes varies widely throughout the 109 years of record-keeping. For example, there were four hurricanes in 1992 (the year Hurricane Andrew struck Florida and Louisiana), compared with 10 hurricanes in 1887, and 11 in 1916.
In addition, concerns that tornadoes are becoming more frequent and severe are not well founded.
The data show that tornadoes in the strong (winds from 113 to 206 mph) and violent (winds between 207 and 318 mph) classifications have not increased from 1953 to 1993, the last year data are available.
Conversely, the reported number of weak tornadoes (winds less than 112 mph) has increased. Undoubtedly many small tornadoes sighted today would have gone unreported in years past. America's increased population, urban sprawl and greater public awareness have resulted in better detection. So, while we are spotting and reporting more small tornadoes, it is not clear that occurrences actually have increased.
January's 12 inches of rainfall and flooding in Southern California have led some to question whether those events are unusual and produced by global warming. Rainfall records in Los Angeles, dating back to 1878, provide the answer to both questions: No.
There were five monthly record rainfalls before this century. Los Angeles received 15.8 inches of rain in December 1889. This superseded the record-setting month of February 1884, when the city received 13.37 inches of rainfall.
Interestingly, the recent January rains, despite their drenching, were well below the record for that month. Los Angeles received 14.94 inches of rain in January 1969.
Recent independent analyses of temperature records by university meteorologists have confirmed Accu-Weather's conclusions that high temperatures in the past decade across the entire nation are not unique.
For example, the severe Midwestern heat wave and drought of the late 1980s was more than matched by the "dust bowl" of the 1930s. In fact, record high summer temperatures have been set many times in the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast during the past 100 years.
Average global air temperatures have increased by about one-half degree Celsius during the past century, but this increase is well within the range of natural variation.
It is significant that most of the increase occurred between 1916 and the mid-1940s - before the rapid increase of manmade carbon dioxide emissions that global warming theorists claim is responsible for increased temperatures.
A natural question arises: If weather events today are no worse than they were throughout the past century, why does it seem weather has gotten more volatile?
First, there are the advances in technologies used to detect and record weather data, not the least of which are global satellite systems.
Second, the electronic media efficiently gathers and reports dramatic weather information from around the world. In the age of instant communications, enterprising television networks can bring severe storms right into our living room, virtually as they are happening. Less than two decades ago this kind of instant access to dramatic events was not available to television audiences.
Yet another factor in the perceived increase in catastrophic weather is the fact that more people are living in coastal areas. This increases the likelihood that when storms strike, property damage will be great. Increasing losses may be of significant concern to the insurance industry, but they do not signal climate change or global warming.
At the same time property damages have increased, the number of American deaths caused by natural weather disasters has declined during the latter part of this century. The same technology that contributes to the perception that modern-day weather is more severe also provides a much better early warning system that gives people in high-risk areas more time to evacuate, thereby saving lives.
We are much more aware of hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and droughts but there is no evidence that they are increasing in intensity and frequency. Moreover, there is no evidence that extreme weather events are linked to greenhouse gas emissions in the environment.
The point is that weather data should not be misused to imply that global warming catastrophe lies just over the horizon.

Abstract: This has been a good week for coincidences.

The earth's unstable climate, in short, was back on the agenda. The flooding in Europe, the worst in some areas for a century, has raised a question by now depressingly familiar to climatologists. Is global warming - specifically the increased turbulence which, according to most models, will result from pumping gas into the atmosphere - to blame? The proper scientific answer is no. The reality is more complex. Since scientists at the Toronto convention in 1988 suggested a 60 per cent cut in the world's emissions of greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide - little has occurred to upset forecasts of a potentially catastrophic rise of up to 3C in global temperature by the second half of the next century.

Full text: Global warming is indeed to blame for the floods, says David Nicholson- Lord
This has been a good week for coincidences. Just as a Commons select committee was being warned that the Lloyd's of London insurance market was insolvent, much of northern Europe was dis-appearing under water. The earth's unstable climate, in short, was back on the agenda.
The flooding in Europe, the worst in some areas for a century, has raised a question by now depressingly familiar to climatologists. Is global warming - specifically the increased turbulence which, according to most models, will result from pumping gas into the atmosphere - to blame? The proper scientific answer is no. The reality is more complex.
Since scientists at the Toronto convention in 1988 suggested a 60 per cent cut in the world's emissions of greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide - little has occurred to upset forecasts of a potentially catastrophic rise of up to 3C in global temperature by the second half of the next century.
Global temperatures continue to rise and the storms, floods, heatwaves and drought consistent with the greenhouse hypothesis still amaze us.
But it is impossible to point to one storm or flood as the consequence of global warming. It probably always will be. This does not prevent you from saying that the longer the turbulence lasts, the shorter the odds - and the greater the need to recalculate them.
The European floods may help in that recalculation. Next month the Climate Change Convention, launched at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and which commits its signatory nations to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2000, holds its first assessment meeting in Berlin. It will survey a world much changed since 1988.
First, there is widespread acknowledgement, particularly within the insurance industry, that "natural" disasters are increasingly man-made and that global warming is high on the list of suspects: the huge reinsurance bill resulting from storms such as Hurricane Hugo are at least partly responsible for the Lloyd's debacle. Second, most climatologists agree that nothing like enough is being done to curb carbon emissions. And third, the cost benefit assessment of global warming has changed dramatically.
Governments have trodden lightly in trying to curb our appetite for fossil fuels. Voters, it was argued, would not put up with dearer petrol; industrial competitiveness would be damaged. But with the bill for a single hurricane, Andrew in 1992, running at pounds 10bn, such arguments look increasingly threadbare. One recent study concluded that measures to halt global warming would cost 2 per cent of US gross domestic product, but that failure to halt it would cost between 6 per cent and 20 per cent of GDP.
Equally important, policies to curb global warming make growing political as well as economic sense. They create jobs, for example - in anything from planting trees (which soak up carbon) to wind and solar power and energy conservation. In the US the netemployment gain has been put at 3 million jobs. EU estimates suggest that taxes on pollution, instead of taxes on labour, would create 2.7 million new jobs. Merely insulating homes in Britain would generate 50,000 jobs a year.
The row over VAT on fuel gave the impression that energy efficiency means higher fuel bills and not much else. With a Government bent on boosting Treasury receipts at the expense of pensioners this was a reasonable conclusion to draw, but it was the wrong one. Cutting our carbon emissions is not only emerging as the safest and cheapest option for the future. It also means more and better work - not least improving homes instead of mopping them up after the damage.

Full text: It's been a wild climatic ride.
In the past few weeks, Metro has weathered snow, fog, sleet, rain, flooding, even lightning. We've had freezes and thaws, and near-record highs like Jan. 14's balmy 13.1C.
And, after 11 days of rain, the snows came. By late yesterday, Toronto was blanketed with 9.4 centimetres of snow, and forecasters were confidently predicting more to come.
What's going on? Is it global warming, or just another cyclical blip in weather patterns?
Scientists are divided. But there's one thing they agree on: there's stormy weather ahead.
And that includes an increasing risk of hurricanes.
``The risk is real we will see more frequent and intense hurricanes reaching into North America and our region,'' says Henry Hengeveld, senior adviser on climate change for Environment Canada.
He points to several reasons:
* Increased sea temperatures, which mean greater opportunities for hurricanes to build and grow. Hurricanes need water temperatures of 27C.
* After a 30-year lull, the U.S. coast has been lashed by a series of hurricanes, 11 causing more than $1 billion each in damages in the past five years.
* An international $1.2 billion NASA weather tracking system, which includes numerous Canadian scientists, has discovered sea current and wind changes that indicate a growing area of ocean storms.
Meanwhile, Canada's climate has warmed 1C during the past century, Hengeveld says.
While the chances of another Hurricane Hazel - which caused 81 deaths and displaced 1,868 southern Ontario families in 1954 - remain relatively remote, Metro won't be caught flat-footed should a hurricane arrive.
Metro's Emergency Measures Office, which co-ordinates activities of 26 agencies in the event of a natural disaster, has been on hurricane alert twice in recent years - for Hugo in 1989 and Andrew in 1992 - says Warren Leonard, who heads the office.
``We can't control what happens but we can control our response,'' adds Wayne Brocklehurst, information director for Emergency Preparedness Canada, a branch of the solicitor-general's ministry.
Weather forecasting is a federal responsibility. Roughly 7,000 weather alerts are issued each year throughout the country, and a special disaster relief fund for uninsured damage provides roughly $12 million a year in assistance to provinces coping with severe financial loss in a storm aftermath.
More than 1 million Canadians, mainly farmers and fishermen, have special radio receivers to receive weather warnings directly.
If a severe weather disaster threatens, the 26 Metro agencies ranging from hospitals to utilities to transportation systems that participate in our disaster plan are alerted.
People are warned to refrain from any unnecessary outdoor activity, power and medical emergency staff are assembled, hotels open their doors to stranded travellers and insurers prepare make-shift offices to handle emergency claims.
David Phillips, senior climatologist for Environment Canada, reports that 155 Canadians die each year from weather, with the majority dying from extreme cold. Another 500 die in road accidents in which weather conditions were the major factor, and 77 drownings are related directly to hypothermia from being immersed in cold water.
That might sound like a lot, but Phillips says Canadians should thank their lucky stars. ``We are probably one of the safest countries in the world for weather disasters.''
Canadians have adapted well to their climate, he says, staying indoors or off water during severe weather warnings, not building on flood plains and constructing buildings to withstand strong winds.
Canada has about 80 tornadoes a year and the prime tornado zone, in the southwest Ontario corridor of Windsor-Sarnia, experiences a large storm once every five years. Of the nine most severe tornadoes recorded in Canada, seven occurred in southern Ontario, but only minor ones have touched Metro.
We feel the effects of a tropical hurricane about once every two years, Phillips says.
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are taking a much closer look at how human-caused environmental changes are affecting climate.
Jim Bruce, a former assistant deputy minister of the environment and chairman of the United Nations Committee on Natural Disaster Reduction, points out that the '90s have been declared a decade for reducing the damage caused by nature.
His analysis has shown an increase in North Atlantic storms affecting Europe, and the storm surge has resulted in Germany buttressing its dikes.
Climate-related disasters are damaging people and property at three times the rate of other natural disasters, such as earthquakes, he says.
Hengeveld of Environment Canada says hurricanes can't be blamed totally on greenhouse gasses and the warming of the globe, since we've had periods of warming and periods of ice ages before that had nothing to do with pollution.
But when ``we talk in terms of risk - the risk of increasing hurricanes in Canada - the answer is yes,'' he says.
Mike Mikitiuk, a civil engineer at the University of Western Ontario's boundary layer wind tunnel laboratory, says Toronto buildings can probably handle any wind a hurricane would be able to throw at them.
When you look at the rest of the world, Canada is doing well, says Stanley Griffin, a vice- president of the Insurance Bureau of Canada, ``We've had mild exposure to natural disasters.''
But the ones we've had in the past decade have been costly and deadly:
* The 1985 Barrie tornado, which resulted in the deaths of 12 people and $71 million in claims.
* The 1987 Edmonton tornado, which swept through a trailer park. Twenty-seven people died and 300 were injured, while damage claims reached $115 million.
* A 1991 hail storm in Calgary resulted in more than $330 million worth of insurance claims, including crops and cars that were severely dented as they sat in driveways.
* A 1993 flood in Winnipeg caused $184 million damage over a three-week period.
Still, the Canadian experience pales in comparison to the $1 billion-a-year price tag for hurricanes in the United States during the past five years.
That, along with other changes in worldwide weather patterns, has scientists scrambling to determine just how much of the problem is being caused by pollution.
The International Mission to Planet Earth project - a $1.2 billion project involving 800 scientists from around the world, run through NASA - is compiling satellite information to analyze weather patterns.
In the first two years of satellite study, says program scientist Ghassen Asrar, scientists have noticed a shifting in ocean currents from the usual tropics- to-pole motion. He adds that it appears winds are turning the warm water back from its northward pattern.
Anomalies in weather have resulted, with normally rainy areas getting drought and others getting torrential rain.
``The arguments we used to justify the expense of this project is that these events can cause damage that is tremendous,'' he says.
Frank Nutter, president of the Reinsurance Association of America, says ``Whether it's cyclical or permanent caused by global warming, we have a changed environment. Nobody in the industry questions we are in for a greater frequency of hurricanes.''

Abstract: It is no wonder that in the past decade, insured U.S. property losses from natural disasters have risen alarmingly, punctuated by peak losses from hurricanes Hugo and Andrew. Through August 1994, before Tropical Storm Gordon struck, insured property losses had already exceeded those of 1989, the year of Hugo.

Full text:   Lee Bidgood Jr. is a retired chemist and an environmental activist. He lives in New Smyrna Beach.
Everyone talks about the weather, but nobody is doing anything about it. Right? Wrong!
People are adding to the atmospheric gases that keep our planet warm. We are turning up nature's thermostat by burning fossil fuels and destroying forests. Unfortunately, nature's thermostat has no readable scale, and it works after an unknown circuit delay.
As we discharge ever-larger tonnages of greenhouse gas, we can't be sure when nature's furnace will respond, or how hot planet Earth will become, but virtually all scientists expect some warming. Uncertainties about the timing, magnitude and local effects of global warming should not delay stringent measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions, despite the confusion spread by coal and petroleum interests who want to do business as usual. A confused public has failed to pressure its leaders into acting decisively.
One predicted effect of global warming is that the earth's weather will become more extreme - more floods, droughts and storms. Are we seeing the beginning of such a climate? Some rather conservative business people think so.
Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance firm, recently urged Western nations to meet their 1992 Earth Summit commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Wolf Bauer, the German firm's spokesman, said his company is "convinced that the trend towards more frequent and more severe natural disasters will continue in the future." Bauer indicated that his company intends to reduce its risks in areas vulnerable to climate change.
It is no wonder that in the past decade, insured U.S. property losses from natural disasters have risen alarmingly, punctuated by peak losses from hurricanes Hugo and Andrew. Through August 1994, before Tropical Storm Gordon struck, insured property losses had already exceeded those of 1989, the year of Hugo.
Bear in mind that insured losses are only part of the story.
Last July, flood damage in Georgia alone reached $1 billion, most of it uninsured. And human death and suffering has no price.
Munich Re isn't the only insurance firm to be hard-hit by recent disasters. Several have gone bankrupt, and now, world bankers are becoming concerned. Two European conferences of bankers were held recently to consider the investment implications of environmental problems, especially climate change.
When hardheaded insurance executives and bankers get the message about pending climate changes, Floridians should wake up. A NASA satellite measured an increased rate of rise in sea level in the past two years. Climatologists project about a 2- or 3-foot sea level rise in the next century. Visualize what that higher ocean, with more frequent and severe storms and hurricanes, would do to our coastal cities and economy. It's a grim picture.
Reducing the threat of global warming by conserving energy and developing renewable sources makes sense. It just takes a grass-roots effort to convince the politicians.

Abstract: This spring, the United Nations is convening a major powwow on climate change, with large delegations expected from both the fossil fuel and insurance industries. The only tribe as powerful as the coal and oil interests, insurers are weighing the possibility that recent weather catastrophes are the first real results of human-induced climate change. "It's quite easy to change the climate. A volcanic eruption, a lot of rain altering oceanic salinity, increased carbon emissions," explained UCSB's [James Kennett]. So far, according to his latest calculations, the planet's climate has "flickered," as he termed it, 21 times over the eons, going from hot to cold, from ice to typhoon. Only the most recent flood has been recorded by eyewitnesses: Both the ancient Hebrews and the Chumash put out news releases 11,000 years ago. You know the one preserved in Genesis 7, 8 and 9, but perhaps not the one attributed to the 19th-Century tribal chronicler, Maria Solares.

Full text: Before Christmas, Earthwatch reported that the ocean off our coast commences a process of "upwelling" water from its deepest reaches to take on oxygen before flowing back around the globe.
Over eons, this process has left sediment on the sea bottom that is now being studied as a long-term record of the planet's health.
The new data suggests that global climate can frequently "turn on a button," changed by little things-even human activity-according to Dr. James Kennett, leader of the UC Santa Barbara Marine Science Institute.
There's more to the story than last week's column could cover. Here's the rest:
In about 90 days, the sun and the sea are soon going to be linked in a big environmental story because of the global-warming issue. Historic climate and weather changes, recorded in the sea bottom, along with recent episodes of severe air pollution trapping the sun's light, may be impacting a major world industry: insurance.
This spring, the United Nations is convening a major powwow on climate change, with large delegations expected from both the fossil fuel and insurance industries. The only tribe as powerful as the coal and oil interests, insurers are weighing the possibility that recent weather catastrophes are the first real results of human-induced climate change.
Fearing that the worst is yet to come, they see their interests conflicting directly with those of the fossil fuel industry in the controversy over carbon emissions, that cause smog.
The president of the Reinsurance Assn. of America, Franklin Nutter, said recently, "The insurance business is first in line to be affected by climate change . . . it could bankrupt the industry."
Last time something like this happened, the issue was shoddy, dangerous building practices. So the insurance companies fought for strict building codes. They might have to stand up for strict pollution standards this time. This month they convened a National Hazards Group. We will see its handiwork in March.
Meanwhile, while the titans square off, ordinary California homeowners are already finding notifications of flood-insurance rate hikes in their mail. In some cases, mercifully not yet in our county, it's a 50% increase.
In south Los Angeles County, along the Los Angeles and San Gabriel rivers, whole towns are having rates increased and the locals are fighting it because it's affecting real estate values.
Insurance actuaries are recalculating risk factors that had been stable for decades. This has also triggered new, complex federal requirements that flood insurance be obtained prior to mortgage transactions.
Purchases and sales are being impeded. It's like a reverse neutron bomb-an environmental problem that, regardless of whether it might harm people's health, is affecting their property. This sort of thing could spawn legions of anti-smog activists.
"It's quite easy to change the climate. A volcanic eruption, a lot of rain altering oceanic salinity, increased carbon emissions," explained UCSB's Kennett. So far, according to his latest calculations, the planet's climate has "flickered," as he termed it, 21 times over the eons, going from hot to cold, from ice to typhoon.
Only the most recent flood has been recorded by eyewitnesses: Both the ancient Hebrews and the Chumash put out news releases 11,000 years ago. You know the one preserved in Genesis 7, 8 and 9, but perhaps not the one attributed to the 19th-Century tribal chronicler, Maria Solares.
Since the unveiling of data such as Kennett's, and the arrival of the insurance industry in the middle of these environmental goings on, Solares' version no longer seems merely quaint. Now, it evokes a sensibility more and more people share as we all enter the 25th Earth Year.
Here's what the Chumash chronicler says: "Spotted Woodpecker, Sun's nephew, was the only one saved in the flood. We don't know why the flood came or how it started, but it kept raining and the water kept rising higher and higher until even the mountains were covered.
"All the people drowned except Woodpecker, who found refuge on top of the tallest tree in the world. The water kept rising until it touched his feet. He cried out to Sun, `Help me, Uncle! I am drowning! Save me!' Sun held his torch down low and the water began to go down again."
That was when the world was smogless-and all power was solar. There now seems to be hope this can happen again. Happy New Year.

`Trading' Pollutants Is a Big First Step Toward Cleaner Air: [All 11/22/94 Edition]

Abstract: Niagara Mohawk will donate the sulfur dioxide allowances (which have a market value of about $3.8 million) to a nonprofit organization that will "retire" them. The utility thus will get a tax break of about $1 million to invest in further carbon-dioxide-reduction programs. This is good news for the Grand Canyon (which has been filling up with smog) and for the northern forests of New York (which have suffered from acid rain). It's working in New York because Niagara Mohawk is burning cleaner fuels and promoting energy conservation. It's working in the Southwest because Arizona Public Service is investing in new scrubbers at the Navajo Generating Station. Meeting in the Netherlands recently, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (a United Nations-sponsored group of scientists) declared that "even if global emissions could be stabilized, atmospheric concentrations {of carbon dioxide} would continue to rise for at least 200 years."

Full text: Much as we might wish for it, there is no easy way to get rid of air pollution - no simple answer to fume-spewing cars or fossil-fuel-burning power plants. It will take political compromise, a change in public attitudes and lifestyles, and, most of all, innovative ideas.
A groundbreaking agreement between electric utilities in Arizona and New York is one such idea. It's an important practical step toward reducing pollutants associated with global warming and acid rain.
It sounds like a game-board maneuver and works like this:
The Arizona Public Service Company is swapping 25,000 tons of sulfur dioxide with the Niagara Mohawk Power Company in exchange for 1.75 million tons of carbon dioxide.
The utilities aren't actually trucking this stuff back and forth but trading "allowances" - the amounts they would have been able to release under the Clean Air Act. By doing better than they had to in reducing emissions, they have built up credits that are marketable under 1990 amendments to the law.
Niagara Mohawk will donate the sulfur dioxide allowances (which have a market value of about $3.8 million) to a nonprofit organization that will "retire" them. The utility thus will get a tax break of about $1 million to invest in further carbon-dioxide-reduction programs.
Arizona Public Service will use its newly acquired CO2 allowance as a kind of insurance against its own carbon-reduction program in an area of rapid growth. But company officials say they intend to meet their commitment without the credits and suggest they may "retire" them as well.
This is good news for the Grand Canyon (which has been filling up with smog) and for the northern forests of New York (which have suffered from acid rain). It's working in New York because Niagara Mohawk is burning cleaner fuels and promoting energy conservation. It's working in the Southwest because Arizona Public Service is investing in new scrubbers at the Navajo Generating Station.
"This is a gutsy, innovative solution that cleans the air without breaking corporate or household budgets," US Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said in announcing the agreement. It proves that "market-based solutions will always yield the most cost-effective outcomes while achieving the greatest environmental benefit," she said.
A key player in the deal has been the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a private organization that specializes in linking science, economics, and law to find reasonable solutions to environmental problems. EDF has been advising both utilities and the Energy Department.
This first-of-its-kind agreement is good, but there will have to be a lot more to meet clean-air goals. The Clean Air Network (a coalition of groups) reported last week that "more than 100 million Americans still live in areas with unhealthful air quality." And it noted that many states have yet to come up with plans required under the Clean Air Act to meet federal health standards.
Under the Climate Change Convention agreed to at the Earth Summit in Brazil two years ago, 160 countries have agreed to reduce "greenhouse gases" to 1990 levels by the year 2000. But it's a pretty weak agreement, and many countries have done little.
Meeting in the Netherlands recently, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (a United Nations-sponsored group of scientists) declared that "even if global emissions could be stabilized, atmospheric concentrations {of carbon dioxide} would continue to rise for at least 200 years."
This means vigorous ways to reduce polluting gases below 1990 levels will have to be found - in other words, not producing them in the first place through energy conservation and pioneering efforts like the ones that utilities in Arizona and New York have just launched.

THREAT OF NATURAL DISASTERS POSES HUGE THREAT TO INSURANCE INDUSTRY

Abstract: [Ann Deering], who last fall sponsored a conference that brought environmentalists and the insurance industry together to discuss the industry's rising exposure to disasters, said there may be disagreements over climate change -- but there is no dispute that losses to disasters are soaring. The problem facing the insurance industry is a sharp increase in the amount of insured property in vulnerable areas such as on the coasts and in earthquake-prone locations. Combined with that is an increase in the severity of storms, a phenomenon some say is merely cyclical and others say is attributable to human-caused climate disruptions such as the buildup of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. Deering said European and Japanese insurance companies have drawn a stronger link between their huge losses and global climate change, although she said many U.S. insurers also now believe there may be a connection. Regardless, the buildup of coastal populations and property presents a vulnerability that did not exist four decades ago when coastal areas where sparsely populated.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. insurance industry, reeling from mounting catastrophic losses and exposed to record levels of risk from storms, floods and fires, is becoming a true believer in global climate-change theories.
The threats to the industry are becoming so severe that some white-knuckled insurance executives are joining the likes of Greenpeace in lobbying for government policies to reduce global warming by searching for alternative energy sources.
"I have talked to very senior people in all major markets," said Jeremy Leggett, scientific director of Greenpeace International's Climate Campaign. "And they are unanimous that the threat is huge."
Leggett said the Caribbean insurance industry "is in a full-scale crisis," due to spiraling losses from severe weather, while insurance giants in Japan, such as Tokyo Marine and Fire, could be wiped out by a major typhoon.
In the United States, where government climate experts are predicting an increasing hurricane cycle, a possible return next year of another disastrous El Nino weather system, and years of worsening coastal erosion, the insurance industry is taking an urgent look at climate-change issues.
"Whether or not climate change is happening, the forecast is that hurricane activity will increase," said Ann Deering, president of New York-based Environmental Technology & Telecommunications Ltd., a risk and environmental consultant to insurance and other industries.
Deering, who last fall sponsored a conference that brought environmentalists and the insurance industry together to discuss the industry's rising exposure to disasters, said there may be disagreements over climate change -- but there is no dispute that losses to disasters are soaring.
Some unsettling statistics:
-- According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the nation's coastal population will increase from 112 million in 1990 to 127 million, or nearly 400 people per square mile, in 2010. In its past two annual reviews of the nation's weather, NOAA dubbed 1992 "a year of notable weather extremes" and said 1993 was marked by "highly anomalous weather."
-- According to the Reinsurance Association of America, the total insured value of homes and businesses in those coastal communities in the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts alone was $1.1 trillion in 1980. By 1993, it had risen to more than $2 trillion.
-- Through June, the more than $8.5 billion paid out in catastrophic losses this year makes 1994 the second worst year on record, following 1992's $23 billion in losses.
-- The ability for insurance companies worldwide to pay claims for catastrophic losses in a given year is estimated at $160 billion. For perspective, Hurricane Andrew in south Florida caused $16.5 billion in damages. And had it hit Miami, the total would have been closer to $50 billion. A worst-case hurricane hitting New York, according to insurance models, could cause up to $100 billion in damages.
The problem facing the insurance industry is a sharp increase in the amount of insured property in vulnerable areas such as on the coasts and in earthquake-prone locations. Combined with that is an increase in the severity of storms, a phenomenon some say is merely cyclical and others say is attributable to human-caused climate disruptions such as the buildup of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels.
"If the question is whether natural disasters pose a huge threat to the insurance industry, the answer is, absolutely," said Jack Webber, executive director of the Natural Disaster Coalition, a group formed by insurers, emergency planners, lenders and others to reduce property losses from disasters.
"Of the 20 largest insured natural catastrophes we've had in the United States, 16 have occurred since 1989," said Frank Nutter, president of the Reinsurance Association of America. "If you look at the period from the 1940s to today, 45 percent of all claim dollars have been paid since 1990. What you see is a concentration of insured losses that is extraordinary in historical context."
If, as most climate researchers now project, global warming occurs, and if it increases the numbers and intensity of hurricanes, "we are on a collision course," Nutter said.
"The amount of exposure has increased exponentially in disaster areas," said Webber. "It's becoming increasingly obvious that the danger signs are there."
Deering said European and Japanese insurance companies have drawn a stronger link between their huge losses and global climate change, although she said many U.S. insurers also now believe there may be a connection. Regardless, the buildup of coastal populations and property presents a vulnerability that did not exist four decades ago when coastal areas where sparsely populated.
"Those two trends -- shifts in populations and higher value properties in the high-risk areas -- mean you are going to experience higher insured losses," said Nutter. "That, together with the climate, is a combination of trends the industry is very much concerned about."
Deering said many insurers are concerned that if ocean temperatures are warming, the hurricane-incubation area in the Atlantic will reach farther north, increasing the odds of hurricanes hitting more populous northern cities.
"Camille was a Category 5," she said of the 1969 hurricane that killed 256 in the Gulf of Mexico. "If it hit today, forget it."
If things continue as they are, and the anticipated "big one" hits, experts say insurers will be hard-pressed to pay claims. Solutions, besides increasing rates and deductibles, include mitigation measures such as adhering to building codes and, environmentalists argue, ending construction on the shore.
"After Andrew, six or seven insurance companies in Florida went under," said Beth Millman, executive director of the Coast Alliance, a leading critic of taxpayer-subsidized insurance in coastal areas in the form of flood insurance.
"The insurance industry has underwritten development in the surf zone," Millman said.
"Andrew{in 1992} and Hugo {in 1989} woke up the industry," she said. Millman said insurance companies correctly worry that a more severe climate could ruin the business, but the reality is the industry has insured structures that could be destroyed.
"Sea levels are going up and we are going to have storms," she said. "It makes bad financial sense for the houses to be there, period. It's an untenable risk."

Cleaner Cars Can Also Be Killer Cars: [NASSAU AND SUFFOLK Edition]

Abstract: Harvard University's Injury Control Center has also studied the safety question. The center's director, Dr. John Graham, has said in the short term, CAFE induces manufacturers to promote smaller cars; in the long run, it encourages them to reduce the weight and size of all vehicles. As a result, according to a recent study by Graham, a 40percent increase in fuel economy would cause an additional 1,650 deaths and 8,500 serious injuries every year. The analysis puts the rhetoric into perspective, and shatters the case for CAFE as a meaningful response to global warming. In fact, the government's own data show that U.S. cars and light trucks (the only vehicles subject to CAFE) are responsible for only 1.5 percent of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions. All new cars must meet the same strict anti-pollution standards, regardless of their fuel economy ratings. So, a full-sized model is just as clean as a sub-compact. U.S. air quality has improved dramtically over the past two decades. Today, the major auto-related contributors to smog are older, poorly maintained vehicles, and traffic congestion - not clean-burning, late model cars and light trucks.

Full text:   PROTECTING the environment has always meant trade-offs. Saving the Pacific Northwest's old-growth forests versus saving the jobs of thousands of loggers. Preserving fragile wetlands versus preserving private property rights. Protecting endangered species living in Southern California's dry brushes versus eliminating the brush to protect homes vulnerable to wildfires.
But if divisive questions spring up when economic interests are at stake, what about enviromental protections that put our own health and safety at risk?
This scenario describes precisely the risk of drastic increases in auto gas mileage requirements - known as CAFE standards - which many activists and some federal officials now claim would reduce the threat of global warming.
With no affordable technologies available that would allow dramatic fuel economy improvements (on the order of 40 percent) in midand full-size vehicles, the lion's share of fuel economy increases would have to flow from significant cuts in the vehicle size and weight.
And there's the rub - those are the two factors that contribute most to safety.
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the death rates in the smallest, lightest cars are double those in large, heavy vehicles.
Similarly, the National Academy of Sciences recognizes that, in spite of safety improvements in cars, smaller vehicles continue to provide less occupant protection than larger cars. Safety and fuel economy are linked, says the academy, because one of the most direct methods of increasing gas mileage is reducing size and weight.
As a result, the academy admits, it may be "inevitable" that significant increases in fuel economy can occur only with some negative safety consequences.
But just how negative is "negative"? According to statements by the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 1991, the consequences would be dire. Studies by the safety agency found that fuel economy gains in the last 1970s and early 1980s had come largely from a 1,000-pound reduction in average vehicle weight. NHTSA also said 2,000 fatalities and 20,000 serious injuries occur annually as a result of the downsizing of the passenger car fleet during that period.
Harvard University's Injury Control Center has also studied the safety question. The center's director, Dr. John Graham, has said in the short term, CAFE induces manufacturers to promote smaller cars; in the long run, it encourages them to reduce the weight and size of all vehicles. As a result, according to a recent study by Graham, a 40percent increase in fuel economy would cause an additional 1,650 deaths and 8,500 serious injuries every year.
Of course, no technological innovation, let alone policy change is without certain costs.
The question is whether the safety costs of a dramatic increase in CAFE standards are significant enough to outweigh the potential environmental benefits of a higher CAFE standard?
Some activists argue that higher CAFE standards are needed to reduce vehicle emissions of "greenhouse gases" and the risk of potential climate change from excessive accumulation of those gases.
CAFE supporters say higher fuel economy will reduce gasoline consumption and cut carbon emissions. One group, the Sierra Club, even claims that it's the "single biggest step" the U.S. can take to avoid climate disaster. But simple analysis shows such claims don't hold up.
Global warming theories are controversial, but it's clear that U.S. autos have only a marginal impact at most.
All fossil fuel-burning activities (driving cars, trucks, buses; flying planes; operating factories and utilities) generate carbon dioxide, a harmless gas that is also found extensively in nature.
Simply put, global warming (if it is a reality) is a global problem, calling for global responses. That makes it very different from air pollution problems, such as smog, that are regional in nature.
But for greenhouse gases, it's not important how or where the gases are generated; what matters is the total in the global atmosphere. And in fact, the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gases are in developing countries, such as China and India, not the United States.
The analysis puts the rhetoric into perspective, and shatters the case for CAFE as a meaningful response to global warming. In fact, the government's own data show that U.S. cars and light trucks (the only vehicles subject to CAFE) are responsible for only 1.5 percent of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions.
So even if a drastic 40percent increase in fuel economy standards actually reduce gasoline consumption substantially, the impact on global greenhouse gases would be less than four-tenths of one percent. That's hardly an effective response.
Also, contrary to what many people seem to believe, getting more miles to the gallon does not help to reduce air pollution.
All new cars must meet the same strict anti-pollution standards, regardless of their fuel economy ratings. So, a full-sized model is just as clean as a sub-compact. U.S. air quality has improved dramtically over the past two decades. Today, the major auto-related contributors to smog are older, poorly maintained vehicles, and traffic congestion - not clean-burning, late model cars and light trucks.
Nonetheless, the U.S. Department of Transportation has already set in motion a process to tighten standards for new pickup trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles over the next decade. And a global warming presidential advisory panel, which met this past week, is considering further increases, including higher mandates for new cars.
It's nearly impossible not to recognize the ironies that are shaping up around the debate over a drastic CAFE measure. Environmental activists, who regularly fight for extremely strict health and safety standards, regardless of cost, are now endorsing a measure that will kill and injure thousands of Americans each year.
And the Clinton administration, which has talked about containing health care costs, hasn't considered that auto crashes already cost $14.2 billion per year in health care costs, $4 billion of which is paid with public funds. Yet higher CAFE standards will only add to the number of motorists whose travels end up in hospital emergency rooms.
The bottom line is that the new CAFE increases are not a policy that works for America or for our environment.
The only real question is whether Americans will reject a measure that endangers lives and does almost nothing to protect the environment. **** Deadly Cars? The number of occupant deaths in 1993 per million registered vehicles that are 1-3 years old.

Abstract: Ottawa will dip into a $300-million fund to buy the licences of thousands of East Coast fishermen left without work because of the collapse of some stocks. Ottawa is aiming for a 50 per cent cut in the industry's capacity for catching fish. Cuts will be engineered by four newly created boards, including one in Quebec, federal Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin said yesterday. Richard Cashin, head of Newfoundland's board, said fishermen could be paid a minimum of $100,000 to forever surrender papers that provide access to fish.

Full text: Gas Tax Only One Option: Minister
Canada's natural resources minister said it's premature to say a new gasoline tax is being considered to help pay for anti-pollution measures. Anne McLellan said yesterday a two-cent-a-litre tax on gasoline at the pump is one of 88 recommendations now being considered by a joint industry-government task force. The recommendation, which says the tax money would go into a special environmental fund, is contained in a draft report from the Climate Change Task Force. The final report is expected soon. The minister conceded a final plan must be complete within six months - in time for an international meeting on so-called greenhouse gas emissions.
Confed Life Subject Of U.S. Suit
A jurisdictional fight has broken out over a class action suit launched in the United States against fallen Confederation Life Insurance Co. for, among other things, misrepresenting its financial health. A spokesman for Confederation Life's U.S. operations said yesterday that lawyers for court-appointed rehabilitator Palmieri and Co., will deal with the matter in due course. However, the spokesman added the Michigan court that put the U.S. operations into rehabilitation stayed all litigation against the company during the rehabilitation period. The company was seized by regulators in Canada and the United States on Aug. 11. But the lawyer for a New Jersey doctor who initiated the class action last June said that since the action was filed in U.S. Federal Court, it will be up to this court to decide whether the action will proceed. The plaintiffs, Dr. Allen Glushakow and his wife Shelley Glushakow, are alleging Confederation Life and a number of related parties, including the company's auditors, misrepresented the state of its financial health to them and other U.S. purchasers of its whole- life insurance policies. The suit also questions the company's sales practices.
Ottawa Plans Smaller Fishery
Ottawa will dip into a $300-million fund to buy the licences of thousands of East Coast fishermen left without work because of the collapse of some stocks. Ottawa is aiming for a 50 per cent cut in the industry's capacity for catching fish. Cuts will be engineered by four newly created boards, including one in Quebec, federal Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin said yesterday. Richard Cashin, head of Newfoundland's board, said fishermen could be paid a minimum of $100,000 to forever surrender papers that provide access to fish.
"It would be hard to imagine any under $100,000," said Cashin. Over the next few months, the boards will determine exactly how the scheme will work, but Ottawa will finalize the buyouts. Tobin promised to set up the boards last April within weeks of announcing a $1.9-billion aid program for about 30,000 fishermen and plant workers affected by declines in bottom-dwelling groundfish like northern cod. The $300 million was set aside then.

Healthy NDP remains vital for building equitable society: [SA2 Edition]

Author: David Crane Toronto Star

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/healthy-ndp-remains-vital-building-equitable/docview/437072733/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Where the NDP has gone off course, [Lars Osberg] argues in his paper that will be distributed at the NDP conference, is that it has strayed from the need to create wealth as well as to distrib-ute it: "Much of the original Progressive/CCF agenda was about eliminating the irrationalities of capitalism and improving economic efficiency - about generating wealth as well as sharing it." This original agenda also emphasized building communities, not simply pursuing individualism, and developing the idea of "a common future of shared rights and responsibilities." In recent years, Osberg argues, "the NDP has not tended to emphasize efficiency or responsibility. It has talked of how it will share wealth more equitably, rather than how its policies will create wealth - in the public mind, it has become identified more with policies that are fair than with policies that are practical." If, as it is widely believed, the market economy has won the day, the need for a credible and forward-looking NDP is even more important to protect Canadians from all the insecurity and inequality that flows from unrestrained capitalism. Left to its own devices, the free market won't solve the tragic problem of child poverty, save the world's environment or provide full employment. The job of the NDP is to bring humanity and fairness to the marketplace - in the process improving both equity and efficiency.

Full text: THIS weekend, members of the New Democratic Party are gathering in Ottawa as part of the process of rethinking their party's future.
What they decide is important for all Canadians because we need a political party that pushes from the left if we are to continue to build an equitable and humane country.
Indeed, Canadians will suffer from the lack of an effective NDP presence in the current Parliament as MPs debate the future direction of the economy, the reform of our social safety net, how to deal with the pension system, what kind of information highway we should have, the type of training and retraining systems we need, Canadian cultural policies, the reshaping of government, the jobs of the future and a host of other issues.
In the absence of a strong NDP, the Liberals are likely to be pulled increasingly to the right by Reform, erasing many of the differences between themselves and the Mulroney government they replaced - and giving ordinary Canadians another lesson in political disillusionment in the process.
To be sure, the plight of the NDP is largely its own fault. It has spent the past decade or longer spending too much time trying to be all things to all people and too little time actually thinking about its principles and priorities in a much different new, global economy.
Yet what the NDP does this weekend is not just an internal matter.
"Policy renewal for the NDP is crucial for Canada because the New Democratic Party is the custodian of a political heritage, dating back to the CCF and the Progressive movement, which has been crucially important in making Canada a better place in which to live," argues Lars Osberg, an economist from Dalhousie University.
While many people proclaim the victory of capitalism and the market economy, Osberg responds that "an unrestrained capitalist market system generates too much exploitation and unfairness, too much poverty and inequality and too much economic insecurity for the majority of families."
A key role of the NDP is to remind us, as Osberg contends, that "this is not inevitable" in a world in which capitalism, left to itself, "generates great wealth at the cost of great irrationalities and vast inequities."
A comparison of social conditions in Canada and the United States underlines the importance of policies to reduce inequality and enhance the social community.
Similarly, health studies in Sweden showing that the over-all health of Swedish children at the bottom 10 per cent of family income levels is the same as children at the top 10 per cent is a remarkable contrast to the free market system of the United States.
Likewise, the market system is not good at dealing with environmental problems, especially truly long-term issues such as global warming and climate change. The role of government intervention, especially through economic instruments such as tradable emission permits or carbon taxes, is to alter relative prices so that needed changes take place.
Where the NDP has gone off course, Osberg argues in his paper that will be distributed at the NDP conference, is that it has strayed from the need to create wealth as well as to distrib-ute it: "Much of the original Progressive/CCF agenda was about eliminating the irrationalities of capitalism and improving economic efficiency - about generating wealth as well as sharing it." This original agenda also emphasized building communities, not simply pursuing individualism, and developing the idea of "a common future of shared rights and responsibilities."
In fact, one of the greatest mistakes the NDP has made is not to underline the key fact that efficiency and equity go together.
Quality education and child care available to all children has a huge economic payoff. Medicare provides better health for Canadians and at lower cost than the U.S. private health insurance system, with economic benefits for Canada in addition to the lower costs. Effective retraining programs reduce social welfare costs and create a more productive work force.
Ontario Premier Bob Rae has shown some recognition of the linkages between the social environment and economic growth by merging the Premier's councils on the economy and on social policy into one council.
But in recent years, Osberg argues, "the NDP has not tended to emphasize efficiency or responsibility. It has talked of how it will share wealth more equitably, rather than how its policies will create wealth - in the public mind, it has become identified more with policies that are fair than with policies that are practical."
Perhaps even more than other political parties, the NDP should have a huge stake in wealth creation, to provide the means to support its social ambitions; in individual responsibility, to create the sense of community that should be the basis of Canadian society; and in government efficiency, to give credibility to the idea that government can do things well.
If, as it is widely believed, the market economy has won the day, the need for a credible and forward-looking NDP is even more important to protect Canadians from all the insecurity and inequality that flows from unrestrained capitalism. Left to its own devices, the free market won't solve the tragic problem of child poverty, save the world's environment or provide full employment. The job of the NDP is to bring humanity and fairness to the marketplace - in the process improving both equity and efficiency.

Extreme Waves: Surf's up Jon Reeds asks why oceanographers are all at sea about those rare freak extreme waves

Author: Reeds, Jon

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/extreme-waves-surfs-up-jon-reeds-asks-why/docview/293497151/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Extreme waves are a product of storms like those which raged for three months in the North Atlantic in the autumn of 1934. Sailors who survived them brought home tales of 100ft waves, perhaps like the one which hit the collier Ainderby 500 miles off Newfoundland. After six days of struggling west through gathering storms, she had hove to, only to be run down by a mast high wave which stoved in a bulkhead and a hatch, and washed away most of her bridge. One hundred and fifty miles to the east, the grain ship Millpool could not answer the Ainderby's distress calls. Already damaged by huge waves and running before the storm, she too was smashed by a huge wave and gradually her own distress calls faded. Although the Ainderby survived the terrible night and limped back to Swansea, the Millpool and her 26 crew vanished without trace. So too did three other ships that autumn, and two more lost their superstructures to huge waves. Both problems bedevil extreme wave study. The very long-term data needed is mostly lacking and the statistical framework for prediction is shaky. Swell is less important in extreme wave creation, which depends more on extreme wind speed. It all pointed the need for urgent research on waves and storms.

Full text: FREAK WAVES are the real monsters of the deep. Towering up to 30m above a storm-tossed sea, they have all too often meant the end for seafarers down the centuries. Because they are by definition rare and unpredictable, oceanographers (who prefer the term `extreme waves') are cautious in theorising about them. But a slowly flowing tide of evidence from the North Atlantic suggests they are becoming more of a threat.
If this is true, it is bad news for sailors. But through the ocean's sharpest teeth oceanographers may hear answers to some crucial questions - how waves, storms and storm surges are related, how they have changed and, most excitingly, whether there are clear signs that global warming is having demonstrable local effects.
The European Union is backing its interest with funds for major new research which aims to answer these key questions.
Deep sea sailors rightly fear extreme waves. Yachtsmen have faced this doorway to Davy Jones's locker down the centuries, and even today large vessels vanish without trace, and piracy, sabotage and structural failure cannot explain them all.
Extreme waves are a product of storms like those which raged for three months in the North Atlantic in the autumn of 1934. Sailors who survived them brought home tales of 100ft waves, perhaps like the one which hit the collier Ainderby 500 miles off Newfoundland. After six days of struggling west through gathering storms, she had hove to, only to be run down by a mast high wave which stoved in a bulkhead and a hatch, and washed away most of her bridge.
One hundred and fifty miles to the east, the grain ship Millpool could not answer the Ainderby's distress calls. Already damaged by huge waves and running before the storm, she too was smashed by a huge wave and gradually her own distress calls faded. Although the Ainderby survived the terrible night and limped back to Swansea, the Millpool and her 26 crew vanished without trace. So too did three other ships that autumn, and two more lost their superstructures to huge waves.
That year was exceptional, but there are signs that the north-east Atlantic is getting rougher. Britain's Institute of Oceanographic Science has gathered clear evidence that its average wave heights have increased over the last 30 years.
Scientists are divided over the reason. Some blame the greenhouse effect; others say it is a cyclical change. A third group cites chaos theory, and says that wave climates are the products of a rich interconnection of forces, which are too complex to permit simple causal explanations.
Waves are created by the wind. Yet although North Atlantic waves are showing a clear increase in average height, long term wind statistics show no corresponding increase in speed. Marine consultant Neil Hogben believes the answer lies in the swell, the term oceanographers use to describe ocean waves which can travel hundreds of miles beyond the wind field which created them.
`Wind speeds have not increased, but it seems storm frequencies have,' says Hogben. `Therefore the time interval allowing swells to decay has been reduced.' Storms are a key challenge for climate change theory. At mid-latitudes they are driven by the difference in temperature between equatorial and polar regions. The early work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested that, as the poles would warm faster than the equator, this gradient would be reduced and storms with it. The theory is proving controversial.
`Storminess is such a variable parameter one is hard put to say whether it has changed,' says wave statistician David Carter.
Whatever the long-term statistics, the last five years have seen a relentless procession of storms advance into northern waters. Norway, at the cutting edge of Atlantic gales and economically dependent on off-shore oil, has logged some dreadful conditions in the Barents and Norwegian seas. Between 1989 and 1993, these inhospitable waters came under unprecedented attack. Record low atmospheric pressures in early 1989 saw significant wave heights (the scientific measure of the average) up to 13m.
A storm the following December saw significant wave heights of 16m recorded at the Frigg oil field and a monster 26.4m extreme wave logged. October 1991 brought 13m significant waves to Haltenbanken in central Norway, a shocked light- house keeper describing them as the worst conditions he had seen in 40 years. Then January 1992 brought hurricane force winds recalling England's 1987 Great Storm, whipping up 14m seas.
There was worse to come. The three months following Christmas 1992 washed away all the records.
In mid-Norway waves averaged 5.2m for the whole three months, never falling below 2m. For five January days, the angry seas averaged over 8m, peaking at 13.6m in central Norway and bringing records of 14m and 16m off thenorth coast. Meanwhile a low pressure area deepened to 916 hPa off north west Scotland, a record for the northern hemisphere.
But however clear the upward trend in average heights, extreme waves are more elusive. Yet with the oil industry getting jumpy and a nervous insurance industry facing extreme weather of its own making, questions are being asked.
Last year Norway's environment ministry brought oceanographers from both sides of the Atlantic to a conference in Reykjavik to ask if extreme waves are getting bigger. Ominously, the scientists from both sides of the ocean compared notes and agreed that they are. In many places `one in one hundred years' estimated wave levels have been exceeded by several metres, and not just once. They concluded this is a genuine trend and not just the difficulties of prediction or the lack of long-term statistics.
Both problems bedevil extreme wave study. The very long-term data needed is mostly lacking and the statistical framework for prediction is shaky. Swell is less important in extreme wave creation, which depends more on extreme wind speed. It all pointed the need for urgent research on waves and storms.
A new study backed by the EU's Environment Programme is just getting underway. Research institutes in eight countries will examine the storm climate in the north-east Atlantic over the past 100 years to see if storms are becoming more frequent or intense. It will seek to establish causal links between storms, waves and storm surges and link the data in with existing models of climate change to begin to unlock some of the key questions about the future.
The two-year project will be coordinated by the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg. Norway, outside the EU, will be paying its own way into the project. The UK will be represented by the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory at Bidston, which will contribute its expertise on storm surges. Along with waves and storms, these complex interactions of sea and atmosphere, such as the one which produced the devastating east coast floods in 1993, are a vital element of the study.
Collecting long-term data presents a number of problems. The climate undergoes complex changes naturally and man-made effects may be hard to distinguish. Meteorological data sets going back decades or even centuries are available but changes in observational techniques may make them useless for long term comparison.
Some of the best data are of sea levels themselves and of air pressure. Wind speed data is rarely available and, where wave climate figures exist, they tend to be short-term, so statistical reconstruction is needed.
`The project will try to see whether there have been changes in trends, particularly in wave conditions over the last hundred years,' says Graham Alcock, a principal scientific officer at the Proudman Laboratory.
The most tantalising opportunity offered by the project will be hooking this long-term data into the Max Planck Institute's climate model already used to produce some of the IPCC predictions on climate change. As well as improving the model, it may allow the possibility of sub-global predictions. The results should help inform the next round IPCC reports due late next year.
A separate project, Neptune, backed by a different EU programme is also looking at the interaction of waves and storminess. By concentrating on more local results, it should help inform designers of coastal structures, where wave climates are very different to the deep seas.
If storm and wave parameters really are moving out of the natural variations it could provide powerful evidence of the effect mankind is having on the environment.
If storm frequency and intensity are both increasing, it is bad news for all who sail or work on the sea. Terrifying as extreme waves are, it is the demonstrable reality of higher average waves which provides the real challenge for designers of off-shore structures or ships. Just a 10 per cent increase in average stress can halve the fatigue life of such structures.
But it will be the bigger questions that the world at large will watch. Recent work in America suggests the IPCC's optimism about mid latitiude storms may be premature. Cloud reflectivity may fall with temperature, allowing the tropics to warm as fast as the poles.
It is too early yet to make storm warnings a permanent feature of ocean climatology. But a rougher future now looks inevitable.

Oil Slick: Profits Abroad And Poison at Home; Big Petroleum Ships Out, Leaving Behind a Big Mess: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: Meanwhile, major U.S. oil companies have been shutting down or selling off old U.S. oil properties. Last year, Mobil closed 10 product storage terminals, sold four pipeline systems and cut its U.S. marine fleet by one third. Exxon has sold $1.1 billion worth of U.S. assets in the last two years.

True, environmental regulations are less stringent abroad - in fact, nonexistent in some countries. But should that become the global standard? In the United States, oil and gas interests already have specific exemptions or exclusions in at least nine federal environmental laws. The Superfund law mandating cleanup of toxic wastes, for example, does not cover petroleum. These exclusions - many obtained in the 1970s - have made possible what amounts to two decades of unregulated activity and toxic pollution. The American people are now paying dearly for this lack of regulation in expensive cleanups and rising public health costs. Meanwhile, in the United States, pipelines are leaking, tank farms are seeping and two-thirds of the oil ever discovered here is still in the ground. In fact, without even considering oil shale or tar sands, there is more oil to be extracted and discovered in the domestic U.S. onshore - more than twice as much under some scenarios of price and technology - than there is in the entire federal U.S. offshore and Alaskan regions combined. And fixing the leaks and capturing the inefficiencies in the U.S. oil system today would exceed the energy equivalent of Australia's annual petroleum consumption - about 263 million barrels.

Full text: FOR THE last five years the U.S. oil industry has been spending more of its production dollars abroad than it has at home. Companies such as Amoco, Chevron and Phillips are now earmarking 60 to 75 percent of their exploration and production budgets for operations abroad. Meanwhile, at home the oil companies have been selling off production fields, shutting down refineries and laying off workers. More than 500,000 oil jobs have been cut since 1982, at least 130 oil refineries have closed and an estimated $20 billion worth of oil property will come on the market in the next five years.
As Big Oil heads abroad, it is leaving behind a giant oil mess, the cost of which is becoming more apparent every day:
- The Environmental Protection Agency estimates the cost of cleaning up groundwater contaminated by petroleum will run about $790 million a year.
- The cost of plugging 22,500 abandoned wells on public lands will exceed $300 million, according to the inspector general of the U.S. Department of the Interior.
- Texas auditors estimate the cost of cleaning up leaking underground storage tanks in the state will be about $2.5 billion and could take 38 years at current funding levels.
- New York officials say well-plugging liability in their state is between $35 million and $100 million.
Oil, it is often forgotten, is a toxic substance, containing three dangerous chemicals: benzene, toluene and xylene. Benzene is a known human carcinogen and chronic exposure can cause leukemia. Toluene can cause mutations in living cells and can damage a developing fetus. It can also damage the liver, kidney, brain and bone marrow. Chronic exposure to xylene may damage the liver, kidneys, skin, eyes and bone marrow as well as developing fetuses. Citizens living near gas stations, storage terminals and refineries - as well as workers - are especially at risk, often exposed to higher levels of petroleum emissions and pollutants.
The problem, in part, is a leaky infrastructure. America's vast and sprawling oil empire - some 650,000 wells, 220,000 miles of pipelines, 2,500 marketing terminals, 700,000 above-ground storage tanks, 200 refineries and more - is aging and in disrepair. Oil, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel and petrochemicals are leaking out of the system in supertanker proportions. Every year, in fact, the energy equivalent of at least 1,000 Exxon Valdez oil spills, roughly 11 billion gallons, is leaked, spilled, evaporated, thrown out, used inefficiently or otherwise dissipated somewhere in the U.S. oil system.
According to the American Petroleum Institute, floating gasoline or other leaked hydrocarbon is found in groundwater beneath 357 oil facilities in the United States. Near Charlotte, N.C., residents living near a gasoline tank farm where 17 wells have been contaminated have a leukemia rate double that of normal. In Newell, W. Va., a foot of petroleum has been found on groundwater beneath a Quaker State refinery. In California, massive leaks in 28 separate locations have been found beneath a Unocal oil field where a petroleum thinner used to recover heavy crude has leaked out of pipes and storage tanks over the last 40 years.
The investment - or disinvestment - policies of the major oil companies are no small part of the leaky infrastructure problem. During the go-go 1980s, capital goods replacement and plant maintenance were not top priorities in the oil industry. On Wall Street, merger mania was the rule of the day, and Big Oil went prospecting. Chevron bought Gulf, Mobil bagged Superior, and Texaco went after Getty. Exxon bought up billions of dollars worth of its own stock. Unocal and Phillips borrowed heavily to defend themselves from corporate raiders. Enormous debt piled up, and in 1986 the collapse of oil prices made matters worse.
Soon, the debt service and profit pressures pushed management to cost-cutting and "restructuring." Seasoned employees were let go. Exxon alone cut 40,000 during the 1980s. Untrained, unskilled and less expensive contract workers were used to fill the gaps. Debt was paid down, gasoline was refined and the petrochemicals kept coming - but not without a price.
Between 1983 and 1992, fires and explosions at U.S. oil refineries and petrochemical plants killed more than 80 workers, injured 900 and caused thousands to be evacuated from nearby communities. The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union charged that many of the accidents were "linked {to} drastic reductions in the resources devoted to plant maintenance." Shell and Phillips, among other companies, were cited by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration for inadequate maintenance in fatal explosions during 1988-89. After Exxon's string of spills and refinery mishaps in 1989-90, even Wall Street began to wonder if the company's restructuring hadn't gone too far.
Meanwhile, major U.S. oil companies have been shutting down or selling off old U.S. oil properties. Last year, Mobil closed 10 product storage terminals, sold four pipeline systems and cut its U.S. marine fleet by one third. Exxon has sold $1.1 billion worth of U.S. assets in the last two years.
Chevron is selling off what it calls "marginal" oil and gas properties, hundreds of which were acquired in the 1984 takeover of Gulf Oil. In all, some 1,200 oil and gas properties are planned to be sold by 1995 - prop that one senior Chevron official called "garbage." Chevron is also selling one-third of its U.S. refining capacity and more than 800 gas stations, using the proceeds to help pay for its overseas operations, such as its joint venture with Kazakhstan. Booming oil growth is already raging in many developing economies and is expected to pick up even more by the year 2000.
Back home, however, U.S. oilmen are quick to blame environmental regulations as the reason they are shutting down and heading abroad. True, environmental regulations are less stringent abroad - in fact, nonexistent in some countries. But should that become the global standard? In the United States, oil and gas interests already have specific exemptions or exclusions in at least nine federal environmental laws. The Superfund law mandating cleanup of toxic wastes, for example, does not cover petroleum. These exclusions - many obtained in the 1970s - have made possible what amounts to two decades of unregulated activity and toxic pollution. The American people are now paying dearly for this lack of regulation in expensive cleanups and rising public health costs.
Yet, as Big Oil heads abroad, American taxpayers are helping them go. In Russia, U.S. oil companies are receiving U.S. aid to produce oil. In September, the Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC), a federal agency, approved loan guarantees and insurance worth $28 million to Texaco. The company will restore production at 150 idle oil wells in the Sutormin fields of Western Siberia. Last May, Conoco received aid from OPIC for a smaller project.
"Texaco and all these other companies have on line projects that will cost multibillion dollars," explained an OPIC spokesman. "The administration has decided it's important for the U.S. to provide assistance to U.S. companies to help the former Soviet Union become a developed economy."
Meanwhile, in the United States, pipelines are leaking, tank farms are seeping and two-thirds of the oil ever discovered here is still in the ground. In fact, without even considering oil shale or tar sands, there is more oil to be extracted and discovered in the domestic U.S. onshore - more than twice as much under some scenarios of price and technology - than there is in the entire federal U.S. offshore and Alaskan regions combined. And fixing the leaks and capturing the inefficiencies in the U.S. oil system today would exceed the energy equivalent of Australia's annual petroleum consumption - about 263 million barrels.
An "oil boom" is possible in America, only this time the dollars must be invested in efficiency, new technology, environmental protection and worker training.
On one level, the oil industry is a very sophisticated technological player. Amazing feats of production are demonstrated daily almost anywhere in the world. Offshore oil platforms are engineering and technological marvels. Yet when it comes to efficiency and pollution prevention, the oil industry is laggard in its technologies.
Some industrial hazard analysts, such as Nicholas Ashford at MIT, point out that existing accident prevention systems are grounded in "secondary prevention" - measures that reduce the probability of accidents but do not really change the inherent risks associated with those technologies or processes. Ashford and others suggest that the industry should move to a new level of safety and plant design - known as "primary prevention" or "inherently safe technology," also applicable to the prevention of leaks, spills and emissions.
A few industry leaders have discovered that the necessary changes need not be all that earthshaking and can have multiple benefits.
"{W}e set out to improve stationary combustion safety at our refineries," reported British Petroleum's James Ross in a 1991 speech to petroleum analysts in Toronto. "The solution was to develop a new burner. This new burner not only increased safety, it also reduced nitrogen dioxide and particulate emissions - and it provided a material improvement in efficiency. We now also provide that technology to our customers."
Certainly in America - which now purports to lead the world in stabilizing greenhouse gases - oil profligacy and oil waste must end in all forms, especially within the oil industry itself.
But how does this process begin?
President Clinton should publicly challenge the oil industry to clean up its waste, repair the infrastructure and improve operating efficiencies capable of "backing out" millions of barrels of imported oil - now at record levels.
Congress should live up to its regulatory responsibilities and repeal the oil and gas exemptions found throughout the nation's environmental laws. Tax writers should abolish the write-off allowed oil companies for expensing oil spill cleanups and property damage. Double hulls should be required on the nation's 30,000 oil barges. Oil pipelines should have automatic shut-off valves and improved leak-detection systems. And aboveground storage tanks should have double bottoms.
As long as oil must be used - and the prospect of global climate change makes urgent the need to develop non-fossil alternatives - oil producers and oil refiners must be held to a higher standard of efficiency: no waste, no pollution, no endangerment. The petroleum system, in transition to whatever comes next, must perform to a new level of operational and environmental integrity. The free ride for oil should be free no more.

Today, the plans have been scaled back to three new Doppler radars and two upgrades, already completed.

Full text: The warning was unequivocal: "There is no question there is a resource crisis within AES, and particularly within the Weather Services Program.
Translated from bureaucratese, those words mean that you and your property aren't being protected from severe weather as much as Canada's weather experts believe desirable.
The warning is contained in an internal audit of the Atmospheric Environment Service (AES), the biggest component of the federal Environment Department and what used to be called the Canadian Meteorological Service. The audit was published in January 1993, but only recently made available to The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.
Because the audit was based, in part, on information from 1991, some Environment Department officials have deprecated its bleak view as dated. In fact, in the most critical area, the status today is even bleaker than the 1992 audit.
That issue is the provision of a network of radar stations that can spot developing storms earlier, known as Doppler radar. Doppler radar is considered essential by meteorologists for timely warning of severe weather, like tornadoes and blizzards, and for the most accurate aviation forecasting. The continental United States will be covered by a network of Doppler radars by the end of this decade.
Once, the Atmospheric Environment Service had similar plans for Canada, with a proposed network of 20 stations costing more than $33 million. By the 1993 audit, AES still planned a first phase of eight new Doppler radars and five conversions of existing radars by 1999. Today, the plans have been scaled back to three new Doppler radars and two upgrades, already completed.
The "savings from the original plan are, according to the official department estimates, $14.5 million. But consider. The biggest category of insurance claim from the tornado that hit Edmonton in 1987, killing 25 and causing more than $300 million in damage, was for vehicles battered by hailstones and debris. How much would have been saved by a warning broadcast 10 minutes sooner, enough time to move vehicles under shelter? Maybe $14.5 million?
The root problem is that weather observation over such a huge country as Canada costs a bundle because it's still labor-intensive and a large number of collection points are necessary. But the Environment Department raised public expectations with the Green Plan. To finance sexy new environmental protection projects within a shrinking budget, the Environment Department's brass keeps nibbling away at the biggest budget, the modernization program to improve meteorological warnings.
The weather services have been struggling to maintain the costly observation and forecasting network -- pushing ahead with automation to cut labor costs, squeezing more information from existing radar observations to compensate for the cuts to the Doppler network, plugging a Prairie gap in the upper-air sounding network.
They've also taken on new jobs, such as the twice-daily production of a UV index, with a spin-off for a Saskatoon firm that developed the key piece of instrumentation. And they're looking for partnerships with private forecasters or specialized forecasting that would generate revenues, like predicting when the SkyDome will have to be closed.
But few are satisfied.
"There's no question that weather warnings are an important issue that we need to address more than we are at the present time, says Gordon McBean, the assistant deputy minister who heads AES.
To end on an encouraging note: AES has long had some of the world's most outstanding scientists and administrators. One of McBean's predecessors, Jim Bruce, is being given the highest honor of the World Meteorological Organization for his contributions to international work on climate change. And two AES scientists in Toronto are being honored for their work on ozone.

Full text:   LONDON -- Global warming has arrived and is costing the insurance industry billions of dollars as it forks out for ever more frequent natural disasters, according to a Greenpeace report.
A series of environmental catastrophes over the past four years amounts to irrefutable evidence of warming, says The Climate Time Bomb.
The report, which cites recent changes in polar ice sheets, sea temperature, storms, drought and flood damage, is the first attempt to prove global warming is already threatening to undermine the economic health of the developed world.
The Greenpeace view is shared by some of the world's biggest reinsurance companies, including Peter Myer of the Swiss Reinsurance Co., which endorsed the report. Many reinsurance companies have gone out of business due to the sequence of disasters, and the trend has contributed to the huge losses at Lloyd's of London.
The executive vice-president of Tokyo Marine and Fire, Shiro Horichi, said: "The fact is that in recent years natural disasters whose return period used to be regarded as at least 100 years have transpired every year in various places in the world. It seems difficult to believe that these incidents are merely accidental.
The Association of British Insurers has increased its premiums to cover environmental damage -- but remains skeptical. A spokesman, Tony Baker, said: "We are aware of the concern, but our research over 200 to 300 years shows there is nothing significant going on over that time frame. In the interests of policy holders we are still studying emerging trends.
The report is timed to focus attention on the coming Geneva talks, at which the Climate Change Convention, signed two years ago by 167 nations, is due to be updated.
Under the original convention most of the developed world agreed to return carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. No provision was made for concerted political action after that date. Scientists had warned that to avert catastrophic climate changes, a 60-per-cent reduction in emissions was needed. But few countries were prepared to contemplate such a dramatic cut.
Jeremy Leggatt, director of science for the Greenpeace climate campaign, said global warming is a threat to the world economy: "Banks, the insurance industry, and pension funds are all threatened. If they begin to take this report seriously then we will see things happen.
The report describes how eight of the last 14 years were the hottest on record. It details higher sea temperatures that are killing coral reefs, intense forest fires, increasing drought, more hurricane-type storms, diseases spreading from hotter regions, and a rise in insect pests.
Asked about other scientific reports claiming global warming was bunk, Leggatt said: "It reminds me of the early days of the anti-smoking campaign.
"For every scientist saying smoking was harmful there was one paid by the tobacco industry saying there was no evidence. The fossil-fuel lobby is doing the same today with global warming."

Abstract: GREENPEACE yesterday launched the world's first database of early warning signs for climate change - a long list of floods, storms, droughts and changes in wildlife, weather and ice and snow patterns which it believes are all indicators of man- made global warming. Jeremy Leggett, Greenpeace's director of science, said the report had been sent to the governments of 167 nations that had signed the United Nations climate protection treaty. "I challenge any of them to read the report and not feel the need for a new urgency in addressing this threat," he said. Greenpeace wants developed nations to cut their carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent by 2005 as a first step in tackling the problem. But the UN's climate change treaty only calls on them to stabilise emissions at their 1990 level by the year 2000.

Full text: GREENPEACE yesterday launched the world's first database of early warning signs for climate change - a long list of floods, storms, droughts and changes in wildlife, weather and ice and snow patterns which it believes are all indicators of man- made global warming.
The environmental pressure group claimed that there was now unshakeable evidence that pollution had begun to change the earth's climate and make the planet a more dangerous place.
The database has been published as a 166-page book called The Climate Time Bomb and the information will also be available on the computer network Internet.
Jeremy Leggett, Greenpeace's director of science, said the report had been sent to the governments of 167 nations that had signed the United Nations climate protection treaty. "I challenge any of them to read the report and not feel the need for a new urgency in addressing this threat," he said.
But some British researchers were unimpressed. "This is a collection of newspaper cuttings not worth the paper it is written on," said Dr Chris Folland, of the Meteorological Office's Hadley Centre in Bracknell, Berkshire, one of the world's leading centres of climate change expertise. "It's not scientific - the approach is not a valid one."
The Greenpeace report has 500 entries which include brief summaries of reports from pressure groups, scientists and governments, as well as hundreds of cases of extreme weather. Newspaper sources have been relied on heavily.
Greenpeace, which claims 5 million paying supporters worldwide, points out that:
- Eight of the last 14 years have been the hottest since world-wide temperature records began in the last century.
- In the last five years the insurance industry has been hard hit by 15 "billion dollar" climate-related disasters, including floods and hurricanes.
- Coral bleaching is killing Tahiti's reef systems - the latest in a world-wide surge of coral damage which some scientists believe is due to warmer sea temperatures.
Dr Leggett said that the insurance industry could be the first major casualty of man-made climate change and it was now starting to take the issue seriously. It had $160bn worth of reserves around the globe which could be exhausted in the aftermath of a series of hurricanes and floods. This "global insurance collapse" would threaten the world economy.
He accepted that it was in the nature of climate to be highly variable, and there would always be extremes around the world at any one time. "But what we are seeing now is a peculiar concentration in the number and intensity of events."
However, Dr Folland, while believing that man-made global warming could be a threat, said: "There always are extreme climate events happening. It's not yet possible to prove that the climate is becoming more variable."
There is a scientific consensus that rising emissions of pollutants, especially carbon dioxide and methane, are trapping more of the sun's heat in the atmosphere. This could alter rainfall and wind patterns as well as raising temperatures and sea levels.
But the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which gathers together top scientists in the field, believes there will be no unequivocal proof for about 10 years that the climate is changing. By then the planet will be committed to further change.
Greenpeace wants developed nations to cut their carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent by 2005 as a first step in tackling the problem. But the UN's climate change treaty only calls on them to stabilise emissions at their 1990 level by the year 2000.

Full text: GLOBAL warming has already arrived and is costing the insurance industry billions of pounds as it forks out for ever more frequent natural disasters, according to a Greenpeace report launched yesterday.
The series of environmental catastrophes over the past four years amounts to irrefutable evidence of warming, says The Climate Time Bomb.
The report, which cites recent changes in polar ice sheets, sea temperature, storms, drought and flood damage, is the first attempt to prove global warming is already threatening to undermine the economic health of the developed world.
The Greenpeace view is shared by some of the world's biggest reinsurance companies, including Dr Peter Myer of the Swiss Reinsurance Company, which endorsed the report. Many reinsurance companies have gone out of business due to the sequence of disasters, and the trend has contributed to the huge losses at Lloyd's of London.
The executive vice president of Tokyo Marine and Fire, Shiro Horichi, said: "The fact is that in recent years natural disasters whose return period used to be regarded as at least 100 years have transpired every year in various places in the world. It seems difficult to believe that these incidents are merely accidental."
The Association of British Insurers has increased its premiums to cover environmental damage - but remains sceptical. A spokesman, Tony Baker, said: "We are aware of the concern, but our research over 200 to 300 years shows there is nothing significant going on over that time frame. In the interests of policy holders we are still studying emerging trends."
The report is timed to focus attention on the coming Geneva talks where the Climate Change Convention, signed in Rio two years ago by 167 nations, is due to be updated.
Under the original convention most of the developed world agreed to return carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. No provision was made for concerted political action after that date. Scientists had warned that to avert catastrophic climate changes, a 60 per cent reduction in emissions was needed. But few countries were prepared to contemplate such a dramatic cut.
Greenpeace is sending its report to all the countries involved in the talks, hoping to jolt them into action.
Dr Jeremy Leggatt, the director of science for the Greenpeace climate campaign, said global warming was a threat to the world economy: "Banks, the insurance industry, and pension funds are all threatened. If they begin to take this report seriously then we will see things happen."
The report describes how eight of the last 14 years were the hottest on record. It details higher sea temperatures which are killing coral reefs, intense forest fires, increasing drought, more hurricane-type storms, diseases spreading from hotter regions, and a rise in insect pests.
Asked about the many alternative scientific reports claiming global warming was bunk, Dr Leggatt said: "It reminds me of the early days of the anti-smoking campaign. For every scientist saying smoking was harmful there was one paid by the tobacco industry saying there was no evidence. The fossil fuel lobby is doing the same today with global warming. Let us not forget that governments accept global warming is a danger and a fact. What we are saying is: 'Let's have some action' ."

Violent weather vexes experts; Climatologists baffled as to cause of past two years of battering: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: Around the world, the 1980s and early 1990s were remarkable for the "frequency and intensity of extremes of weather and climate," Dr. John Houghton, a co-chairman of an international group of scientists advising the United Nations on climate change, says in Global Warming: The Complete Briefing (Lion Publishing, Oxford, England, 1994). This curvier pattern allows colder, wetter weather to plunge down into the Northeast and warmer, drier weather to thrust upward into the West. The jet stream broke sharply from a flatter pattern in the late 1950s and the curvy pattern has predominated ever since, according to studies by Daniel Leathers of the University of Delaware and Michael Palecki of the State University of New York at Buffalo. The changes in ocean temperature touch off long-distance atmospheric chain reactions that alter patterns of air circulation and often bring drought or excessive rains to various parts of the world. El Nino, the warming phase of the cycle, is believed to have been a factor in causing last year's floods in the U.S. Midwest.

Full text:   The extreme weather of the past two years in North America is part of a worldwide pattern, scientists say, and they are searching hard for an explanation.
The United States suffered through Hurricane Andrew in August 1992, the most destructive American hurricane ever; the East Coast "storm of the century" in March 1993; the devastating flooding in the upper Midwest last summer; both the U.S. and Canada had to deal with the extra-cold summer that chilled the Northeast in 1992, and the seemingly unending snows and bitter cold of this past winter. While this was happening the West experienced record warmth.
Climatic swings over decade
All are part of a global pattern of sharper climatic swings over about the past decade, climatologists say.
Around the world, the 1980s and early 1990s were remarkable for the "frequency and intensity of extremes of weather and climate," Dr. John Houghton, a co-chairman of an international group of scientists advising the United Nations on climate change, says in Global Warming: The Complete Briefing (Lion Publishing, Oxford, England, 1994).
One tempting explanation for the extreme weather would be to ascribe it to the start of global warming, the feared climate change that could be brought about by emissions of heat-trapping industrial waste gases. Computer models of global climate predict more violent weather as the atmosphere heats up.
But most climatologists say the small amount of warming seen so far could well lie within the normal limits of the climate's variability. Whatever the cause of the warming, it may or may not be responsible for the recent climatic extremes, Houghton said: "We have no means of knowing, actually."
If global warming cannot be blamed for the recent blast of violent weather, scientists must turn to the usual suspects, such as the circulation of air currents, the positioning of storm systems and the distribution of heat and moisture.
These are the factors that determine weather on a local and regional scale, and the puzzle is to see if there is some new interconnection that has driven them to their recent round of assaults.
Although scientists have no definitive answers, they have had some clues. They have found, for instance, that some large-scale patterns of air circulation may come and go in a rough kind of cycle.
The average winter course of the North American jet stream, along which storms develop, has recently shifted from a relatively straight west-to-east path across the continent to a curvier one that dips south from the Pacific Northwest into the central part of the U.S. and then turns upward through the Middle Atlantic states.
This curvier pattern allows colder, wetter weather to plunge down into the Northeast and warmer, drier weather to thrust upward into the West. The jet stream broke sharply from a flatter pattern in the late 1950s and the curvy pattern has predominated ever since, according to studies by Daniel Leathers of the University of Delaware and Michael Palecki of the State University of New York at Buffalo.
Variations on the pattern are believed partly responsible both for last winter's many snowstorms in the Northeast and for a period of more intense northeasters in the Middle Atlantic states.
The pattern is itself linked to sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, and especially to the behavior of one of the globe's most powerful weather-makers: the cycle featuring El Nino, a quasi- periodic oscillation in which temperatures in the tropical Pacific rise above average, then fall below it over irregular periods of two to seven years.'
The changes in ocean temperature touch off long-distance atmospheric chain reactions that alter patterns of air circulation and often bring drought or excessive rains to various parts of the world. El Nino, the warming phase of the cycle, is believed to have been a factor in causing last year's floods in the U.S. Midwest.
El Nino events have become relatively more frequent in the past 15 to 20 years. Leathers and Palecki found that the curvy North American jet stream comes and goes in an approximate rhythm with them and other changes in Pacific sea surface temperatures.
Similar processes may be at work in other parts of the globe. But all of this amounts to a snippet of understanding, given the vast complexity of the climate system. What seems clearer is that the system has been serving up more extremes and greater variability over the past decade or so.
Houghton cites insurance-industry figures that show that the number of catastrophic windstorms worldwide in the 1980s was 29 - more than double the 14 of the 1970s, which had in turn increased from the eight of the 1960s. Insured losses from these storms have increased tenfold since the 1960s.
Some of the increase is related to more people living in the storm- struck areas, but much of it "seems to have arisen from the increased storminess in the late 1980s and early 1990s," Houghton said. Moreover, floods and droughts have been going to extremes as well, he said.
Some of the extreme weather may be linked to El Nino, Houghton, chief executive of the Meteorological Office of Britain until his retirement in 1991, and other climatologists say.
A 1982-83 El Nino event was one of the strongest on record and caused climatic devastation from California to South America to Australia. An unusually cold turn of the cycle, the opposite side of the coin that has been named La Nina, has been tied, though inconclusively, to both the Bangladesh floods and the Midwestern drought of 1988.
Protracted El Nino
And an especially protracted El Nino, lasting for three years and ending only in a few months ago, has been implicated, at least partly, in some of the more recent climatic behavior.
One obstacle to further understanding of weather cycles is that good records go back only to the 1940s, said Anthony Barnston, a senior analyst at the U.S. National Weather Service Climate Analysis Centre at Camp Springs, Md.
It could be, he said, that "it's run of the mill that we have these decade-to-decade changes in variability," but there is no good way to tell.

Violent Weather Battering Globe In Last 2 Years Baffles Experts

El Nino, the warming phase of the cycle, is believed to have been a factor in causing last year's Midwestern floods. Snippet of Understanding
El Nino events have become relatively more frequent in the last 15 to 20 years, and Dr. Leathers and Dr. Palecki found that the curvy North American jet stream comes and goes in an approximate rhythm with them and other changes in Pacific sea surface temperatures.
Similar processes may be at work in other parts of the globe. But all of this amounts to a snippet of understanding, given the vast complexity of the climate system. What seems clearer is that the system has been serving up more extremes and greater variability over the last decade or so.
Dr. Houghton cites insurance-industry figures that show that the number of catastrophic windstorms worldwide in the 1980's was 29 -- more than double the 14 of the 1970's, which had in turn increased from the 8 of the 1960's.

Some of the increase is related to more people living in the storm-struck areas, but much of it "seems to have arisen from the increased storminess in the late 1980's and early 1990's," Dr. Houghton says. Moreover, floods and droughts have been going to extremes as well, he says.
Some of the extreme weather may be linked to El Nino, Dr. Houghton, chief executive of the Meteorological Office of Britain until his retirement in 1991, and other climatologists say. A 1982-83 El Nino event was one of the strongest on record and caused climatic devastation from California to South America to Australia. An unusually cold turn of the cycle, the opposite side of the coin that has been named La Nina, has been tied, though inconclusively, to both the Bangladesh floods and the Midwestern drought of 1988. And an especially protracted El Nino, lasting for three years and ending only in the last few months, has been implicated, at least partly, in some of the more recent climatic behavior.
One obstacle to further understanding of weather cycles is that good records go back only to the 1940's, said Anthony Barnston, a senior analyst at the National Weather Service Climate Analysis Center at Camp Springs, Md. It could be, he said, that "it's run of the mill that we have these decade-to-decade changes in variability," but there is no good way to tell.
Some parts of the climate system, like the El Nino-La Nina cycle, vary on less than a decade's scale and are easier to analyze. Scientists have pinned down pretty well how the cycle affects weather in various parts of the globe through "teleconnections," or chains of cause and effect that ripple through the atmosphere as a result of tropical ocean warming or cooling. But they can only approximate when the cycle will turn, and sometimes, as with everyday weather predictions, they are wrong.
The chief reason is chaos, the inherent unpredictability of weather systems that thwarts attempts at long-range forecasts. Forecasters are attempting to deal with the chaos in the El Nino cycle by running many different computer simulations that predict a range of outcomes. If many of the outcomes are in a narrow cluster suggesting that an El Nino event is on the way, then that "tilts the roulette table" in favor of such a prediction, said Dr. Mark Cane of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, a pioneer in El Nino forecasting.
"If we had the tools we have now, we might have been able to say months or a year ahead that there was a better than even chance" of a strong El Nino in 1982 and 83, he said. "We could have said there's such a big tilt to the table" that people in areas affected by the climatic ripples emanating from El Nino should take precautions, he added.
Mr. Barnston said a slight majority of forecasters at the Climate Analysis Center believes that the tropical Pacific, after three years of warm El Nino conditions, is moving into a mild cold period characteristic of La Nina. That phase is usually associated with warm winters in the Southeastern United States, colder than normal winters from the Great Lakes to the Pacific Northwest, unsettled winters in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states and, maybe, summer drought in the country's midsection.
By changing the distribution of storms over the ocean, El Nino creates warmer conditions in the Western United States and cooler ones in the Northeast -- the exact pattern of last winter. This effect has tended to be more prevalent since about 1976, when a period of relatively more frequent El Nino events began, said Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a climate researcher at the Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. "What happened this past winter in some sense was another example that fits into that particular phase," he said.
Climatologists are only beginning to try to understand how all the factors influencing climate fit together. Many are sure, however, that global greenhouse warming, if and when it happens, will alter atmospheric circulation by creating heat imbalances on the planet's surface: the ocean warms more slowly than the land.
It cools more slowly, too, as when Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted in 1991, cooling the earth by casting aloft sulfate droplets that reflected sunlight. Some climate researchers believe this imbalance affected weather patterns by altering atmospheric circulation, but they have not yet pinned this down.
Many climatologists believe further that a warmer world will increase the evaporation of ocean water and thereby the number and intensity of storms. Floods, droughts and storms, in other words, would be the likely signature of global warming. And that violent regime could be triggered, some fear, by just a small warming of global climate.
But for now, climatologists are in a dense fog as to whether the current phase of violent weather is a harbinger of a warming planet or just a normal fluctuation of the global climate.

Abstract: THE extreme weather of the last two years in North America is part of a worldwide pattern, scientists say, and they are searching hard for an explanation. The United States has suffered through the extra-cold summer that chilled the Northeast in 1992; Hurricane Andrew in August 1992, the most destructive American hurricane ever; the East Coast "storm of the century" in March 1993; the devastating flooding in the upper Midwest last summer; and the seemingly unending snows of early 1994 in the Northeast, accompanied by record warmth in the West.

Full text: Getting a fix on carbon dioxide to fight global warming GREENHOUSE GASES / Ontario Hydro's proposal to buy a Costa Rican forest is just one international project springing up from the 1992 Rio accord
Saturday, May 21, 1994
The Globe and Mail THE City of Toronto has spent $200,000 to plant trees in Honduras, part of an effort to soak up some of the carbon-dioxide air pollution caused in Canada's largest metropolitan area.
The project has been quietly under way for a year, and will lead to the production of 600,000 seedlings this year for a deforested area of the Central American country.
Toronto's move, a controversy this week about Ontario Hydro's proposal to buy land in Costa Rica for the same purpose, experiments by TransAlta Corp. in Saskatchewan and a handful of initiatives by U.S. utilities are all fruit from the same seed, the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Signed in Rio de Janeiro almost exactly two years ago, the convention is a long-term international agreement designed to slow and eventually roll back production of greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming.
Scientific debate about the rate and impact of global warming continues, but in Rio the industrial world agreed to try to reduce the output of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide, to 1990 levels by 2000.
Canada produced more than 525 million tonnes of such gases in 1990. Coal-burning electrical power stations such as those run by Ontario Hydro, TransAlta and utilities in New Brunswick and Saskatchewan accounted for about 95 million tonnes, almost a fifth of the total.
(Gasoline and diesel cars and trucks are also major sources, and the ones in which individuals will notice changes as governments step up their efforts to meet the targets.) The Rio agreement contemplated international "offsets," in which a polluter in one country balances its greenhouse-gas production by arranging for reductions somewhere else.
The terms of such deals will be the subject of a multinational conference next year, but utilities are looking ahead, so one U.S. company is working to reduce emissions from a Central European plant, and Ontario Hydro is looking at the rain forest.
"They know the writing's on the wall," said Michel Gareau, a climate campaigner for the international environmental group Friends of the Earth.
Proposals like Hydro's, which would involve the purchase of a 12,500- hectare tract of rain forest on Costa Rica's Pacific coast, are based on the idea that growing trees convert carbon dioxide in the atmosphere into solid carbon - wood - thereby "fixing" it in an environmentally harmless form, at least until it is burned or decomposes.
Replanting once-forested farm fields with saplings will remove considerable carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as the trees mature. There might even be some reduction in carbon dioxide in mature forests.
A proposal such as Hydro's, to preserve an existing forest, may prevent the carbon from escaping into the atmosphere, depending on what happens to the trees. If they are cut for lumber to be used in houses or furniture, the carbon is locked in for an extended period. Paper products may release the carbon quickly, or, if the paper goes into a landfill, become a long- term "sink." And forests that are burned to clear the land for farming, as is common in the Third World, release their carbon all at once.
Hence the willingness of utilities to buy pieces of forest, especially fast-growing tropical rain forest, to get a jump on what is likely to become an increasingly tough regulatory structure.
Environment Canada, which is working with provinces and affected parties to develop a national plan for presentation to politicians this fall, said "the enhancement of sinks and reservoirs for greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide in particular - is key to Canada's climate-change response strategy."
But environmentalists and scientists are not completely sold on the idea. Some see it as a Band-Aid, and believe cutting emissions is the only real solution.
"We're really solidly against this," Mr. Gareau said. Rather than buying land in Central America, where supervision may be difficult, he suggests Hydro could do better by finding alternatives to diesel power on remote Indian reserves.
Lawrence Solomon of Toronto-based Energy Probe said the real solution is to stop subsidizing inefficient energy projects, such as Newfoundland's Hibernia offshore oil project, and increase competition by breaking up monopoly systems such as Ontario Hydro.
But for AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., an electrical utility with more than $500-million (U.S.) in annual sales and "fun, fairness, integrity and social responsibility" among its objectives, sequestration - locking carbon in trees - is a reality.
The company has in place three projects on which it has spent $7- million, said Sheryl Sturges, director of the AES greenhouse offset group.
In Guatemala it will help plant 40 to 50 million trees over a decade; in Paraguay it helped preservationists buy a park that is now a United Nations-recognized protected area, and along the Amazon, natives are fighting land-claim battles with AES money.
"We look on this as an insurance policy," Ms. Sturges said. As for Ontario Hydro, "I think they're being farsighted."

Abstract: Fifteen months into the Clinton administration, environmentalists are trying to figure out what hit them. With committed executive branch leadership for the first time in more than a decade, and large majorities of the public identifying themselves in polls as environmentalists, they had reason to expect a golden era. Instead, they are looking at a dismal legislative record with no immediate prospect of improvement. The once-controversial climate treaty was ratified so smoothly that few realize it happened. Deft handling turned industry opposition to the biodiversity treaty into support. The United States helped reform the World Bank's Global Environmental Facility so that it can contribute to it. The administration also has moved to address the crisis caused by drastic overfishing, strengthened the North American Free Trade Agreement's environmental provisions and is turning a roads-only transportation policy into one that recognizes the environmental, energy and congestion-reducing benefits of other modes of travel. Most important, its practice generally reflects its rhetoric that environmental/economic conflicts often can be resolved to mutual benefit when there is the will to do so. It may be too that we are in a transition period between the regulatory era and one in which economic signals will play a much greater role. Many of the easier tasks have been handled. Those that remain may require steps like removing subsidies, reflecting environmental costs in prices and using taxes to discourage environmental bads instead of economic goods like income and profits. Neither environmentalists nor the administration are ready to provide the leadership this new direction will demand.

Full text: Fifteen months into the Clinton administration, environmentalists are trying to figure out what hit them. With committed executive branch leadership for the first time in more than a decade, and large majorities of the public identifying themselves in polls as environmentalists, they had reason to expect a golden era. Instead, they are looking at a dismal legislative record with no immediate prospect of improvement.
The defeats began at the beginning - with the deficit-reduction plan. The proposed nine-cent energy tax, which would have been at least marginally beneficial, was cut to an environmentally meaningless 4.5 cents.
Also in the plan were proposals to cut subsidies of mining, water use, logging and grazing, but these were jettisoned when western senators balked. Objectionable on both fiscal and environmental grounds, the subsidies promote environmental mismanagement and distort markets at taxpayers' expense.
Congress has failed to take final action on any of the four proposed cuts. Water law reform is stymied. The mining law should soon go to House-Senate conference, but with uncertain outcome. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is doggedly pursuing grazing fee reform under his own authority, with little yet to show for a huge effort. The good news is that timber subsidies are shrinking even without a legislative mandate as the U. S. Forest Service reduces the cutting it allows.
The Senate was also unable to muster a majority for long-overdue reform of federal flood insurance, another fiscal and environmental sore spot. It makes taxpayers subsidize home building (often of expensive second homes) where no private insurer will pay - on flood plains and eroding beaches at high risk from storms and hurricanes - and then pays to rebuild after the inevitable disaster.
Six years after both parties endorsed elevating the Environmental Protection Agency to departmental status, legislation failed again this year. This time it was brought down by crippling takings amendments (which would require the government to pay every time it took an action that reduced the potential value of a property or business) and rigid risk assessment requirements that would undervalue anything that is uncertain or not easily expressed in monetary units (does anyone believe, for example, that future lost wages adequately capture the human cost of lost IQ due to a toxic exposure?).
These two kinds of amendments - plus measures to forbid unfunded federal mandates - have delayed or derailed nearly every piece of environmental legislation and have frightened supporters away from even bringing up others, including a rewrite of the Endangered Species Act.
Even with a compromise plan developed by a broad environmental-industry coalition to work from, the urgently needed revision of the Superfund law has barely begun. With little time remaining in the session, a new law is a long shot.
What explains this bleak performance?
Many environmentalists blame the administration. But while the environment is clearly not among the issues on which the president is willing to spend his political capital, the administration has built a pretty solid record where progress is possible at low political cost.
The once-controversial climate treaty was ratified so smoothly that few realize it happened. Deft handling turned industry opposition to the biodiversity treaty into support. The United States helped reform the World Bank's Global Environmental Facility so that it can contribute to it. The administration also has moved to address the crisis caused by drastic overfishing, strengthened the North American Free Trade Agreement's environmental provisions and is turning a roads-only transportation policy into one that recognizes the environmental, energy and congestion-reducing benefits of other modes of travel. Most important, its practice generally reflects its rhetoric that environmental/economic conflicts often can be resolved to mutual benefit when there is the will to do so.
Political costs are more often high, however, because, more than on any other issue, Congress seems to shift automatically in opposition to an administration's environmental views. After his landslide victory, President-elect Reagan promised that a quick undoing of the Clean Air Act would set the tone for what was to follow. Instead, Congress dug in its heels. When it finally finished, 10 years later, it had substantially strengthened the law. This time, the shift is anti-environmental, and it is marked.
At the grass-roots, there is a modest backlash. Anti-environmentalists have learned from their opponents' successes. On some issues, progress has been slow because environmentalists feel that with friends in the White House the times do not demand compromise.
It may be too that we are in a transition period between the regulatory era and one in which economic signals will play a much greater role. Many of the easier tasks have been handled. Those that remain may require steps like removing subsidies, reflecting environmental costs in prices and using taxes to discourage environmental bads instead of economic goods like income and profits. Neither environmentalists nor the administration are ready to provide the leadership this new direction will demand.

Abstract: Vice President Al Gore, marking the 24th anniversary of Earth Day, Thursday called the threat of global warming "the most serious problem our civilization faces" and likened skeptics to leaders of the embattled tobacco industry. Like tobacco industry executives who have said there is no conclusive evidence that smoking can cause lung cancer, he said that many U.S. industrialists are warning that science has not proved that the accumulation of carbon gases will lead to the feared "global warming" effects. With many such industrialists in his audience, Gore scoffed that "there was a time earlier in (the tobacco) debate when some people actually believed" the tobacco industry's denials.

Full text: Vice President Al Gore, marking the 24th anniversary of Earth Day, Thursday called the threat of global warming "the most serious problem our civilization faces" and likened skeptics to leaders of the embattled tobacco industry.
"On one side there's a vast preponderance of serious scientists who have studied the evidence, and on the other hand we have a tiny minority of the self-interested who say, `We just don't know,' " Gore said.
Gore's comments were aimed at a vocal community of those who challenge scientists' assertions that the buildup of carbon gases in the atmosphere will lead to a warming of Earth's surface, with dramatic disruptions in weather conditions, agricultural production and sea levels.
Like tobacco industry executives who have said there is no conclusive evidence that smoking can cause lung cancer, he said that many U.S. industrialists are warning that science has not proved that the accumulation of carbon gases will lead to the feared "global warming" effects. With many such industrialists in his audience, Gore scoffed that "there was a time earlier in (the tobacco) debate when some people actually believed" the tobacco industry's denials.
The vice president's speech underscored the White House's challenge as it seeks to carry out President Clinton's promise to reduce the nation's emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition to skeptics resistant to making those reductions, the pace and urgency of the Administration's proposed solutions are frustrating environmentalists.
While Gore slammed the skeptics Thursday, the President gently chided environmentalists, telling an Earth Day gathering in the capital that "government should encourage people to work together, not pit business and workers and environmentalists against each other."
The Administration's comments came a day after the Energy Department signed an accord with more than 600 members of the Electric Utility Industry to reduce greenhouse gases. Under the memorandum of understanding, utilities voluntarily would adopt a variety of measures designed to reduce their release of carbon gases.
Environmentalists have attacked the agreement-and the Administration's efforts to draw industries into "partnerships" with government to achieve its environmental goals.
The Sierra Club, for instance, charged Thursday that the Administration's proposal for reducing greenhouse gases-announced last fall-will fail to stabilize those emissions at the 1990 level, as Clinton promised. The United States would have to cut 139 million metric tons of carbon emissions to meet its goals, but the plan Clinton has laid out will reduce those emissions by only about half of that, a Sierra Club analysis warned.
"This plan bows to polluters but merely doffs its hat to the global warming problem," Sierra Club analyst Daniel Becker said. "It's good for polluter public relations but doesn't do much for the planet."
In response to such charges, Gore held out an olive branch to environmental groups, declaring that they are playing a crucial role in holding the Administration to its promises.
"We need you; we need you," Gore said. "Keep it up."
On Thursday, Gore cited not only scientists, but also a study from the Travelers Corp. insurance company that said even a modest 0.9-degree Fahrenheit increase in average global temperature by 2010 could extend the hurricane season by 20 days, cause a 33% jump in hurricane landfalls in the United States, increase storms' severity and cause a 30% annual rise in catastrophic U.S. losses from storms.

Full text: I don't usually use this space for birth notices, but how could I resist?
Over at the Stanley Park Children's Zoo and Rare Breeds Conservancy, two brand-new arrivals have arrived already this year - - ahead of the spring rush -- and I thought it would be nice to welcome them.
One is a rare Jacob sheep -- the other a not-so-rare, but utterly beautiful, Shetland-miniature pony mix whose mom looks like a cross between a tiny Clydesdale and the pony Cinderella ought to ride.
I know, their pictures have already been in the papers -- a birth at the Children's Zoo is always an occasion for supervisor Alan Regan to call up our photo department.
But when I went out myself, I was reminded of the wonderful ark- like feel of the place, all its good intentions and achievements, its preserving and conserving and nurturing functions -- and how sorry I was that the zoo referendum on last fall's civic ballot had been voted down.
Not that I'm in favor of zoos in any of their traditional forms; it's just that preserving and conserving and nurturing is the direction in which enlightened thinking is taking us while the old- fashioned cages quickly fade into memory.
The Children's Zoo was not directly affected -- it's still there. But Regan was disappointed too, partly because of the misleading wording of the referendum question, and also the way the vote was restricted to only Vancouver city proper -- not to the suburbs, "where all the families live."
Now, says Regan, the situation "is really uncertain. We're trying to figure out the whole role for this area. What are people going to say when they get on the (children's) train and there's nothing there?"
He says he sees a number of possibilities -- to have the Children's Zoo fulfilling a slightly different role, perhaps an expanded and more viable breeding function, perhaps using some older facilities for new purposes, perhaps having more focal interpretive and educational programs.
The Zoological Society's barn owl preservation program could move here, for instance. They have a nice barn that could be adapted.
Still, everything is theoretical: "We're just hoping that something positive comes out of it all."
One of the most positive things that is already in place, of course, is the rare breeds program, part of a global network trying to maintain genetic diversity in a world where genetic manipulation is creating fewer plant and animal breeds to maximize high food production and greater profits -- often losing valuable genetic material on the way.
"Rare breeds have quite a range of different abilities and advantageous traits," says Regan.
"(Preserving them) is like an insurance scheme for the future."
If some freak climate change, new pest, virus or bacteria were to affect plants or animals whose genetic makeup is the same, it would be far more likely to take out the whole group. Diversity means resilience, and a better chance for survival.
Meantime, even in winter, the Children's Zoo is open on weekends if the weather is good. In fact, pretty well all year round, except for during the school summer holiday months, weather determines its open days.
Call first -- 681-8729.

Study Bolsters Value Of Species Diversity

Abstract: The more species an ecosystem has, Dr. [David Tilman] explains, the more likely it is that some will be resistant to drought, disease, insect plague or any other stress that can threaten it. These resistant species spread and take the place of those harmed or killed by the stress. "This is a process that could apply to any ecosystem," he said, which makes it important to preserve biological diversity "because it's nature's insurance policy against catastrophes." The work of Dr. Tilman and Dr. [John A. Downing], reported in the current issue of the British journal Nature, "shows that a variety of species tends to buffer an ecosystem against extreme events," said Professor [John Lawton], "and that's a very important finding." On top of that, he said, his own work, carried out in a controlled laboratory setting, is also revealing that species diversity is important: even on an everyday basis, with no catastrophe looming, species-rich ecosystems tend to function more robustly than species-poor ones. The Tilman-Downing study is "quite sound," said Dr. Edward O. Wilson of Harvard University, an authority on biodiversity and an advocate for its conservation. Not least, he said, it helps point the way to understanding a "gray area" that has been "relatively intractable to experimentation or definitive field study and therefore not easily penetrated." The strategy followed by the two researchers was to combine the experimental approach of the laboratory with the real-world authenticity of a natural ecosystem.

Full text: CONSERVATIONISTS widely believe that the more species an ecosystem contains, the more robust and stable it will be. If that is true, they say, the steady reduction of biological diversity now taking place around the world could in time undermine the ecological foundation of human existence.
A counterargument holds that richness of species is unimportant to ecosystem stability as long as one or two species exist to carry out each of a number of vital functions like photosynthesis, pollination, plant-eating, predation and decomposition of waste. If that is true, the case for preserving biological diversity, the touchstone of conservation in the 1990's, loses one of its major props.
For a long time there was little or no scientific evidence on the question. But now scientists have produced some, and it supports the view that biological diversity is indeed important to the functioning and stability of ecosystems.
Dr. David Tilman of the University of Minnesota in St. Paul and Dr. John A. Downing of the University of Montreal studied the behavior of prairie ecosystems for seven years. They found that the grassland plots with the greatest diversity of plant species lost far less of their vegetative cover as a result of the worst drought in 50 years, and recovered much more quickly, than the plots with the fewest species. The loss of each additional species resulted in a sharper reduction of the ecosystem's resistance to drought, the study suggests.
The more species an ecosystem has, Dr. Tilman explains, the more likely it is that some will be resistant to drought, disease, insect plague or any other stress that can threaten it. These resistant species spread and take the place of those harmed or killed by the stress. "This is a process that could apply to any ecosystem," he said, which makes it important to preserve biological diversity "because it's nature's insurance policy against catastrophes."
The evidence runs directly counter to the rival hypothesis, advanced by Prof. John Lawton, a British ecologist, not out of personal conviction but as a devil's-advocate scientific test. As a result of the Tilman-Downing findings and his own experimental work, Professor Lawton appears to be gravitating to the view of those who say species diversity matters. 'A Very Important Finding'
The work of Dr. Tilman and Dr. Downing, reported in the current issue of the British journal Nature, "shows that a variety of species tends to buffer an ecosystem against extreme events," said Professor Lawton, "and that's a very important finding." On top of that, he said, his own work, carried out in a controlled laboratory setting, is also revealing that species diversity is important: even on an everyday basis, with no catastrophe looming, species-rich ecosystems tend to function more robustly than species-poor ones.
The emerging evidence is bringing a measure of clarity to a subject largely characterized until now by hazy speculation. Many scientists are convinced that if whole classes of vital organisms -- invertebrates, for example -- were somehow eliminated, the global ecosystem would collapse and most other species would disappear, humans included.
Many researchers have believed that species losses short of this extreme case could undercut ecosystem functioning, and that if enough ecosystems are affected the functioning of the biosphere at large -- humanity's life-support system -- could be seriously impaired. It is not necessary for species to go extinct globally for an ecosystem to crash, they fear, but only for enough species to disappear within that ecosystem. And while these scientists have been convinced that an ecosystem will collapse if certain keystone species disappear, they have had no clear idea of when an ecosystem begins to disintegrate.
What they do know is that humans are rapidly eliminating habitats and introducing exotic species that choke out native ones, both of which reduce the diversity of ecosystems.
The Tilman-Downing findings emerged from a long-term study of the factors affecting species composition, dynamics and diversity in Minnesota grasslands that began in 1982. The drought of 1987-88, the fourth worst since records have been kept in Minnesota, provided a fortuitous test of resistance to and recovery from stress among native plant species growing on the study's 207 plots.
For each plot, the researchers calculated the rate of change in biomass, or dry weight of plant material above the ground. They found that during the drought, the plots with the most species produced about half their predrought biomass, while those with the fewest species produced only about one-eighth. By 1992 the species-rich plots had recovered their predrought biomass, while those poorest in species still produced significantly less than before. Help for Ecological Restoration
The researchers found that species-rich plots were more likely to contain some drought-resistant species. These plants stepped up their growth to compensate partly for the decreased growth of other species.
"We're greatly surprised by the clarity of the response we saw," said Dr. Tilman. "We expected there to be a relationship between biodiversity and stability, but we did not expect the relationship to be as strong or as clear as it turned out to be."
The findings could have special meaning for the emerging art and practice of ecological restoration. Reviving only a handful of species may not be sufficient to restore an ecosystem's essential functions. "It doesn't say how many you need, but it does say you better put some variety in there if you're going to cope with the normal run of extremes or perturbations," said Dr. Peter Vitousek, an ecologist at Stanford University.
Is there a threshold above which an increasing number of species no longer makes much difference to ecosystem stability?
Dr. Tilman and Dr. Downing found that once there were 9 or 10 plant species, there was no longer a significant effect on ecosystem functioning. But since the researchers did not have many more than 10 species in their samplings, they do not know whether this constitutes a threshold. That question, which may have different answers for different ecosystems, is still to be investigated.
While there is at present "no better data set than ours" addressing the the relationship of biodiversity to ecosystem stability, Dr. Tilman said, he and Dr. Downing are undertaking more rigorous studies aimed at producing a "very definitive answer" to the question. Support for Conservation
And although "we do not yet know how the stability of other ecosystems depends on biodiversity, these results lend further urgency to pleas for the conservation of biodiversity," the two ecologists wrote in Nature.
The Tilman-Downing study is "quite sound," said Dr. Edward O. Wilson of Harvard University, an authority on biodiversity and an advocate for its conservation. Not least, he said, it helps point the way to understanding a "gray area" that has been "relatively intractable to experimentation or definitive field study and therefore not easily penetrated." The strategy followed by the two researchers was to combine the experimental approach of the laboratory with the real-world authenticity of a natural ecosystem.
Professor Lawton said the study "carries an important message: that species matter in the ability of ecosystems to recover from extreme events."
These events, he said, might be naturally occurring or caused by humans, like the climate change that some scientists believe is occurring as a result of emissions of industrial gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. As human activity reduces the number and distribution of species, he said, "we begin to put large areas of the planet into a double whammy: global climate change and fewer species as well."
Professor Lawton runs experiments in ecosystem behavior at a controlled environmental facility at the British Natural Environment Research Council's Center for Population Biology at Imperial College in Silwood Park, England. "We've created a series of little communities with varying complexity, and can run them through a series of plant variations and speed time up."
Through this approach, he said, he and his colleagues have found that species matter in ecosystem functioning. For instance, he said, "we showed that the most species-rich ecosystems were the ones most able to absorb carbon dioxide" and that "a whole set of ecosystem processes changed as species changed." He said the findings are now being reviewed for publication.
Because many people were writing about the relationship of biodiversity to the functioning of ecosystems "without any evidence at all," Professor Lawton said, he proposed the alternative hypothesis that one or two species representing each important ecosystem function are sufficient. Speaking as a scientist, he said he has been "completely neutral about which way the answer comes out; that's how science proceeds, by testing alternative hypotheses."
But speaking personally, he said he was "delighted by these results" because they "strengthen the argument for conserving species and intact ecosystems."

Abstract: CONSERVATIONISTS widely believe that the more species an ecosystem contains, the more robust and stable it will be. If that is true, they say, the steady reduction of biological diversity now taking place around the world could in time undermine the ecological foundation of human existence.

Climate Change for Health Reform Polls show crime is top concern: [NASSAU AND SUFFOLK Edition]

Abstract: For starters, polls now show that the public's most gnawing worries have shifted away from health care to crime. Conservative Republicans have begun to promote feverishly the idea that there really is no health crisis anyway. And government statistics show national health spending declining - a blip on the trend scale, but a boon to those who argue the system can largely fix itself. Nevertheless, some members see ways to tinker privately. For instance, employer mandates could be softened to require much less than the 80-percent contribution from smaller businesses. Alliances could be eliminated, or scaled back. Premium caps could be eliminated for a year or so, and the phase-in for universal coverage could be extended by several years. Even if such hoops are jumped through - and that's a big "if," says Marilyn Moon of the Washington-based Urban Institute, since "for every problem you solve you create new ones" - it still may not be good enough for some. The reason? A growing bipartisan group of lawmakers simply believes Congress should shoot for a less ambitious bill - say, one that prohibits health-insurance companies from discriminating against the really sick, the elderly or people with preexisting medical conditions. "I would think the people of America would be grateful if we can pass reforms that solve three or four problems - not all of them," said Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), who, though a fervid supporter of universal coverage, thinks a broad-based tax is the more "honest" way to fund it.

Full text:   Washington - It has been four months since President Bill Clinton delivered to the nation an impassioned speech on his vision for a better national health-care system; months, too, since Hillary Rodham Clinton swept through Capitol Hill with her own sparkling pitch for what would become the administration's 1,342-page plan for change.
Theirs was, by every measure, autumn's Big Splash. And yet, owing to a crowded White House agenda and lately, the irksome distraction of the Whitewater case, only now is the actual, dogged swim about to get under way.
On Tuesday night, when the president delivers his first State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress, he is expected to refire the starting gun on health-care policy. But this time he will do it in a political environment that's decidedly different - far more complicated, perhaps less genteel - than it was even a few months ago.
If the going was predicted to be choppy then, observers say it is sure to be outright treacherous now.
"It's just that a lot of events have interceded since September, and so what you've been hearing is a kind of slow hissing sound as the gas has been escaping from the health-care balloon," said Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. "Things have changed."
For starters, polls now show that the public's most gnawing worries have shifted away from health care to crime. Conservative Republicans have begun to promote feverishly the idea that there really is no health crisis anyway. And government statistics show national health spending declining - a blip on the trend scale, but a boon to those who argue the system can largely fix itself.
Meanwhile, whatever luster the Clinton plan once had has been wiped clean by a determined army of interest-group opponents with big lobbying and advertising war chests. In addition, many members of Congress are declaring so much wrong with the White House proposal these days that major surgery appears inevitable.
And just this weekend, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas urged Republican leaders meeting in Washington to unite on their approach against Clinton and his health-care reform.
Even Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), who introduced the Clinton bill in the Senate, appears hard-pressed to embrace any of its features, choosing instead to peck away critically at its financing, its Medicaid formulas, its complexity, even its raison d'etre - that the current system is a mess.
Whether any of this signals disaster for the Clintons' "bottom-line" goal of passing legislation this year, comprehensive health benefits for all Americans is impossible for anybody to guarantee so soon - and most Democrats dare not. "It's within our reach," said Sen. Harris Wofford (D-Pa.) whose own election two years ago set off a national recognition of how angry Americans were about health care.
Indeed, key House committee leaders ambitiously have set an early spring deadline to complete hearings and a markup on the Clinton bill, which members will judge in comparison to several other strongly competing bills - including one by moderate Republicans, another by a bipartisan group that includes conservative Democrats and one by a sizable contingent of liberal Democrats which supports a Canadian-style system. The Senate's timetable appears to be slower-paced and may well jeopardize hopes for an early summer floor debate.
But even Wofford concedes that some masterful negotiations will have to take place for Clinton to salvage the integrity, if not the specifics, of his plan.
Just how that can happen, many analysts agree, is precisely the crux of the matter. The linchpins of the Clinton plan happen to be its most controversial parts: employer mandates, Clinton's primary scheme for making sure everybody is covered; health purchasing alliances, which would bargain with networks of doctors and hospitals for low prices, and government limits on the cost of insurance premiums, a backup if market competition doesn't work.
Nevertheless, some members see ways to tinker privately. For instance, employer mandates could be softened to require much less than the 80-percent contribution from smaller businesses. Alliances could be eliminated, or scaled back. Premium caps could be eliminated for a year or so, and the phase-in for universal coverage could be extended by several years.
But even if such hoops are jumped through - and that's a big "if," says Marilyn Moon of the Washington-based Urban Institute, since "for every problem you solve you create new ones" - it still may not be good enough for some. The reason? A growing bipartisan group of lawmakers simply believes Congress should shoot for a less ambitious bill - say, one that prohibits health-insurance companies from discriminating against the really sick, the elderly or people with preexisting medical conditions. "I would think the people of America would be grateful if we can pass reforms that solve three or four problems - not all of them," said Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), who, though a fervid supporter of universal coverage, thinks a broad-based tax is the more "honest" way to fund it.
For its part, the White House wants nothing to do with talk of bargains and deals. "This compromise stuff just gets under my skin," said White House spokesman Jeff Eller. "We've said all along there'd be changes in the bill." It is universal coverage with broad benefits, he said, that cannot be sacrificed. And he argues that the White House should just be allowed to make its case, its way, in time.
Only in the last week or so has the administration been able to begin doing that in earnest, however. Its new health-care campaign manager, New York lawyer Harold Ickes, has just begun plotting a full-blown strategy for wooing Congress and the public. Amid a major reorganization of staff who will be enlisted for the effort, public forums are being planned, as are numerous appearances by the administration officials and the first lady and lots of behind-the-scenes meetings with key players.
Meanwhile, an outside group backing the Clinton plan - of which organized labor is a part - this week launches a mutimillion-dollar media campaign to respond in part to the one being run by the insurance and pharmaceutical industries.
Still, analysts say, it will be the president who potentially will have the greatest sway with the public and with Congress.
"It's a long-odds proposition," said Aaron of Brookings. "But if the stars alight themselves appropriately - which means he has the beneficiary of good luck and not be a perpetrator of missteps like in the first year - then this thing could fly."

The Case Of the Met's Empty Galleries

Abstract: In his statement, Mr. de Montebello cited the Spanish elections: "A lengthy period of governmental transition occurred during which the crucial approval process for loans came to a virtual halt. The time lost simply could not be recouped." He thanked officials at the Culture Ministry for their "heroic efforts" but said it was "inappropriate" to rush the shipment to New York. "Our primary concern and responsibility is the safety of works of art." For Ms. Tarapor, however, the paperwork demanded by the Culture Ministry came as a complete surprise. "Since 1987, we have never been asked to provide anything beyond a list with the insurance evaluation of the lenders," she said. "If the rules changed somewhere along the way, the ministry had a responsibility to inform us." Mr. [Jesus Macarron] said he too was puzzled by the requirement. "I've never before had to give loan forms to the junta," he said. And in Mr. de Montebello's view, this time the Met faced "an extremely conservative junta, many of whose members were not well disposed to loans." Despite all the misunderstandings surrounding this affair, both the Met and Spain's Culture Ministry seem eager to resume good relations. Noting that the two sides have a long record of close collaboration, Mr. [Jose Guirao] said Spain is "always interested in participating in any exhibition at an institution like the Met." And in a letter to Mrs. [Carmen Alborch Bataller] thanking her for her help, Mr. de Montebello said that 1995, when the Met celebrates its 125th anniversary, would be a "propitious occasion" to hold the medieval art exhibition "on a scale that the subject and the works deserve."

Full text: IT WAS AT A PRIVATE LUNCHeon in New York on Oct. 8, 1991, that Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, first asked a senior official from Spain's Culture Ministry to support a major exhibition on the art of medieval Spain. Delighted by the Spaniard's enthusiastic response, Mr. de Montebello gave his team the go-ahead for what promised to be one of the museum's showpiece exhibitions of the 1990's.
The Met and Spain already had an impeccable record of working together, starting in 1987, on major exhibitions of such figures as Zurbaran, Goya, Velazquez and Ribera, as well as of the Islamic art of Spain. In the two years that followed the meeting with Jose Maria Luzon Nogue, then Spain's Director General of Fine Arts, Met officials combed Spain for the 80 or so works -- from Visigothic marble tombs to Romanesque wooden carvings -- they would need from that country. In all, the show was to include some 160 works.
"It was to be the most ambitious Spanish exhibition to date," said Mahrukh Tarapor, the Met's associate director for exhibitions, who played a crucial role in organizing earlier Spanish shows. "It was to be the Met's tribute to Spain, examining the most critical and formative period of Spanish history."
Then, barely two weeks before the official opening on Nov. 15, "The Art of Medieval Spain, A.D. 500-1200" was abruptly called off. Many in the art world were stunned. Exhibitions are sometimes delayed, even canceled, but the Met had never before postponed a major show this late in the day -- with catalogues already in print and invitations in the mail.
The museum felt it had no choice. At that moment, the pieces that had been chosen and approved for loan to the Met were still scattered around Spain. Since it was unclear when they would arrive in New York, Mr. de Montebello said in a press release on Oct. 29 that the museum's own calender of events "precluded our accommodating even a brief delay in 'Medieval Spain.' " But he said he hoped the show could still be held "sometime in 1995."
So what happened? Why did time run out? The story tells much about the complexity of mounting ambitious international loan exhibitions and how and why minor details can derail them -- although rarely so dramatically as in this case. Yet while there is some finger-pointing
between Spain and the Met, there seems to be no single explanation for why these longtime associates failed to come together on so important an occasion.
Clearly, this was a complicated exhibition to organize, with about half the pieces coming from Spain and the rest from elsewhere in Europe and the United States. In Spain, it involved borrowing from independent institutions all over the country. Spanish elections in late June brought Cabinet changes that delayed the approval of loans. And poor communications between Spain and the Met seem to have plagued the negotiations.
The final bottleneck was bureaucratic. Before approving the temporary export of the works, the Culture Ministry's rules required a mountain of documents. The Met says it was unaware of this requirement until late September. And by the time the documents were rounded up in a last-minute scramble in which ministry officials lent a hand, the art should already have been in New York and ready for installation.
Yet if any culprit can be identified, it is perhaps the cultural gap that still separates Americans and Spaniards. For the Met, the show could only heighten Spain's image in the United States -- and it took Spanish cooperation for granted. But in Spain, politics, religious sentiments and regional pride all emerged as complicating factors when it came to deciding what should be lent. An Ominous Sign Provincials Say Madrid Has Doubts
The problems surrounding this show had not arisen in the Met's previous dealings with Spain because the shows of Spanish masters like Goya had involved borrowing paintings from the Prado and a few other Government-run museums. In the case of last year's Islamic art show, the Spanish Government was a participant and a Spanish bank the main sponsor. But with "The Art of Medieval Spain," the Met was the sole organizer. Even more important, the priceless objects it wished to display were the property of dozens of churches, cathedrals, Catholic schools and regional museums, each with a right of veto.
Aware of this, Ms. Tarapor, along with Charles T. Little, curator of the exhibition, and other experts made numerous trips to Spain, going from institution to institution, inspecting objects and persuading their owners that nothing untoward would happen to them. Most owners agreed to lend their pieces, which ranged from wooden and stone statues, parts of altars and ancient Bibles to paintings, textiles, and marble and ivory sculptures. But Ms. Tarapor said some owners told her that the central Government in Spain was not enthusiastic about the exhibition. In Spain, that was an ominous sign.
The view from Madrid, on the other hand, was that public opposition to lending certain pieces of great religious significance was growing in some regions. In a June 28 letter to Mr. de Montebello, Mr. Luzon reminded him that each loan had to be approved by the owner, technical experts and the Culture Ministry's 22-member Junta of Qualification, Evaluation and Exportation. He also warned of "growing sensitivity expressed in different media in the sense that some works of art should not be moved from the places where they are habitually kept."
By then, the loan of 12 medieval objects had already been denied -- 6 by the cultural authorities of Catalonia, who argued that the "exceptional" paintings on wood could be damaged by "possible vibrations and climate change," 3 by the Museum of the Cathedral of Gerona and 3 by the Archeological Museum of Oviedo. Gerona and Oviedo gave no reason for their refusals.
The Met was even more disappointed when the Culture Ministry refused to approve the loan of two other pieces the museum had avidly sought. In the case of the 12th-century marble Sarcophagus of Dona Sancha, the ministry appeared to respond to local opposition, although its owner, the Benedictine Monastery of Santa Cruz at Jaca in the Pyrenees, had approved the loan. In the case of the Reliquary of San Isidoro from Leon, an 11th-century silver gilt box, the loan of which had been approved by the Bishop of Leon, the ministry's evaluation committee judged it too fragile to travel. The Final Blow One Requirement Too Many
Nonetheless, plans for the exhibition were moving ahead. On July 30, Herbert Moskowitz, the registrar of the Met, informed Jesus Macarron that his Madrid shipping company had been chosen to pack and transport the pieces to New York and promised to send "an updated list of loans" within two weeks. It finally arrived on Sept. 3. On Sept. 23, Mr. Macarron presented the evaluation committee with a final list of 82 pieces for temporary export, confident that approval would be a formality.
The Met, too, was beginning to relax. In mid-September, Ms. Tarapor met the new Culture Minister, Carmen Alborch Bataller, who agreed to write a brief introduction to the 358-page catalogue, which by then was ready to go to the printers.
"From the start, we planned the catalogue as a definitive book on Spanish medieval art," she said, "so we included many works that we knew we might not get. But we also avoided listing lenders to the exhibition because we didn't know what we'd have. In fact, Philippe de Montebello only wrote his foreword after we received Mrs. Alborch's text at the end of September. At that point, we were confident that our deadline would be met." (The catalogue, published by Abrams, is now for sale at the museum.)
But it was around this time that things began to go badly wrong. When the evaluation committee met on Sept. 24, it approved the loan of 38 pieces belonging to the central Government but said it could not act on the remaining objects without letters from their 19 different owners confirming the loans, plus technical reports from experts certifying that the pieces could travel. Both Mr. Macarron and Culture Ministry officials then began contacting owners, but Ms. Tarapor said she only learned of the delay on Oct. 14. By then time was running out.
The committee met again on Oct. 22 and approved all but seven pieces sought by the Met. Three days earlier, Mr. Luzon had been replaced as Director General of Fine Arts by Jose Guirao, an Andalusian art expert. With Mr. de Montebello in contact with the Culture Minister, Ms. Tarapor urged Mr. Guirao to reconsider some of the denials. The ministry stood firm in refusing the Sarcophagus of Dona Sancha and the Reliquary of San Isidoro, but five more pieces were approved, including the Urraca Chalice from Leon that decorates the back of the catalogue. On Oct. 28, Mr. de Montebello and Mr. Guirao agreed on a final list of 80 objects.
At that point, the pieces were still languishing all over Spain. Mr. Macarron had hoped to start packing on Oct. 25 but wasn't given the green light by the Met until Oct. 28. The next day he was told that every crate had to be brought to Madrid, unpacked, inspected by a curator from the National Archeological Museum and repacked before being shipped. On top of that, he said, the assigned curator was taking an extended weekend break and would not be available until Nov. 3.
"With that additional requirement, which no one had known anything about, he told us he could not make the deadline," Ms. Tarapor said. That same day, Oct. 29, Mr. de Montebello called off the exhibition. The Explanations Nobody Nudging Things Along
In his statement, Mr. de Montebello cited the Spanish elections: "A lengthy period of governmental transition occurred during which the crucial approval process for loans came to a virtual halt. The time lost simply could not be recouped." He thanked officials at the Culture Ministry for their "heroic efforts" but said it was "inappropriate" to rush the shipment to New York. "Our primary concern and responsibility is the safety of works of art."
It is true that Mrs. Alborch had taken over only at the end of July -- and that Spain traditionally closes down during the vacation month of August. But others, like Mr. Luzon, say the real problem was the Met's failure to present papers to the evaluations committee.
"It is unjust to blame the change of government or bureaucracy," he said. "They should have had someone in Spain handling all the paperwork for a very complex exhibition like this. That's what happened with the Islamic art exhibition. You can't replace permits from the owners with high-level representations in the ministry."
Mr. Luzon, who has returned to teaching archeology at a Madrid university, insisted that he had intervened personally to obtain the approval of some owners and had even appointed an official to handle the paperwork. Clearly bitter over suggestions that his office had not fully backed the exhibition, he said: "The Met may have had other difficulties, but it is not fair that they should seek a scapegoat. They've had to postpone an exhibition, and they're trying to save face."
His replacement, Mr. Guirao, agreed that the Met should have appointed a representative in Spain to nudge things along. "Administration in Spain is very complicated," he said, "and everything takes time. In this case, the pieces needed the approval of the owners, the regional governments and the junta. If the borrower only presents a list, the ministry has to do the querying."
For Ms. Tarapor, however, the paperwork demanded by the Culture Ministry came as a complete surprise. "Since 1987, we have never been asked to provide anything beyond a list with the insurance evaluation of the lenders," she said. "If the rules changed somewhere along the way, the ministry had a responsibility to inform us." Mr. Macarron said he too was puzzled by the requirement. "I've never before had to give loan forms to the junta," he said. And in Mr. de Montebello's view, this time the Met faced "an extremely conservative junta, many of whose members were not well disposed to loans."
Before postponing the exhibition, Mr. de Montebello met with a dozen aides to discuss whether the opening could be delayed. But it could not, Ms. Tarapor said, because the museum's calendar was packed for November and December, including openings of "The Gold of Meroe" on Nov. 23, the Florence Gould galleries on Dec. 1, "Diana Vreeland: Immoderate Style" on Dec. 9 and a Lucian Freud retrospective on Dec. 16. And the galleries where the Spanish medieval show was to be held were needed in early May for an exhibition of American Impressionism. The Future Morale Is Down, But Wait Till 1995
The postponement was clearly a blow to morale at the Met. "We're all feeling so badly burned," Ms. Tarapor said. "We have a shellshocked institution but one that has acted with honesty throughout." The museum had not yet calculated the cost of the postponement, she said, but she estimated the show's original budget at around $1 million. Still, at least there was no need to cancel expensive catering arrangements because, with no outside sponsor to pay for a gala dinner, the Met had planned a low-key opening. Further, since installation had not begun in the now empty galleries, only Mr. Macarron's company has still to be paid.
Was the Met a victim, Mr. de Montebello was asked. "We are, no question, but so is Spain and Spanish art, which is not being represented in the premier museum of the Western Hemisphere," he replied. In Spain, in contrast, the postponement of the exhibition came as a surprise. "Perhaps it was not well organized from the first moment," a Culture Ministry spokeswoman said, adding "The ministry acted impeccably."
Despite all the misunderstandings surrounding this affair, both the Met and Spain's Culture Ministry seem eager to resume good relations. Noting that the two sides have a long record of close collaboration, Mr. Guirao said Spain is "always interested in participating in any exhibition at an institution like the Met." And in a letter to Mrs. Alborch thanking her for her help, Mr. de Montebello said that 1995, when the Met celebrates its 125th anniversary, would be a "propitious occasion" to hold the medieval art exhibition "on a scale that the subject and the works deserve."
Ms. Tarapor was also ready to look forward. "It will be the most glorious show of Spanish art ever," she said. "And, if Spain wants it to be, it will be."

Full text: Edward Flattau, Washington, writes on environmental issues.
Those who are skeptical of any danger from future global warning argue that as long as major scientific uncertainty shrouds this phenomenon, it's foolhardy to launch costly initiatives attempting to retard climate change.
Their conviction that we need further information before we can justify taking steps to reduce humanity-generated greenhouse gas emissions is distinctly a minority view in the scientific community.
The consensus is that on the basis of what is already known, it would be prudent to take some precautionary actions. Given the immense scope of the worst potential scenario, there's more risk in standing pat than in investing in mitigating strategies that turn out to be unnecessary.
Even if you agree with the skeptics, however, their do-nothing approach (in deference to checkbook concerns) doesn't make much sense in the face of greenhouse emission abatement measures that would be beneficial for society (and the economy), even if there were no global warming.
These readily available strategies primarily consist of vastly improving the efficiency of energy use in every sector of society, and of launching massive reforestation efforts.
Yet, even if we were to implement these approaches to perfection and reduce greenhouse emissions sufficiently to slow global warming and eventually stabilize it, there will be at least a century when temperatures around the Earth will increase several degrees because of past discharged pollutants concentrated in the atmosphere. Thus, the risk of a potentially disruptive period extends far into the future, no matter how successful our preventive maneuvers.
With that in mind, the Office of Technology Assessment, Congress' research arm, has just completed a study that reviews relatively painless ways for humanity to mitigate any disagreeable effects from accelerated climate change.
The technology office calls these strategies "no regrets" or "low regrets" options because they too would benefit society in their own right, separate from any moderating effect they might have on global warming's consequences. It turns out that these options are pretty much one and the same with the reforms that the national environmental movement has long been seeking.
The technology office arrived at its conclusions by deducing that the healthier and more diverse an ecosystem was, the more resistant it would be to any stresses brought about by climate change.
Because of the possibility that the sea level could rise due to global warming, the technology office urged that the government enact regulations to discourage further development in hazardous, flood-prone areas. Financial disincentives would include higher flood-insurance premiums or no insurance at all for would-be occupants of hazardous zones. Erosion setback requirements for houses on or near vulnerable beachfront acreage would be another reform.
Even if significant greenhouse-induced sea-level rise doesn't materialize, the threats to life, limb and property from severe storms would be diminished by these steps.
The technology office recommended that fiscal incentives be introduced to encourage more efficient use and conservation of water, given the possibility that rainfall patterns could shift and areas previously strangers to drought would no longer enjoy that good fortune.
As far as agriculture is concerned, the technology office suggested that efforts be intensified to develop drought-resistant variations of staple crops, and that government subsidies guide farmers toward diversification and flexibility in their operations.
The science of restoring and creating wetlands must be perfected, since we now know their enormous value as well as the potentially serious menace to their survival (depending upon location) from accelerated climate change.
The technology office proposed that federal land acquisition programs focus wherever possible on purchasing corridors for publically owned natural areas so that flora and fauna adversely affected by climate change might be able to migrate to more favorable haunts.
Again, it's important to remember that these technology office recommendations would do us a world of good regardless of any ameliorating effect they might have on unpleasant global warming impacts.
So while the prospect of climate change may be unsettling, it could still work to our advantage if it drives home the lesson that the better we take care of Earth, the better Earth will take care of us.

A PRUDENT PLAN ON GLOBAL WARMING: [NORTH SPORTS FINAL EDITION]

Abstract: President Clinton's long-anticipated climate change action plan, aimed at reducing the dispersal of so-called greenhouse gases, is reminiscent of the traditional wisdom about chicken soup: It won't hurt you, and it very well may be good for you. It is not, however, making everyone feel better. Environmental groups generally are disappointed, because with a few exceptions the plan does not contain a call for restrictions and regulations that would better ensure its success. But in opting for a largely voluntary approach with government-industry partnerships, the administration chose wisely. Though there is concern that the buildup of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, could lead to calamitous overheating of the planet, there is by no means scientific consensus about the threat-or even the fact that global warming is underway. In the absence of certainty, Clinton-like George Bush before him-is leery of committing the nation to a series of unnecessary command-and-control measures that could inflict enormous, recessionary costs on business.

Full text:   President Clinton's long-anticipated climate change action plan, aimed at reducing the dispersal of so-called greenhouse gases, is reminiscent of the traditional wisdom about chicken soup: It won't hurt you, and it very well may be good for you.
It is not, however, making everyone feel better. Environmental groups generally are disappointed, because with a few exceptions the plan does not contain a call for restrictions and regulations that would better ensure its success. But in opting for a largely voluntary approach with government-industry partnerships, the administration chose wisely.
Though there is concern that the buildup of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, could lead to calamitous overheating of the planet, there is by no means scientific consensus about the threat-or even the fact that global warming is underway. In the absence of certainty, Clinton-like George Bush before him-is leery of committing the nation to a series of unnecessary command-and-control measures that could inflict enormous, recessionary costs on business.
The Clinton approach does differ markedly from the Bush philosophy in one respect: It formally commits the United States to specific goals and timetables, reducing emissions of culprit gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000. In that, it also goes a step beyond the Bush-engineered climate agreement at last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
Under any strategy, the principle is that we're better off with fewer of these gases in the atmosphere.
The emphasis in the 50-point Clinton plan will be on using American technological ingenuity to increase energy efficiency, thus decreasing dependence on gas-creating fossil fuels. The government will encourage better heating and cooling of buildings, more energy-efficient lighting and-through new standards-more efficient household appliances.
Partnerships also will permit private investment in federal hydroelectric dams and promote more use of natural gas and renewable energy sources. There will be regulations to reduce methane emissions from landfills, and the Agriculture Department will assist more tree planting and conservation, recognizing that trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.
In sum, these seemingly small steps-even such measures as promoting better inflation of tires-can have a cumulatively significant effect.
The plan also is notable for what it does not include: an energy tax once favored by the administration, higher fuel efficiency standards for cars and a scheme to include auto insurance premiums in the pump price of gasoline-all steps advocated by various environmental groups.
Industry groups, relieved that they will not be facing costly mandates, are supportive of the plan. And their general enthusiasm is an indicator that they will participate eagerly in the partnerships, extending the progress they already have made.
The risk is that the plan won't be tough enough to make a difference and the worst predictions about global warming will turn out to be true. But the administration has a stick amid the carrots-a vow to regularly review progress with a threat of future mandates. For now, however, the course is prudent and may be the only remedy necessary.

Abstract: Their findings are not heartening. Lloyd's of London -- which suffered $4.33 billion in losses in 1990 -- discovered that from 1966 to 1987, no natural disasters topped $1 billion in insurance losses. But in the next five years alone, 10 catastrophic windstorms cost more than $15 billion in insured losses. Swiss Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, acknowledged that the increase could be "an initial consequence of climatic change."

Full text: To the Editor:
Your Aug. 18 report on preparedness for the hurricane season on the East and Gulf Coasts in the aftermath of 1992's Hurricane Andrew and your Aug. 19 article on building a house to withstand a hurricane both neglect climate. Scientists and insurance companies alike are concerned that the increased intensity, frequency and cost of storms may be related to the climate changes caused by global warming.
As concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases derived primarily from the burning of fossil fuels increase in the atmosphere, Earth's climate could change dramatically. As insured losses from hurricanes and cyclones mount, several international companies have established in-house groups to study climate change.
Their findings are not heartening. Lloyd's of London -- which suffered $4.33 billion in losses in 1990 -- discovered that from 1966 to 1987, no natural disasters topped $1 billion in insurance losses. But in the next five years alone, 10 catastrophic windstorms cost more than $15 billion in insured losses. Swiss Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, acknowledged that the increase could be "an initial consequence of climatic change."
While millions of dollars are spent to improve flood walls and levees, little is being done to employ the safe energy that would reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. No doubt, better building codes and enforcement are necessary, but the great Midwest flood reminds us that the best engineering can be breached by rampaging weather. Real disaster prevention requires kicking our fossil fuel habit. KELLY QUIRKE Washington, Aug. 20, 1993 The writer is with Greenpeace's climate change campaign.

Abstract: It virtually stopped Tuesday. Fisheries Minister Ross Reid said stocks had hit record lows, and announced the closure of most of what remained of the fishery. About 12,000 people will lose their jobs; scores of communities in Quebec and the Atlantic Provinces will lose their raison d'tre.

Full text:   Almost 500 years ago, explorer John Cabot declared the seas off Newfoundland were "swarming with fish, which can be taken . . . in baskets let down with a stone," and the East Coast cod fishery began in earnest.
It virtually stopped Tuesday. Fisheries Minister Ross Reid said stocks had hit record lows, and announced the closure of most of what remained of the fishery. About 12,000 people will lose their jobs; scores of communities in Quebec and the Atlantic Provinces will lose their raison d'tre.
The job losses are in addition to the 30,000 people left unemployed by last year's ban on cod fishing off eastern Newfoundland and quota cuts imposed to save fish stocks devastated by overfishing and climate change.
"Whatever we do, we have to be realistic," Reid told a news conference in Halifax. "We can't deal with wishes and hopes and dreams."
If there was any comfort for those in the industry, it lay in the fact that the news was expected.
Peter Hennebury, a 46-year-old cod fisherman in Lord's Cove, Nfld., exclaimed "Gee whiz, no!" when asked if he was surprised by the move, noting there are few fish left to catch.
"It was a wise decision. We've had failures in our fishery since 1989."
Hennebury noted he was glad to have scraped up the 10 weeks' work required to qualify for unemployment insurance.
Reid announced a $190-million short-term compensation package, but admitted he didn't know how long it would be before things get better. He insisted, though, there will be a fishery of some sort in the future.
"It doesn't mean abandoning all our rural communities; it doesn't mean abandoning our very unique and important way of life. But it means recognizing that all of us can't be there forever."
In a community such as Lockeport, N.S., on a peninsula jutting into the Atlantic south of Halifax, the only real reasons to "be there" are to fish, or to work at a fish processing plant.
"Fishermen are going bankrupt, that's the pure and simple fact of the matter. We have the choice now as to what we do in the next year or two as to how many go bankrupt," said Lockeport fisherman Joe Richmond.
The impact of the closures will be felt in southwestern Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, Prince Edward Island, northeastern New Brunswick, Quebec and western and southern Newfoundland. It's impossible to say which communities will be affected until processing companies decide which plants to close and fishermen tie up their boats.
The valuable bottom-feeding species such as cod, flounder, haddock and pollock account for half the fish caught in the region and provided at least half the 140,000 jobs in the East Coast fishery.
Jim Barkhouse, Nova Scotia's fisheries minister, estimated that 3,000 fishing and processing jobs will be lost in his province and another 3,500 people in related industries such as ship repair and supply will also be without work.
Bernard Valcourt, federal human resources minister, said compensation and retraining funds will be extended to affected fishermen and plant workers.
But the aid package, which will redirect money from existing programs to avoid padding the federal deficit, only covers displaced workers until next May.
The compensation is an "ad hoc response to an emergency situation," said Valcourt, warning people to take advantage of training programs to get out of the fishery.
"Young Atlantic Canadians have got to come to face the reality of the future," he said.
But Earle McCurdy, president of the Fisheries, Food and Allied Workers' Union, said: "You can't just shut down the fishery and say 'here's an adult basic education course, good luck. . . . We're not going to convert New World Island into Silicon Valley."
Reid said the federal government will ask foreign countries to stop fishing just outside Canada's 200-nautical-mile jurisdiction. The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, which sets quotas outside the zone, will be asked to impose the ban at a meeting in Halifax next week.
East Coast fishermen have seven days to remove their nets from the newly affected areas, said Reid, who adopted the report of a blue-ribbon panel -- the Fisheries Resource Conservation Council -- that recommended the closure a week ago.
A year after the federal government closed Newfoundland's northern cod fishery, council members from industry, government and the scientific community reported the lowest numbers of groundfish ever observed in the Northwest Atlantic.
The council report said the spawning stock of mature fish -- those able to reproduce -- is also at an all-time low. Fish are growing slower, it said, and a high percentage are being killed by the fishery, predators such as seals and ocean conditions such as cold water.

Full text:   Prairies turn into wetlands Records set for rainfall
Friday, August 20, 1993
DAVID ROBERTS
Winnipeg MB -- BY DAVID ROBERTS Manitoba Bureau WINNIPEG The summer of '93 has turned out to be a rain-sodden writeoff on the Prairies.
Yesterday, Regina broke the record for summer saturation. The Queen City has seen the wettest June, July and August since people began to measure such things in the 1880s.
As of midnight yesterday, 344.4 millimetres of rain had fallen on Regina since June 1, smashing the 1909 record of 330.7 mm. And it hasn't exactly been hot. Regina's mean temperature in July was 15.7, compared with the normal 19.1.
Winnipeg obliterated its 1962 record for summer rainfall last week. As of Aug. 15, the Manitoba capital had absorbed 427.8 mm of rain since June 1. The normal rainfall for the period is 231 mm. It rained much of yesterday. And the day before. And the day before that.
Quite a contrast to the weather in Ontario. So far this month, about 30 mm of rain have fallen on Toronto, compared with the normal 40. And it has been warm - a mean temperature of 22, about normal for this time of the year.
Basements in the Winnipeg suburb of South Transcona have been under water for a month. As soon as homeowners bail out from one deluge, another comes along. After sewers overflowed, the residents took to canoes, scooping human excrement out of flooded alleyways and basements.
Almost daily, radio stations interview climatologists, meteorologists, psychologists, hydrologists and civil engineers about the uncommonly wet weather.
Everyone is talking about the rain. Psychologists have reported seeing a lot of depressed people in raincoats and rubber boots, many of them farmers.
"Things are looking pretty tough," said John Waterer, a crop specialist for the Manitoba Agriculture Department. "The crops are in tough shape," he said. "The basic problem is an absence of heat. That, plus the fact the crops are sitting in lakes of water."
For the second consecutive year, the outlook for the wheat harvest is less than optimistic. Oilseeds such as canola thrive in wet conditions, but lentils and vegetables have been all but wiped out.
There is no dearth of theories to explain all the rain after several years of drought; a volcano in the Philippines, the residue of the 1991 Kuwaiti oil fires, auto emissions and a Pacific atmospheric inversion, the so-called El Nino effect, are all being blamed.
On Wednesday, environmentalists in Ottawa called a news conference to suggest that the torrential prairie rains - and withered trees in Vancouver - are hints of catastrophic climate change caused in part by 463,133 kilotons of carbon dioxide spewed into the atmosphere over Canada last year.
But Tim Ball, a University of Winnipeg climatologist, said it is about time that prairie dwellers woke up to the fact that they live in a harsh and changeable part of the planet.
He said he is puzzled by those who express surprise at this summer's rains, because long-term records show that the area is due for a period of usettled weather.
"We're returning to a period of more variability of weather, much like we had prior to the 1940s," he said. "From '40 to '80, we had relatively consistent weather . . . and what people came to think of as normal during that period is anything but normal."
Whatever the cause of the rainfall - farmers say it just evaporates from the ground, creates clouds and falls again - insurance adjusters say the damage is in the millions of dollars.
Welfare recipients have been pressed into duty for flood cleanup.
The Red River is still bulging at its banks, although flooding is caused by runoff problems in the valley's clay-like soil and not by the kind of massive spring runoff that created the Great Winnipeg Flood of 1950.
Still, David Christianson, a Winnipeg financial adviser, has twice pumped nearly a metre of water and raw sewage from his basement his summer. "Four years ago, I was watering the foundation around the house because of the drought," he said.
Psychologists and local officials say people should not let the weather get them down, and they insist that the Prairies remain a great place to live.
"I'd say people are starting to come to terms with it," said Gene Kaprowy, a Winnipeg psychologist.
One day in Winnipeg last week, the rain suddenly stopped. Thousands of vexed and clammy homeowners cranked up their vacuum pumps and headed downstairs to slurp sludge from their basements.
As the sun peeked out and dirty clouds disappeared, scores of nervous people emerged to welcome back an old friend: the wide blue canopy of prairie sky. Jackets were put away, and shorts and bikinis came back out.
But fidgety people attract mosquitoes.
And the vast pools of water surrounding prairie communities are exquisite breeding grounds for 40 different species of mosquito. The sun comes out and the larvae hatch.
Regina caught a record number of them in bug traps a few weeks ago, just around the time Prime Minister Kim Campbell paid a visit. Ms. Campbell said that although she applied insect spray before a late-night jog in Saskatoon, she still got a few bites.
Entomologists were finding more than 4,000 mosquitoes a trap in some parts of Saskatchewan. The same thing happened in Winnipeg earlier this month as mosquito levels approached the July, 1991, numbers of 4,600 a trap. This coincided with a full moon - around Aug. 2 - at which time, experts say, mosquitoes become especially thirsty.
But the mosquitoes soon will disappear, pest experts say. They will be replaced by next week with an infestation of sow bugs and carpenter ants that have been secretly thriving in wet basements.

Abstract: CHEERFUL news for corn-cob lovers from the investigation into climate change by the prestige-laden quarterly The Geographical Journal, published by the Royal Geographical Society. Another 3C and farmers will be able to harvest maize in the western Highlands, it says. There is a downside or two, such as estuarial and coastal flooding, as sea levels rise. And also, according to Dr John Boardman of Oxford and a colleague, an erosion problem. He examined a field in the South Downs and predicted a 27 per cent increase in topsoil loss by 2050 because of extra rainfall. Meanwhile, the summers that triggered shrinkage in clays and subsidence in foundations also set the insurance market trembling. The insurers had presumed that baking hot summers such as that of 1976 - triggering clay shrinkage and subsidence - would happen perhaps once in every 1,000 years. But by 2050, according to John Doornkamp of Nottingham, such summers could occur every five years. Watch the premiums soar.

Full text: AN ECONOMIST from the US Environmental Protection Agency has forecast that by 2000, the cumulative retail value of pharmaceutical drugs based on plants will be $500 billion. This is about half of Britain's current GNP. A biodiversity-minded biologist points out that from now on every two years is likely to see the extinction of a plant with medicinal potential which he works out at a retail-market loss of $12 billion by 2050. Never mind the market, what about the value of lives saved? The OECD sets a value of $12.4 million on a human life, and plant-derived anti-cancer drugs save 90,000 lives a year (in the rich world). So the benefits of the plants used against cancer could be put at $1.1 million million. But most of these plants are found - and being extinguished - in the tropics, where the poor live and die. Glum sum: eventually, the Global Environment Facility of the World Bank might spend $1 billion a year on conservation.
MORE sums from the Americas: according to the Global Change Division of the US Environmental Protection Agency, if there were no controls on ozone destroying chemicals, there would be much more skin cancer from ultraviolet light the ozone layer is supposed to stop. The bill? Among Americans living now, or born by 2075, there would be an additional 354 million cases of skin cancer. The treatment of which, by 2165, would cost $40 million million. The cost of controlling the ozone-eaters however, is likely to total $36 billion, largely by 2000. Sounds like a healthy investment.

In recent years, the villagers of Gourna in southern Egypt have made their money from tourism. But the recent slump, in the wake of terrorist attacks, has made archaeologists nervous that villagers will turn to grave robbing from the 420 ancient tombs in the vicinity to make ends meet. The Egyptian Antiquities Organisation has come up with a drastic solution: it wants Gourna dismantled and its inhabitants moved to another village. Villagers are resistant. One resident said the government need not worry about the treasures. "They've gone and they went long ago," he said.

Abstract: Some say that's exactly why Elizabeth Dowdeswell, a former home ec teacher from rural Saskatchewan, is the right person to hold the world's top environmental job. While still in her early 30s, Ms Dowdeswell was made Saskatchewan's deputy minister of culture and youth. But she was fired when the Tory government came to power in 1982 and wanted its own stamp on cultural policy. When Mr. [Ian Wilson] retired in 1987, Ms Dowdeswell flew out from Ontario for the day to surprise him at his party.

Full text: It takes a strong person to shake up a global organization that's become set in its ways over two decades.
But some say that's exactly why Elizabeth Dowdeswell, a former home ec teacher from rural Saskatchewan, is the right person to hold the world's top environmental job.
She's the first woman to head the United Nations Environment Program, an agency with a $120-million two-year budget.
"She won't 'She has a sort of religious fervor -- she feels she can make a difference in the world."
Others remark on Ms Dowdeswell's tenacity, her people skills, her public speaking ability and her dedication to saving the planet and building peace.
Six months into her four-year term, Ms Dowdeswell has served notice to her staff of 800 from roughly 60 countries she intends to cause "constructive damage to the status quo."
Sustainable development
In a recent interview from New York, she said UNEP must become a catalyst for sustainable development, not just environmental protection. For any country, rich or poor, a healthy environment and a sound economy are inextricably linked.
UNEP has to take a new direction, she said. "There have to be a number of changes in what we do and how we do it."
For instance, she strongly feels UN environmental programs should be aimed more at women.
"In many developing countries, it's really the women who make the daily decisions. The way in which household fuel and water is used is largely the result of the women."
As well, UNEP's management practices have to "come into the 21st century," she said.
As an undersecretary general to UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Ms Dowdeswell, 48, is the highest-ranking Canadian and the most senior of only a handful of women in top UN positions.
"Too often I'm the only woman in the room and that's got to change," she said.
The latest figures, from 1991, showed there are only about 32 senior female managers in the UN secretariat. That's roughly one woman for every 10 men in those positions.
While the glass ceiling isn't gone, "It sure is cracking and she's evidence of that," said Joan Martin-Brown, a New York-based UNEP official.
She said Ms Dowdeswell's appointment in January was "particularly exciting" since it came on the heels of last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, which called women full partners in sustainable development and environmental management.
"The fact she's the boss is a strong signal that this wealth of capacity held by women cannot be left on the shelf."
Ms Dowdeswell is also executive director of Habitat, an agency which deals with problems of the world's cities and communities. She sees both agencies as "instruments of peace."
"It's disputes over natural resources that cause countries to go to war, and that triggers refugees to move from one place to another," she said.
"If we can make a dent in solving the problem of management of natural resources, then we have an opportunity to avoid conflict."
Though she is based in Nairobi, half her time is spent travelling. In one recent week, her job took her to four continents for meetings in New York, Nairobi, Paris and China.
That may seem like a long way from her roots in a string of small Saskatchewan towns.
Ms Dowdeswell's family moved to Canada from Northern Ireland when she was five. The eldest of eight children, she grew up with a sense of community and public service. Her father was a United Church minister and her mother a teacher.
She was active in 4-H and is remembered by former provincial 4-H supervisor Thelma Howard as an outstanding member who won many sewing awards and was "fun to have around." To this day, Ms Dowdeswell is said to design and sew her own clothes.
After graduating with a bachelor of science degree in home economics and a teaching certificate from the University of Saskatchewan, she worked in Swift Current for 10 years as a home ecconomics and drafting teacher, a guidance counsellor and adult education worker.
Vision, pragmatism
Those years gave her a combination of vision and pragmatism critical to her current work.
"With Saskatchewan people there is a vision that keeps you going, but a pragmatism about the day-to-day realities," she said.
In 1972, she earned a master's degree in behavior science at Utah State University. That landed her a job for a year teaching economics and marketing at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.
Ian Wilson, then Saskatchewan's deputy education minister, hired her as a consumer education consultant. She moved on to become the department's human rights ombudsman and was eventually put in charge of federal-provincial education matters.
Mr. Wilson, now chairman of the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology, says "Liz" was often highly disciplined and critical of herself, but could also laugh at herself.
Though often "scared out of her wits" having to publicly explain controversial policies, she came across as self-assured and dynamic.
While still in her early 30s, Ms Dowdeswell was made Saskatchewan's deputy minister of culture and youth. But she was fired when the Tory government came to power in 1982 and wanted its own stamp on cultural policy.
She headed to Ottawa, where she became a consultant to the Treasury Board, managing public inquiries such as those on water policy and weather services, as well as a royal commission on unemployment insurance.
"A lot of my life has been spent trying to bring the public into public policy-making," she said.
After directing the Ontario office of Environment Canada, Ms Dowdeswell moved up to assistant deputy environment minister in charge of the atmospheric environment service.
There she helped develop public services such as the ozone watch and the ultraviolet index. She was also Canada's representative to the World Meteorological Organization.
Mr. Wilson said Ms Dowdeswell's career moves have been motivated by "a sense of service and need. She has never really pushed or applied to do things. People ask, 'Would you do this?' And so she takes it on."
Key negotiator
She moved into the global spotlight as Canada's negotiator on the climate-change treaty signed at the Earth Summit.
"Everybody talked about Liz's ability to chair meetings," said Ms Bax. "She allowed each country to have its say, but ended up with a position that served everybody's interest."
Ms Dowdeswell can be "very cutting and very direct" but is not afraid to show a softer, caring side. "She would take the time to talk with staff when they're were having problems or grief over the loss of someone."
Despite her busy schedule, friends say she never forgets birthdays. And she's often generous and impulsive.
When Mr. Wilson retired in 1987, Ms Dowdeswell flew out from Ontario for the day to surprise him at his party.
Her marriage of almost 10 years broke up in the mid-1970s.
"Although she has lived alone, she is not a lonely person," said Mr. Wilson. She enjoys playing piano and singing with friends, but has little time for these interests now.
She has the "polish, sophistication and charm of a Jeanne Sauve" and would make a great ambassador some day, said Mr. Wilson.
But for now, Ms Dowdeswell has a job she loves.
"I feel I'm always learning. And I meet wonderful, wonderful people who really care about what's happening to this world."

Full text:   Do you spend $25 to clean up $20 worth of pollution? That`s what the experts are debating
MONTREAL - Let`s say a tonne of pollution does $20 of damage to the Earth`s climate. You could prevent that pollution, but it would cost you $25. Is it worth the cost?
In Montreal last week, economists and climate experts from 100 countries wrestled with the nitty-gritty of financing a cleaner Earth.
They`re dealing with greenhouse gases, the pollutants such as carbon dioxide that threaten to make the Earth`s climate hotter and shift patterns of rainfall in a few decades.
The problem is that carbon dioxide comes from burning coal, oil, gasoline and natural gas things that most societies say they can`t do without.
This is the first meeting of a new working group in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body tackling what may be the worst global environmental threat a harsher climate. Its report, due in 1995, will go to all the countries that signed the Climate Change Convention at last June`s Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
So far, the conference has been civil despite the controversial nature of debates about who should pay to prevent global pollution, and how much. "Just wait till the end of the week," predicted Jim Bruce, the Canadian who co-chairs the working group.
There are no answers yet in the conference`s big, garishly red and black auditorium on Sherbrooke Street just disquieting questions. These include:
* How much damage really results from carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas?
Estimates range from 30 cents to $65 of damage from every tonne of the carbon in carbon dioxide effects such as drought in farmland, severe storms and higher sea levels that would flood coastlines. (The conference has heard that $20 a tonne is the likeliest range.)
Scientists say we`re adding about 1.6 billion tonnes of carbon to the air each year, a rate that would raise global temperatures between 1.7 and 3.8 degrees in the next century.
* Is future damage likely to occur gradually? Some say yes, while others say warmer temperatures might have no effect for a while, until suddenly something snaps in the world`s climate.
Big insurance companies believe the sudden-snap theory, says Bruce. That`s because there were no disastrous storms with $1 billion of insurance losses before 1987, while there have been 15 of them since then.
* What if the cost of reducing pollution is greater than the cost of living with pollution? Do we try to limit the carbon dioxide levels in our air at any cost?
* Should we be as worried about an amount of damage to the environment 100 years from now as we would be if it occurred tomorrow?
* Assume that a hotter, drier climate would wipe out many of a country`s farms. These represent just three or four per cent of that country`s gross domestic product. Do we sacrifice the farms to keep bigger economic sectors healthy, or save them at enormous cost because people need food?
* How would carbon taxes work? These are taxes on fossil fuels based on the amount of carbon they produce.
For instance, a vehicle that burns 30 litres of gasoline a week produces about a tonne of carbon (in carbon dioxide) a year.
The working group`s job isn`t to tell world governments what to do, but to say, "Here are different theories of how to control carbon dioxide emissions, along with their costs and benefits."
It`s also been assigned the task of figuring out how much carbon dioxide the world`s factories, cars, furnaces and electrical generating stations are likely to pump out in the future.

Mother Earth gets hto under the collar Storm warning: [AM Edition]

Abstract: Hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes and other wind storms could be the climate's first signals of discomfort at the onset of global warning. And if predictions are right, as the Earth heats up the message could get a lot nastier. In the last 200 years we've poured 500 billion extra tons of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide into the air, creating a gaseous blanket around the Earth which soaks up light and heat. The resulting greenhouse effect has made the Earth's temperature rise half a degree, and most scientists expect it will shoot up a further 3 degrees Celsius by the year 2100. If this change seems small, it's not: the last ice age was caused by just a 5 degree dip in temperature. They fear what's known as a runaway greenhouse effect, a scenario where the planet overheats to the point that a host of dangerous side effects kick in, exacerbating the heating trend. This might occur if ice caps melted, releasing deep stores of frozen methane; areas of deep permafrost thawed releasing massive carbon stores; or phytoplankton, which plays a key role in absorbing carbon dioxide, was seriously depleted.

Full text: BEFORE LAST month's storm swept in from the Gulf of Mexico and deluged much of Eastern Canada and the United States, it struck the west coast of Florida, including a small barrier island where my friends and I were vacationing.
Hurricane-force winds tore down palm trees, smashed the concrete pool-side patio, shook the house and yanked sewage pipes open.
It felt at times as though the storm was directing a furious message at us, a premonition I discovered later may not be far off.
Climatologists and environmentalists now think that the recent surge in big storms may indeed be the Earth's attempt to tell us something.
Hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes and other wind storms could be the climate's first signals of discomfort at the onset of global warning. And if predictions are right, as the Earth heats up the message could get a lot nastier.
In the last 200 years we've poured 500 billion extra tons of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide into the air, creating a gaseous blanket around the Earth which soaks up light and heat. The resulting greenhouse effect has made the Earth's temperature rise half a degree, and most scientists expect it will shoot up a further 3 degrees Celsius by the year 2100. If this change seems small, it's not: the last ice age was caused by just a 5 degree dip in temperature.
Already there are worrying signs: Seven of the hottest years in human history have been in the last 10. There have been droughts; there have been food shortages; and there has been an upsurge in disastrous winds.
When Hurricane Gilbert devastated Jamaica and parts of Mexico in 1988, meteorologists said it could happen only once in a 100 years. Then came Hugo in 1989, also dubbed "hurricane of the century." Last September, both were topped by Andrew, which at more than $20 billion broke records in destruction.
Meanwhile, five unprecedented wind storms have swept over northwestern Europe, while four record-breaking cyclones have devastated Pacific islands.
To put this in human terms: in the 1960s and 1970s there were 14 natural disasters, each of which left more than 10,000 people homeless. In the 1980s, there were 70.
According to a science adviser at Canada's Atmospheric Environment Service, an upsurge in storms makes senses in a hotter world. It takes warm water (over 26 degrees) condensing and releasing moisture to fuel a tropical storm. So with oceans getting hotter, we can expect hurricanes to get bigger and for some to start further north.
This means Canadians may be in for bigger storms, especially in coastal areas. But the most noticeable short-term effect could be to raise insurance rates.
Munich Re, the world's largest re-insurance agency, recently warned: "For the first time in human history, mankind is about to change the climate significantly and possibly irreversibly, without having any idea of the consequences it will have."
It estimates global warming could cause natural disaster liabilities to rise from $20 billion to more than $100 billion a year. To compensate, some re-insurance corporations have hiked their rates by 300-500 per cent, while one company, the International Netherlands Group, has decided it can't afford to provide any insurance against natural disasters.
And massive wind storms may just be heralding worse to come.
A recent poll of 400 climate scientists conducted by the environmental group Greenpeace revealed that an alarming 45 per cent of them think that the end of the world, if not at hand, is a distinct possibility.
They fear what's known as a runaway greenhouse effect, a scenario where the planet overheats to the point that a host of dangerous side effects kick in, exacerbating the heating trend. This might occur if ice caps melted, releasing deep stores of frozen methane; areas of deep permafrost thawed releasing massive carbon stores; or phytoplankton, which plays a key role in absorbing carbon dioxide, was seriously depleted.
Nobody's saying these doomsday scenarios are certainties. As the Earth heats, climatologists are quick to point out they just don't know what will happen. The point is that they are all too real possibilities.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the major international committee of scientists studying global warming, believes we must cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 60 per cent to stop the warming trend.
Yet, as Kevin Jardine of Greenpeace points out, Canada continues to be among the nine largest producers of greenhouse gas. While the federal government has talked a good line, it hasn't acted on its promises, even its latest not to increase its output of carbon dioxide by the end of the century.
But even if Canada were to follow through on its commitments, it wouldn't be enough, according to Greenpeace and other environmental groups. The only long-term answer must be to invest in renewable energy alternatives - despite protests from the petroleum industry.
Faced with a crisis out of the realm of our experience, and almost our imagination, we can't say we haven't been warned. The message is being delivered by scientists, environmentalists, and recently by the Earth itself: The question is, how many more "storms of the century" will it take before we listen?

Full text:   Top UN post was a shocker SUCCESS STORY " Elizabeth Dowdeswell still finds it hard to believe that she is the highest-ranking woman, and Canadian, at the United Nations
Wednesday, April 21, 1993
JAMES RUSK
BY JAMES RUSK Environment Reporter THREE months after becoming both the highest-ranking Canadian and the highest-ranking woman at the United Nations, Elizabeth Dowdeswell is still in a state of disbelief.
"I pinch myself and say, 'Is this real?' " Ms. Dowdeswell said. "I grew up as a child with such respect for the United Nations, and I think that is true of so many Canadians. I can't believe I'm an undersecretary- general . . . at this moment in time when you can really make a difference."
From a start as a home economics teacher in 1966 in southwestern Saskatchewan, she has risen to be a UN undersecretary-general in New York and executive director of the UN's two Nairobi-based agencies, the UN Environment Program (UNEP) and Habitat, which deals with the problems of the world's cities.
Her appointment appears to be characteristic of the changes that Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is seeking to make in the organization.
All too often in the past, UN agencies such as UNEP have been headed by ex-politicians, who turned the agencies into personal fiefs in which they dispensed patronage and privilege and sought self-aggrandizement, all at the expense of both the UN purse and its ideals.
To stop this, Mr. Boutros-Ghali has sought out experienced public- sector managers as agency heads, leaders who can rebuild demoralized staffs, keep budgets in line and foster co-operation among international institutions, says David Runnalls of the Ottawa-based Institute for Research on Public Policy.
In tapping Ms. Dowdeswell, he turned to a seasoned public servant. The future undersecretary-general rose rapidly through the ranks in Saskatchewan and Ottawa after her marriage of almost 10 years broke up in the mid-1970s.
The daughter of a United Church minister in her native Saskatchewan, she grew up in a number of small towns throughout the province. After a brief stint as a teacher at the University of Alberta, she went to work for the Education Department in Saskatchewan, where she was in charge of rewriting the province's consumer-education curriculum. Later, she became the department's human-rights ombudsman, and finally was put in charge of federal-provincial educational matters.
After a period as deputy minister of culture and recreation, Ms. Dowdeswell moved to Ottawa and worked for the Treasury Board, was executive director of the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance and was director of the Ontario office of Environment Canada.
Her last post in Ottawa, before leaving for the United Nations, was as assistant deputy environment minister in charge of the atmospheric environment service, a post that brought her international attention as Canada's negotiator on the climate-change treaty signed at last June's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
"I've never predicted most of the jobs I've been in," Ms. Dowdeswell said of her eclectic career. "I've been very fortunate."
Along the way, she was involved in a number of public inquiries, the most important being the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance in the mid-1980s, an experience she sees as vital in her current post.
The institutional processes around the Earth Summit were unique. The UN formally involved non-governmental groups with an interest in the issues in both the preparations for the meeting and the meeting itself, and Canada even made non-governmental representatives official delegates to the meeting.
As Ms. Dowdeswell sees from the paper that flows across her desk, this process is becoming entrenched in the UN system, and UN managers will need to be able to find ways of listening to the world's people, as well as its governments, as they seek solutions to apparently intractable global problems.
Ms. Dowdeswell, a silver-haired woman of great presence and dignity who, one Environment Canada employee said, is "one of those people who you know is in the room even though she hasn't said a word," said that in her work she must balance two sets of challenges - one managerial, one substantive.
"Fundamentally, I don't believe that the world is best served by one- person institutions. What we need to be able to do is to harness and to mobilize all the resources that we bring to bear. We can't do that if policy making is done by one person and the views of the experts aren't heard."
To do this, she hopes that after four years at UNEP ("I say four years deliberately because that is my term, and I don't want to lose that sense of urgency") the organization will be "lean and mean but with the accepted intellectual power to always be at the leading edge."
UNEP, which is 20 years old, has created a global awareness of environmental problems, but in the wake of the Earth Summit it has to take on a new role as a partner with a whole range of institutions and individuals, Ms. Dowdeswell said.
"One of the hard things for UNEP to learn is that it is not a one-man show, that it is not the only game in town," she said, explaining that her senior staff members have been told that their performance appraisals will reflect their ability to play an effective role in UN processes in which the agency is not the leader.
As for her other operational agency, Habitat, of which she has been head for less than a month, Ms. Dowdeswell said it was a logical fit with environment, as many of the problems of cities in the developing world are environmental.
That does not mean they should be combined, but she expects that she can bring some efficiencies to the two groups. There is, for instance, no need for them to maintain separate sets of conference and translation services.

Abstract: What about the endangered cow? The endangered sheep? The endangered pig? The endangered . . . turkey? "I think people are more aware of the more exotic animals - the ones that capture the imagination," says Alan Regan, supervisor at Stanley Park's Children's Zoo, which includes a number of rare domestic breeds in its menagerie of horses, goats, sheep, geese, chickens, pigs, llamas and cows. Unquestionably, Regan's animal superstar is the startling, magical-looking Jacob four-horned ram. But others are here too: Dexter cattle, Pilgrim geese, Barbados Blackbelly sheep and this year, an honored guest: A rare - and pregnant - Tamworth pig.

Full text: Friday: How people help protect genetic diversity: Action, adventure and nurture.
I think we can safely say that most people have heard of the famous, endangered spotted owl of Pacific northwest old-growth forests.
And we probably all know about the endangered whale, bald eagle, Chinese panda and African elephant - and on and on.
But what about the endangered cow? The endangered sheep? The endangered pig? The endangered . . . turkey?
Yes, I'm afraid it's true, Virginia: Many turkeys ARE endangered. And no, it is definitely not a joke.
As with most of our planet's other resources, domestic farm animals have become victims of the high-production, short-term profit motive. And many are almost extinct: Just like the spotted owl.
"I think people are more aware of the more exotic animals - the ones that capture the imagination," says Alan Regan, supervisor at Stanley Park's Children's Zoo, which includes a number of rare domestic breeds in its menagerie of horses, goats, sheep, geese, chickens, pigs, llamas and cows.
The Children's Zoo belongs to the Rare Breeds Conservancy - which protects it from being simply a "zoo" (bad word). Now it's also a preserving and even, on a minor scale, breeding operation devoted to the survival of rare species (good words).
Unquestionably, Regan's animal superstar is the startling, magical-looking Jacob four-horned ram. But others are here too: Dexter cattle, Pilgrim geese, Barbados Blackbelly sheep and this year, an honored guest: A rare - and pregnant - Tamworth pig.
Why are creatures such as these important? "Genetically, we should not have all our eggs in one basket," says Regan with a smile. "As it were."
The rare breeds, you see, all have valuable characteristics it would be dangerous to lose. The Dexter cow, for example, is known as the "poor man's cow" because it can survive nicely on little pasture and food.
That Tamworth pig can rustle around, foraging for its own food. "That kind of adaptability - the lack of it - is one of the things you worry about with the established commercial breeds."
Basically, what happened was this: As recently as 30 years ago, a rich diversity of livestock breeds flourished on our lands. Modern agriculture, however, demanded specialization and the highest possible levels of productivity. Now a very few breeds fill all our needs - agriculture has become, in every sense of the word, "an industry".
Genetic diversity and flexibility ARE being lost. If climate change or a new disease wastes those few vulnerable breeds, we - as well as they - are in big trouble.
Preserving rare breeds is thus a survival strategy as well as an act of respect for our heritage: A kind of "insurance policy" to sustain and improve agriculture in the future.
The Rare Breeds Conservancy flyers and information newsletters point out that genetic conservation can be justified "on historical, cultural, aesthetic, recreational, biological, scientific, agricultural and economic grounds."
But there's something else, too. Something perfectly simple.
"It's nice to keep them anyway - for their own sake," says Regan. He surveys his little ark fondly. "You shouldn't always need an excuse to preserve things. It's a shame to let anything go."

Abstract: Nice to see that Glen Ford, 76, The Fastest Gun Alive, is still alive. But a second look at the Hello! snaps of his wedding (number four) to Jeanne Baus, 33, raise some doubts. He appears to be wearing rather more make-up than his bride. That, and the Happy Childhood Smile that almost brings an expression to his face, look strangely like the work of Mr Joyboy, the cosmetic mortician in Evelyn Waugh's The Loved One. His suit, shirt and tie are of the kind that button down the back. Glen's not been too well, what with the pneumonia and ulcer-related blood-clotting, but now he's in good, if slightly long-finger-nailed, hands. His lovely young bride was once his nurse - "the professional attention she provided turned into affection and gradually grew into love" - and she's seen tenderly ministering to her ex-patient with a large slice of cake.

Full text: 1. CRIME TIME
So now we know. Or, rather proudly in this new era of less understanding, we don't. Watching television leads to crime. As opposed to unemployment, which doesn't. But then again, if people had jobs, they might watch less television, and therefore commit less crime. And what of the proven link between television and unemployment, particularly if you are (a) chairman of the BBC or (b) an actor in Eldorado?
2. EYE OF THE NEEDLE
The merciful Kenneth Clarke is to review the system of heavier fines for the better off. This after "a pensioner" (nice emotive word), Norman Smith, was convicted of drinking and driving and was fined pounds 3,200 for a first offence, while a less
financially-fortunate second offender was fined pounds 76 by the same court. The aggrieved Mr Smith "publicised his complaint through a full-page ad in his local paper", thereby further publicising his wealth . . .
3. NEEDLE'S EYE WIDENED, LATEST!
Mr Smith's problem is that he is not rich enough. Otherwise, all he needs do is invite himself (and a few other wealthy folk dissatisfied with the law as it stands) to dinner at No 10, leaving the odd pounds 17 million under the saucer as a tip. Not that this would have the slightest influence on future legislation . . .
4. PROFIT OF DOOM
Greenpeace may have finally found an argument that hits home. Wind storm damage has soared, along with global warming, accounting for 85 per cent of insurance losses of $53 billion. According to Jeremy Leggatt, scientific director of Greenpeace: "It is clear that a healthy insurance industry will not be possible in a world in the grip of human-induced climate change." Minor considerations, such as the loss of human life or possibly the planet, melt no ice caps in the minds of the rich and powerful. But the loss of money? Particularly all that once-painless Lloyds lucre? Now you're talking.
5. NOT TONIGHT, FATIMA
Researchers keen to pursue the missing link between video and vice should hit the road to Morocco forthwith, if not fifthwith. There, Chief Police Commissioner Haj Mohammed Mustapha Tabet has been sentenced to death after confessing to sex "with more than 1,600 women in three years". The commissioner's a goner, but what of the upright (take that as you will) judiciary? Prosecutor Riahi helpfully showed the court "118 pornographic videos of Mr Tabet and his friends having sex with 518 women and girls". Call it one hour per video, and let's assume an eight-hour day - that's a solid fortnight's viewing, plus overtime. By now the cream of the Casablanca legal system must be either (a) potential sex criminals or (b) off the idea for life.
6. PILLOW BITER
Talking of which, the Daily Mail chose to illustrate an article on non-performing husbands pleading a headache with a picture of Doris Day and - yes - Rock Hudson.
7. TAKE-AWAY
Chris Patten speaks, Li Peng replies and the Hang Seng index drops 5 per cent in a day. Keep this up for a month and we'll have to pay the Chinese to take Hong Kong off our hands. What a shame Mr Patten's talents are confined to the Colonies. He could certainly give Norman Lamont a run for our money.
8. UP THE WALL
While on Wall Street, the latest topic is inflation. Once thought as dead as the Eighties, it's back, and it's in business. Last week, 150 investment managers attended a symposium on the subject, at a cost per head of $525. Crikey, 10 years ago, it wouldn't have been half that . . .
9. SAY GOODBYE!
Nice to see that Glen Ford, 76, The Fastest Gun Alive, is still alive. But a second look at the Hello! snaps of his wedding (number four) to Jeanne Baus, 33, raise some doubts. He appears to be wearing rather more make-up than his bride. That, and the Happy Childhood Smile that almost brings an expression to his face, look strangely like the work of Mr Joyboy, the cosmetic mortician in Evelyn Waugh's The Loved One.

Abstract: Mr [Norman Lamont] introduced it, rather cunningly, as if it were something forced on a reluctant Chancellor by the need to reduce carbon emissions in fulfilment of pledges made last June to the UN Convention on Climate Change at Rio. For this reason, Greenpeace yesterday welcomed the tax increases - even though they didn't go far enough and despite its preference for a carbon tax of the kind proposed by the EC but rejected by Britain. The EC praised Mr Lamont's taxes on energy and car usage as moving in the same direction as Community environment policies. The step also marks a big leap in the harmonisation of EC VAT rates.

Full text: WHICH measure in Norman Lamont's Budget achieved the unlikely miracle of uniting fiscal reformers, the European Commission and Greenpeace against the poverty lobby? His controversial decision to levy VAT of 17 1/2 per cent in stages on domestic gas and electricity. The move is expected to raise pounds 3 billion a year in revenue. And it is exactly the sort of measure which puts every liberal-minded person's prejudices into a mincing machine.
Mr Lamont introduced it, rather cunningly, as if it were something forced on a reluctant Chancellor by the need to reduce carbon emissions in fulfilment of pledges made last June to the UN Convention on Climate Change at Rio. For this reason, Greenpeace yesterday welcomed the tax increases - even though they didn't go far enough and despite its preference for a carbon tax of the kind proposed by the EC but rejected by Britain. The EC praised Mr Lamont's taxes on energy and car usage as moving in the same direction as Community environment policies. The step also marks a big leap in the harmonisation of EC VAT rates.
Fiscal reformers liked the Budget because it marked a further stage in the transfer of taxation from income to spending (as long as one ignores the increase in national insurance contributions). And anyway, increased taxation was inevitable for a country which has been living beyond its means (as witness a prospective budget deficit of pounds 50 billion) and paying its employed population much more than it has been earning for a number of years. Even now, at the end of the longest recession since the 1930s, average earnings are rising by almost five per cent - when all that is needed to maintain living standards is an increase of under one per cent. In the US, where unemployment is much lower, there has been hardly any increase in real earnings for a decade. Surely, argument blending with argument, the case for a tax increase is overwhelming?
Not quite. The trouble with putting VAT on energy is that it hits the poor dramatically more heavily than it hits the rich. As Fran Bennett points out on this page, the poorest fifth of households already spends more than twice as much of the weekly budget on fuel as the average household does. And, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the poorest households (with less than pounds 60 a week of disposable income) spend 14 per cent of their income on fuel - compared with three per cent by the very richest (over pounds 800 per week). So the poor are disproportionately, even viciously, hit by Mr Lamont's VAT decision. True, he has diluted instant criticism by pledging that means-tested benefits will rise to reflect the change; but he doesn't say by how much. And, as the IFS points out, those just above the means-tested benefit level, including millions of pensioners, will not be helped.
The Government's track record is not one to inspire trust among the poor. The Conservatives have effected a massive redistribution of income from rich to poor in the past decade without any obvious impact on economic growth. There are lives and much misery at stake here. Mr Lamont has to be better than his word here. He must be monitored rigorously to ensure that the poor are not kicked while they're down by a reform which otherwise has a lot going for it.

Abstract: As one who has devoted my life's work to the development of spirituality in my fellow humans and who unashamedly contends that organized religion is a most powerful tool for enhancing spiritual growth, I am highly distressed and saddened by recent events in Texas and Florida. More often than not, these misguided headline seekers believe they are special agents of the almighty with a unique calling that somehow makes OK the most atrocious and ungodly behavior imaginable. Please join with me in denouncing these recent cycles of terror and in exposing them for what they really are _ reprehensible acts of violence against both God and God's children. Wesley Vaughan, pastor South San Jose, Calif.

Full text: THE EDITORIAL PAGE; LETTERS
From Hurricane Hugo to Hurricane Andrew to this past weekend's blizzard, we are amazed by the increasing severity of our weather.
Yet, Vice President Al Gore's book, Earth in the Balance, predicted that global warming would result in more severe storms.
It appears that he was right.
We must all work together now, ordinary people, businesses, schools and governments worldwide, to protect our planet and its environment.
Our way of life, maybe even our lives, depends on it. Arthur M. Keller Palo Alto, Calif.
Worst of century? Bull
Was last weekend's storm really the worst of the century? Not in New York, it wasn't. Maybe in other places it was, but not in New York. My God, it was only 12 inches.
I remember that back in 1947 we had, on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, 26 inches of snow.
That was a storm. And we've had others _ 18, 19 inches. This was only 12.
It's the yuppies who run the media now; they're under 45 and have never seen a snowstorm or a northeaster in their lives.
They never went through what the old-timers went through in the '20s, '30s and '40s.
Also, the northeaster in December was like a thunderstorm compared with the 1938 hurricane in New York.
All the young people under 45 never have seen bad weather like we did in the old days.
I have to laugh when people say, "Oh, it's the worst I've seen." Charles Conran Great Neck, N.Y.
Target all bad habits
I was pleased to see the statistics regarding the general fitness of this country, printed in your Life section ("More of us losing battle of the bulge," Friday).
Why is it that while everyone can point to the burden smoking places on the system, no one seems to mention the 66% of the population that is overweight?
I was under the impression that arteries get clogged by improper diet and lack of exercise, which can lead to heart attacks, which result in angioplasty and bypass surgery.
I would guess these procedures would be expensive and are being covered by the health-insurance companies.
If the administration is going to add a "sin tax" to cigarettes and alcohol, I think we should tax McDonald's, Frito-Lay and Hershey's accordingly.
If we are to really solve our health-care problems, all aspects must be considered, not just the unpopular, easily targeted habits.
I am, by the way, a non-smoker. Pamela Hynes Rolling Meadows, Ill.
Terror in name of God
As one who has devoted my life's work to the development of spirituality in my fellow humans and who unashamedly contends that organized religion is a most powerful tool for enhancing spiritual growth, I am highly distressed and saddened by recent events in Texas and Florida.
With the dawning of each new day, one is bombarded with grisly headlines and horror stories about dreadful violence committed by deranged maniacs who actually claim to be acting on behalf of God.
More often than not, these misguided headline seekers believe they are special agents of the almighty with a unique calling that somehow makes OK the most atrocious and ungodly behavior imaginable.
This letter is an urgent plea to men and women of true faith and moderate temperament everywhere:
Please join with me in denouncing these recent cycles of terror and in exposing them for what they really are _ reprehensible acts of violence against both God and God's children. Wesley Vaughan, pastor South San Jose, Calif.

Abstract: Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, in a study published today - Climate Change and the Insurance Industry - is urging insurers to lobby against the fossil fuel industry. Dr Jeremy Leggett, scientific director of Greenpeace, said insurers were worried about the heavy climate-related losses. Greenpeace argues that such change, caused by the build-up in the atmosphere of gases such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, is likely to induce weather pattern change including cyclones such as Hurricane Andrew which hit Florida last year.

Full text: UK INSURERS are being warned that they could face financial ruin if they fail to react to the dangers of global warming.
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, in a study published today - Climate Change and the Insurance Industry - is urging insurers to lobby against the fossil fuel industry.
Dr Jeremy Leggett, scientific director of Greenpeace, said insurers were worried about the heavy climate-related losses.
The insurance industry has reacted to the recent string of climatic abnormalities, such as hurricanes and droughts, by sharply pushing up rates, decreasing cover, and increasing deductibles. In some cases, cover has been withdrawn. In Hawaii it is no longer possible for new householders to insure against storm damage. In Samoa, a "cyclone proof" certificate is required before insurance inquiries can be accepted.
Dr Leggett said: "Healthy economics are impossible without a healthy international insurance industry. It is becoming clear that a healthy insurance industry will not be possible in a world in the grip of human-induced climate change."
Greenpeace argues that such change, caused by the build-up in the atmosphere of gases such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, is likely to induce weather pattern change including cyclones such as Hurricane Andrew which hit Florida last year.
In the UK, the four-year drought in the South-east, which caused subsidence and cracking in many buildings, has been followed by heavy rains, which insurers fear may begin to cause the opposite problem of "heave".
Insurers are also worried about huge areas of East Anglia in danger of flooding because they are below the five-metre contour level. Some areas are on alert from flood risk once every five years, and the National Rivers Authority is warning against new building. In some cases, new buildings in these danger zones will be uninsurable.
One leading Lloyd's underwriter, whose syndicate specialises in reinsurance, said the issue would become critical if the reinsurers, who tend to be badly hit first, start to withdraw cover. And he said that since 1989, the reinsurance rates for insuring companies in the US have shot up by 400 per cent, in the UK by 600 per cent and in Japan by 1,000 per cent.
"But I'm not too hopeful of the insurance industry being a good lobbier for change. It is too fragmented and too conservative," he said.
A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said the industry was still assessing the impact of global warming. "Anyway, it has its upside - the warmer winters have meant fewer burst pipes."

Abstract: LONDON (AP) - The environmental group Greenpeace said yesterday that global warming might have stirred the recent spate of hurricanes that have run up billions of dollars in losses for insurance companies. Greenpeace said in a report it hopes the insurance industry will become its ally in the global warming debate with the fossil fuels industry, which disputes environmentalists' claims that the "greenhouse effect" is dangerously heating up the planet. Greenpeace blames the burning of such fuels, including oil, for global warming. Greenpeace scientific director Jeremy Leggett presented his findings to a group of Lloyd's underwriters at their request last week.

Full text: LONDON (AP) - The environmental group Greenpeace said yesterday that global warming might have stirred the recent spate of hurricanes that have run up billions of dollars in losses for insurance companies.
One of those insurers, Lloyd's of London, agreed the idea makes sense. But one climatologist expressed strong doubts, saying all available 20th century data on hurricanes shows the biggest ones have come along in cooler years, while warm weather tends to bring a greater number of milder storms.
Greenpeace said in a report it hopes the insurance industry will become its ally in the global warming debate with the fossil fuels industry, which disputes environmentalists' claims that the "greenhouse effect" is dangerously heating up the planet. Greenpeace blames the burning of such fuels, including oil, for global warming.
Greenpeace scientific director Jeremy Leggett presented his findings to a group of Lloyd's underwriters at their request last week.
"They're beginning, I think, to panic," Leggett said in a telephone interview yesterday.
Lloyd's and other insurers, including many in the United States, have suffered staggering losses in recent years. A $20 billion blow came from Hurricane Andrew, which hit the Miami area last year.
Scientists disagree over whether global warming actually has begun, but nearly all scientists agree that the possibility of global warming is a serious threat.
Leggett acknowledged it is impossible to prove whether recent warmer temperatures are caused by the accumulation of such gases as carbon dioxide or merely a fluke fluctuation.
But if consumption of fossil fuels has indeed begun a trend of higher temperatures, the planet could be in for more wind storms that will cause increasing amounts of damage, he said.
"The insurance industry has started to wake up to the threat that climate change poses to its profitability," Leggett said in the report. "Some industry analysts are looking at the results of climate modeling and wondering how much of their current misfortunes can be put down to human-induced climate change."
Greenpeace found a receptive audience for its theories at Lloyd's, the huge insurance market.
"We're not experts on the weather," said a Lloyd's spokesman. "We note Greepeace says it could be changing for the worse and we know bills have been going up ... premiums have inevitably got to rise."
The Lloyd's spokesman declined to discuss any other factors that could have contributed to the big losses. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
Critics of Greenpeace's stance point out that coastal areas have become increasingly built up by developers, leading to an inevitable increase in damage whenever a hurricane strikes.

The Insurers Bet on Global Warming: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: Then there was Cyclone Ofa in 1991, the biggest tropical storm ever seen in the South Pacific. And Cyclone Val a year later, which devastated both Western Samoa and American Samoa, and Cyclone Iniki last autumn, the strongest to hit Hawaii in over a century. The sea's surface has to be a minimum of 27 degrees Celsius, in fact. So if there are more and bigger tropical storms around than ever before, then more of the sea's surface must be at least 27 degrees, or the same area stays that temperature longer, or both. Then early last year Sir John Houghton, former head of the Meteorological Office and now chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released a report saying that things are probably even worse than they seem. Volcanic dust from the Mount Pinatubo eruption and sulphur dioxide from power stations, he suggested, are temporarily cooling the planet and masking the greenhouse effect.

Full text: London. -- "The waves now are fantastically high on average," said Sheldon Bacon of the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences in England last August. "And why? Goodness knows. What pings around in the brain is the greenhouse effect."
Mr. Bacon was discussing the astounding fact that wave heights in the North Atlantic Ocean have risen by fully 25 percent over the past quarter-century, although average wind speeds have remained steady. That doesn't make any sense, and Mr. Bacon suspects that global warming is to blame.
But he can't prove it. The global interactions between sun, atmosphere, land areas and seas are so ferociously complex that nobody can even produce a reliable 30-day forecast of the weather, let alone a 30-year forecast of the climate.
Almost everybody fears that the extra carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse gases" released by human industrial and agricultural activities will change the global climate. But you can't even be certain what is happening in the present, given how much global temperature fluctuates from one year to another. Now, however, we have a different way of measuring warming: money.
The trillion-dollar global insurance industry takes a keen interest in weather patterns, because it naturally wants to limit large pay-outs to cover storm damage. The cost of Hurricane Andrew, which struck the U.S. Gulf Coast last year, for example, was around $20 billion.
Hurricane Andrew, by traditional standards, was a "100-year storm," a once-in-a-lifetime event. But so was Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, the strongest-ever Caribbean storm, and Hurricane Hugo in 1989 ($6 billion insured losses).
Then there was Cyclone Ofa in 1991, the biggest tropical storm ever seen in the South Pacific. And Cyclone Val a year later, which devastated both Western Samoa and American Samoa, and Cyclone Iniki last autumn, the strongest to hit Hawaii in over a century.
Last year Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, commissioned a report on windstorm damage. It found its worst suspicions confirmed. Total economic losses from windstorm damage in the '80s were three times greater than in the '60s. Insured losses were five times greater. "We definitely have a trend which, without exaggeration, may be regarded as dramatic," concluded the report's authors.
What does this have to do with global warming? Like the mysteriously bigger waves in the North Atlantic, more and bigger storms give us no direct proof of temperature change. But tropical storms require a tremendous amount of energy, which means that they can only form over warm water.
The sea's surface has to be a minimum of 27 degrees Celsius, in fact. So if there are more and bigger tropical storms around than ever before, then more of the sea's surface must be at least 27 degrees, or the same area stays that temperature longer, or both.
The actual change in sea temperature may be slight, but the results are already quite dramatic. Not only are traditional hurricane regions getting an unprecedented battering, but Western Europe has been hit repeatedly by near-hurricane storms in the past few years.
The Munich Re report predicts that it will just go on getting worse, with full-scale hurricanes visiting Western Europe and the Mediterranean for the first time in recorded history. If the insurance industry does not change the way it assesses storm damage risk, it concludes, "catastrophe" payments will rapidly escalate from $20 billion to $100 billion a year.
What the insurance industry cannot tell us, unfortunately, is how much warming, and how fast: it's like a canary in a coal-mine. And the specialists are still confused and divided among themselves.
In 1989, for example, the British Meteorological Office predicted that global warming would amount to 3 degrees Celsius over the next 70 years. But in 1991 the same group of meteorologists revised their forecast downwards by half, predicting that it would be only 1.5 degrees warmer by 2060.
Then early last year Sir John Houghton, former head of the Meteorological Office and now chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released a report saying that things are probably even worse than they seem. Volcanic dust from the Mount Pinatubo eruption and sulphur dioxide from power stations, he suggested, are temporarily cooling the planet and masking the greenhouse effect.
But when the volcanic dust washes out with the rain, and sulphur dioxide emissions are cut by the scrubbers that power stations everywhere are now having to install, we may suddenly discover that the planet got a lot hotter while we weren't looking. "It will be like a curtain being drawn back to let in the sunlight," one scientist said.
How much warmer? How fast? Who knows? But a poll of climate scientists taken a year ago revealed that 13 percent now believe that an unstoppable "runaway" greenhouse effect is likely, and another 32 percent think it is possible. We live in interesting times.

One implication of all this is that you should think twice before buying coastal property below the five-metre contour line. Insurance costs may rise very rapidly in coming years, if indeed insurance coverage is available at all. The other, larger implication is that global warming is indeed under way.
What the insurance industry cannot tell us, unfortunately, is how much warming, and how fast: it's like a canary in a coal-mine. And the specialists are still confused and divided among themselves.

The whole issue remains highly controversial, which is hardly surprising given the scientific complexity of the question and the immense amounts of money at stake. But the insurance industry is a usefully impartial source of evidence, and it suggests that warming is already a fact.
How much warmer? How fast? Who knows? But a poll of climate scientists taken a year ago revealed that 13 per cent now believe that an unstoppable "runaway" greenhouse effect is likely, and another 32 per cent think it is possible.

Full text: LIFE WILL BE "greener" under the Bill Clinton-Al Gore administration when it comes to energy and the environment.
But dramatic shifts in policy may not occur swiftly because of vexing choices and built-in resistance awaiting the new government.
By many accounts, this is a turning point: The shifting global economy, climate change and destruction of the atmosphere from pollution could compel a new, more sustainable way of living.
Some of the changes brewing could be as profound as those accompanying the end of the Cold War: weaning ourselves from foreign oil, shifting to solar power and renewable energy, eliminating waste in factories and in the home.
Vice President-elect Gore has talked of phasing out the internal combustion engine one day. Much sooner, he wants a Marshall Plan, or massive program, to clean up environmental messes around the world.
Clearly, the new generation in Washington has created many expectations.
"We are optimistic that this administration will take environmental issues very seriously and not present confrontation between environmental and economic goals, as in the past," said Christopher Flavin, vice president of Worldwatch Institute, an organization that advocates some new approaches.
Some of those who could feel the sting of new approaches are resigned to their inevitability.
Referring to stricter rules on pesticides, Chet Dickerson, Monsanto Co.'s director of agricultural affairs in Washington, said: "Threat might not be the right word. It may be long-term reality."
But questions remain as to how quickly things will, and should, change:
Clinton's Cautious Style
As a senator, Gore became an environmental advocate. But President-elect Clinton will be calling the shots, and he may not be so ambitious. As governor of Arkansas, he seldom put a priority on energy and the environment. Indeed, Arkansas' land and rivers suffered during Clinton's 12-year stewardship.
Rather than commanding change, Clinton is more likely to use market forces, such as urging industries to trade pollution credits to reduce industry-wide pollution. He is expected to consider tax incentives for energy conservation.
Carol M. Browner, Clinton's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency, worked during her confirmation hearing this week to mollify critics.
"The EPA should promote and encourage rewards for businesses that take the lead in developing pollution prevention and recycling strategies," she said.
Pollution-control advocates don't know what to expect. Clinton "may turn out to behave more like a moderate Republican, at least at first," said Ken Cook, vice president of the Center for Resource Economics, which deals with environmental issues in farming. "And that might be OK, since we have a lot of catching up to do."
Mixed Signals
Clinton won praise from pollution-control advocates for picking Browner as EPA administrator and Bruce Babbitt as interior secretary. Browner fought to protect the Everglades as Florida's chief environmental officer; Babbitt, a former governor of Arizona, has headed the League of Conservation Voters.
But Clinton's choice of Hazel R. O'Leary as secretary of the Energy Department is a different story. As an executive of Northern States Power Co. of Minnesota, she has pushed coal-fired and nuclear power plants.
Her company was a partner in an ill-fated plan last year to build the coal-fired plant in Florida near Lake Okeechobee - a plan that Browner helped kill.
O'Leary has angered American Indians in Minnesota for campaigning personally to store more nuclear waste at her company's Prairie Island nuclear plant. The plant is adjacent to Sioux Indian land on an island in the Mississippi River.
"We really question why they would appoint someone who has been involved with the nuclear industry like this," said Tom Goldtooth, environmental coordinator for the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians in Minnesota.
New Ideas, Same Game
The administration and many members of Congress may be new. But the real power on Capitol Hill has changed little. Likewise, the lobbying that accompanies the perennial battles over natural resources has changed little.
If Clinton gets around to pushing higher fuel economy requirements for vehicles, he will have to contend with Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and protector of the auto industry.
When it comes to limiting oil use, Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., will have a lot to say. Likewise, Clinton's treasury secretary, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, did not look benevolently on providing tax incentives for renewable energy sources when he was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
"The danger is getting bogged down in some of the same old fights," remarked Flavin.
Little Money; Other Priorities
With another huge budget deficit looming, the Clinton-Gore administration will be strapped as far as innovations.
The EPA alone received $110 million this year from what was requested. And the price tag for cleaning up radioactive messes at defense plants around the country has grown by hundreds of millions.
Blake Early, a Sierra Club lobbyist, said that he is preparing to rely on more favorable interpretations of old laws rather than expecting new programs.
"I don't expect this administration to be lobbing out a lot of new initiatives," Early said.
Chet Dickerson, Monsanto Co.'s director of agricultural affairs in Washington, believes that the economy and health care will consume the brunt of attention in the early going.
"I don't think that the Clinton administration will want to jump into some of these controversial areas," Dickerson said. "`Next year? Our jobs could be tougher."
Even before taking office, Clinton's administration has signaled some of the likely changes. Natural gas is likely to be seen more favorably as an alternative to oil, coal and other fossil fuels, judging by Clinton's associates.
Lawyers who work for natural gas interests held influential positions in Clinton's transition planning. Clinton's chief of staff, Thomas F. "Mack" McLarty, until recently was chairman of Arkla Inc., a natural gas company.
Some environmental advocates have come to prefer clean-burning natural gas over some of the other fuels. But they worry that Clinton's administration might become so dependent on natural gas that it fails to provide sufficient incentives to speed the era of renewables.
Attitudes toward oil might be affected by the devastating spill this month in the North Atlantic that damaged the Shetland Islands. The accident occurred even as the oil industry was negotiating to water down hull standards for tanker ships.
"The disaster underscores our continuing vulnerability as a nation in relying on shipments of imported oil," observed Jack Doyle, an analyst with Friends of the Earth, an international organization.
Early in Clinton's term, energy policy may well be tax policy. As a presidential candidate, Clinton opposed a gasoline tax. But he recently said that he might accept a hike in the 14-cent federal gas tax if it were accompanied by tax breaks for the middle class.
Changing Decisions
Government agencies expect new ways of doing business and are making decisions that might be different two weeks from now.
Last week, the EPA approved a test-burn at a new hazardous waste incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio. Gore has made few waves during the transition. But he has asked for an investigation on why the government allowed the incinerator to be built.
Shortly after the November election, the Department of Agriculture relaxed rules covering outdoor testing of genetically engineered crops. And in November, the EPA dropped some of the rules for testing the effects of pesticides on birds and other creatures.
These decisions foreshadow struggles on the horizon. The biotechnology industry - which uses gene-splicing to create products - escaped new statutes that would govern it during the Reagan-Bush era. Instead, existing laws were modified to cover areas that were quite different from what Congress had in mind.
The industry now worries about more regulation from the Food and Drug Administration and less protection of patents under the new administration.
"Biotechnology is at a crucial stage in its development," Stephen A. Duzan, chairman of an industry trade association, wrote in a letter to Clinton this month.
Rules governing pesticides could be in for drastic overhaul. The new administration will be looking closely at a federal court decision in California that could require banning of many pesticides. In the so-called Delaney case, a federal court ruled that pesticides cannot be used if they have been shown to cause cancer in lab animals.
While chemical manufacturers could suffer, waste disposal operators may prosper under Clinton. The $1.5 billion air pollution control industry alone could grow 8 to 14 percent in the next few years, analysts say.
Waste disposal companies worry about curbs on waste burning and stricter rules for landfills and transportation. But they are optimistic about the business that may come their way under an administration concerned about pollution.
"What they're going to do is going to be a plus for us and anybody else who gets revenues dealing with environmental problems," said William Y. Brown, a vice president of Waste Management Inc., the biggest disposal company.
Stronger Enforcement
While taking it slow on new programs, Clinton's administration is likely to enforce regulations that have been delayed or ignored.
For instance, federal farming law requires those who farm erodable land to have conservation plans by next year in order to partake of subsidies, crop insurance and many federal programs. The provision has particular bearing in the hills of Missouri, where crops are planted on sloping land.
Similarly, advocates of sustainable farming are frustrated at roadblocks to shifting away from heavy chemical use. Another federal program that was established to certify organic farms couldn't operate very effectively last year: It received $15,000 from the administration of President George Bush.
Betty Bailey, director of the North Carolina-based Rural Advancement Fund, said that she was hoping for new policies that look to the future.
"Many things could be changed in the first 100 days," she said.
Wilderness advocates are breathing easier these days. They no longer worry about threats to millions of acres of wetlands contained in a proposal to change definitions. They are shifting now from defense to offense, planning for strong language in a newly drawn Endangered Species Act.
And Clinton, following through on a campaign promise, is preparing to hold a forest summit in the Northwest soon after becoming president. He will be stepping into a long-running fight about cutting trees.
Scott Feierabend of the National Wildlife Federation said he sees a new atmosphere along with the new approach that the Clinton-Gore team is bringing to town. Many industries fighting to protect jobs and subsidies might not agree.
Feierabend said, "There seems to be a whole new mentality of cooperation rather than combativeness."

Full text: Today The Journal Editorial Board reaffirms its priorities on local, state, national and worldwide issues. We offer them as a clear statement of what The Milwaukee Journal stands for.
We are strongly independent, bearing no allegiance to political party or special interest. Our aim is tough-minded realism, not orthodoxy. We believe in civil liberties, representative government and equal opportunity. We support both free enterprise and sensible government action. We emphasize responsibility
civic as well as personal.
We are well aware that achieving such goals requires the sustained labor of many diverse forces. The Journal adds its voice to those efforts.
Local and state
Crime control
Support appropriate funding for law enforcement, criminal prosecution and punishment of criminals in both community and institutional settings. Provide testing and treatment of all criminals for alcoholism and other drug abuse. Encourage greater concern for crime victims, including the broader use of restitution orders to compensate victims. Campaign for tighter gun controls. Work to restore neighborhoods as safe places to live and conduct business.
Gambling
Draw the line on gambling in Wisconsin. Beef up enforcement of gambling laws. Expand help for addicted bettors. Promote other forms of economic development on Indian reservations.
Tax reform
Support affordable approaches to local property-tax relief, including greater state funding of public schools and other mandated services; a reduction in tax exemptions; the elimination of inefficient spending; greater sharing of services and cooperation among governments; and the enactment of tax alternatives, such as county sales taxes and surcharges on entertainment tickets.
Race relations
Confront personal prejudices, discourage stereotyping and promote tolerance. Encourage integration of housing, schools and employment, with public service jobs and affirmative action programs where necessary. Prod lenders to root out bias and step up financing of minority-owned firms. Support and enforce strong civil rights laws. Promote self-help efforts among minorities.
Jobs
Encourage economic expansion to create family-supporting jobs. Foster a business commitment to retraining and education to keep the work force productive. Improve job training for minorities and push to locate more state employment in Milwaukee's inner city.
Education
Promote innovation in education and demand greater accountability by educators for pupil performance, particularly in Milwaukee Public Schools, with emphasis on closing the achievement gap between white and minority students. Encourage greater parental involvement in schools. Demand wholehearted efforts to improve discipline and cut truancy and dropout rates.
Quality of life
Foster and safeguard high-quality-of-life features in the Milwaukee metropolitan area, such as first-rate artistic, sports and recreational opportunities. Support the construction of a new stadium for the Milwaukee Brewers and protect such major community assets as Milwaukee's public museum, zoo, symphony and ballet.
Balanced urban development
Support the renewal of neighborhoods and improve Milwaukee's downtown and lakefront, while preserving open spaces and historically significant buildings. Promote cooperation by Milwaukee and its suburbs to improve mass transportation, housing and job opportunities. Encourage land-use policies that stem urban sprawl and keep development in sync with public services.
Nation and world
Domestic needs
Reallocate unneeded military funds so as to increase investment in education, health, housing, police and infrastructure, especially in cities with decaying environments and widespread poverty.
Campaign reform
Reduce the impact of big money and interest groups on public policy by limiting campaign spending and boosting public funding of elections. Support reforms to enable any citizen, regardless of means or connections, to run for office.
Health
Replace the nation's shamefully inadequate medical care system with an equitably financed plan for national health insurance that (1) assures everyone of a decent minimum level of coverage, irrespective of income, and (2) curbs the rapid growth of health care costs.
Welfare reform
Overhaul welfare programs from top to bottom, on the premise that the poor want jobs and job training, not handouts. Relieve state and local welfare costs by shifting most funding to the federal government. Eliminate incentives for recipients to relocate by setting uniform benefits.
Child protection
Renew efforts to improve the health, education and basic welfare of every American child, regardless of race or economic situation. Encourage government policies that strengthen families and foster parental responsibility.
Sexual responsibility
Encourage responsible attitudes toward sexuality, including abstinence from sex except within a committed relationship. Support aggressive efforts to reduce adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease.
Economic and tax policy
Reduce the federal deficit through (1) cuts in non-essential programs, (2) aggressive collection of unpaid taxes and (3) where necessary, a boost in income taxes on an ability-to-pay basis. Encourage balanced economic growth, stressing greater savings, investment and productivity.
Balanced transportation
Urge more efficient use of existing facilities. Promote mass transit and van- and car-pooling. Give priority in highway projects to the elimination of safety hazards. Resist excessive construction likely to encourage wasteful land use.
International leadership
Promote the worldwide development of democratic governments that respect human rights and permit self-determination by their peoples. Foster cooperative efforts by industrial countries to help Third World nations help themselves. Support the United Nations as the chief arbiter of international disputes and coordinator of international health and economic assistance.
Trade
Promote trade that is both free and fair. Eliminate artificial barriers and encourage productive investment abroad, particularly development that serves the needs of Third World peoples.
Energy policy
Promote greater energy conservation to reduce dependency on foreign oil, rather than expanded energy production in environmentally sensitive areas. Beef up research into energy alternatives.
Environment
Encourage more aggressive US leadership on environmental issues, including the fight against ozone depletion and global warming. Insist that international lending policies promote environmentally sensitive development. Pursue resource conservation, recycling and the elimination of toxic substances from air, land and water. Back tougher policies to prevent agricultural and urban runoff into waterways.
Military preparedness
Review the purposes and funding of the US armed forces. Clearly define strategic American interests in the post-Cold War era and maintain military flexibility sufficient to their defense. Abandon wasteful and unnecessary arms programs, seeking particularly to dismantle unneeded nuclear weapon systems in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse. Oppose the proliferation of nuclear arms technology. Support international restrictions on the sale of conventional arms.

Abstract: They are right, of course. The U.S. educational system long ago turned corrupt, interested more in its own security and self-preservation than in responding to the changing nature of work. In the economic war to remove America away from 19th-century institutions and practices, it will be the last bastion of resistance. In addition, U.S. institutions that depend on receiving the long-term income streams of Americans are being hurt. If one cannot be assured of a long-term employment arrangement because of rapid changes in the work force, one is less apt to take out mortgages and make expensive purchases, such as a car. U.S. firms hoping to survive in the turbulent world ahead also should re-examine their employment practices. While they may succeed in reducing their work forces or slashing benefit costs, they may pay for it later in reduced sales and profits as companies emulate each other with layoffs.

Full text: Washington. -- Perhaps one of the most important things about the economic teach-in down in Little Rock last week is the way in which the president-elect is redefining job security.
He said it often during the campaign. Times have changed so much that it will now be necessary for individuals to undergo lifetime training and education, to be prepared to change jobs and maybe careers several times over a lifetime.
The transitory nature of employment is something that now may seem obvious to millions who have experienced or witnessed the breathtaking number of layoffs and restructurings of recent months.
But the full implications of it still have not been digested by the population, although politicians like Bill Clinton seem to understand them well. In his Little Rock "therapy" session designed to educate the American people, he began to explore the real meaning of the way the employment "contract" has been altered.
If there is no such thing as job security, then who will take up the slack, if indeed anyone or any institution can take up the slack? The obvious answer is government. More benefits associated with job security will move directly into the public sector.
The health-insurance debate provides a ready example. As costs have gone stratospheric, companies are cutting back on this important benefit, or laying off workers to reduce costs. But many people feel that they can't go without insurance protection against rising medical costs. When they are laid off, they are forced to pay enormous premiums from a shrunken budget to keep the insurance going.
So it is only natural that they should turn to government to provide some measure of security and fairness to an area over which they have no control. Health insurance is seen widely as a new federal guaranteed entitlement. There will be political hell to pay if the Clinton administration cannot deliver.
Pension benefits are in the same category. Although the law now provides for pension vesting and some portability as people move from job to job, employers have scaled back pension plans.
Pressure will build on Congress to add more security in this area, perhaps by expanding individual retirement accounts and taking a sharp look at the entire pension law. Secretary of the Treasury-designate Lloyd Bentsen is especially sensitive to helping future retirees through more tax benefits.
The end of job security is something that was apparent to young people long ago. Much of the pessimism and cynicism of the current age feeds back to this realization. They rightly conclude that the economic system, including their educational institutions that are supposed to train them for the world of work, has let them down.
They are right, of course. The U.S. educational system long ago turned corrupt, interested more in its own security and self-preservation than in responding to the changing nature of work. In the economic war to remove America away from 19th-century institutions and practices, it will be the last bastion of resistance.
America's educational system seems to have no coherent idea of how to train workers for a lifetime. It will gladly open its doors and take the tuition money, but beyond this, it has ceded all responsibility. A few enlightened educators understand that programs and concepts have to be organized, and curricula adapted, but a truly effective plan is hard to find.
The demise of job security also is devastating to the notion of free markets. One need only look to the former Soviet Union to understand this. When the free market fails to deliver or promises a harsh future, faith in it diminishes rapidly. Many people understandably look for government intervention.
A legitimate question is whether American society can function peaceably and efficiently with job security on the wane. The in-and-out worker tends to be less altruistic, less community-oriented, more apt to put the blame on others.
In addition, U.S. institutions that depend on receiving the long-term income streams of Americans are being hurt. If one cannot be assured of a long-term employment arrangement because of rapid changes in the work force, one is less apt to take out mortgages and make expensive purchases, such as a car.
As we have seen in the current economic sluggishness, lack of financing feeds back negatively on many other jobs, such as construction and automobile assembly. At the very worst, diminished job security leads where one might expect: deflation. And if you have a bit of an equity stake in something, be it a home or a financial asset, deflation is not good.
It behooves the Clinton administration to take a careful look at programs and policies which, if they can't enhance job security, will at least help offset these devastating impacts on our country.
U.S. firms hoping to survive in the turbulent world ahead also should re-examine their employment practices. While they may succeed in reducing their work forces or slashing benefit costs, they may pay for it later in reduced sales and profits as companies emulate each other with layoffs.
In the long term, will such a new climate change the American people? That's the ultimate, provocative question. The U.S. work force has been too linked to organizations in the past and perhaps needs to become more innovative and entrepreneurial in its own right.
The Japanese became economic powerhouses by overcoming their own disadvantages; in fact, they turned them into advantages. Once again we would do well to copy the Japanese.

Pressure will build on Congress to add more security in this area, perhaps by expanding individual retirement accounts and taking a sharp look at the entire pension law. Secretary of the Treasury-designate Lloyd Bentsen is especially sensitive to helping future retirees through more tax benefits.
The end of job security is something that was apparent to young people long ago. Much of the pessimism and cynicism of the current age feeds back to this realization. They rightly conclude that the economic system, including their educational institutions that are supposed to train them for the world of work, has let them down.
They are right, of course. The U.S. educational system long ago turned corrupt, interested more in its own security and self-preservation than in responding to the changing nature of work. In the economic war to remove America away from 19th Century institutions and practices, it will be the last bastion of resistance.
America's educational system seems to have no coherent idea of how to train workers for a lifetime. It will gladly open its doors and take the tuition money, but beyond this, it has ceded all responsibility. A few enlightened educators understand that programs and concepts have to be organized, and curricula adapted, but a truly effective plan is hard to find.
The demise of job security also is devastating to the notion of free markets. One need only look to the former Soviet Union to understand this. When the free market fails to deliver or promises a harsh future, faith in it diminishes rapidly. Many people understandably look for government intervention.
A legitimate question is whether American society can function peaceably and efficiently with job security on the wane. The in-and-out worker tends to be less altruistic, less community oriented, more apt to put the blame on others.
In addition, U.S. institutions that depend on receiving the long-term income streams of Americans are being hurt. If one cannot be assured of a long-term employment arrangement because of rapid changes in the work force, one is less apt to take out mortgages and make expensive purchases, such as a car.
As we have seen in the current economic sluggishness, lack of financing feeds back negatively on many other jobs, such as construction and automobile assembly. At the very worst, diminished job security leads where one might expect: deflation. And if you have a bit of an equity stake in something, be it a home or a financial asset, deflation is not good.
It behooves the Clinton administration to take a careful look at programs and policies which, if they can't enhance job security, will at least help offset these devastating impacts on our country.
U.S. firms hoping to survive in the turbulent world ahead also should re-examine their employment practices. While they may succeed in reducing their work forces or slashing benefit costs, they may pay for it later in reduced sales and profits as companies emulate each other with layoffs.
In the long term, will such a new climate change the American people? That's the ultimate, provocative question. The U.S. work force has been too linked to organizations in the past and perhaps needs to become more innovative and entrepreneurial in its own right.
The Japanese became economic powerhouses by overcoming their own disadvantages; in fact, they turned them into advantages. Once again we would do well to copy the Japanese.

Abstract: Brian Ketcham and Charles Komanoff don't hate cars. Honest, they don't. Ketcham even has a 1987 Honda Accord that he keeps in a garage in Cobble Hill. Brian Ketcham, 53, is an old Lindsay administration hand, who these days has a transportation-consulting firm in Brooklyn. Komanoff, 45, is an economist who runs an energy-consulting firm in Manhattan. Under the auspices of the environmental group Transportation Alternatives, these two consultants have put together one prodigious piece of work. "Far from being punitive to motorists, this approach will benefit motorists and non-motorists alike," Komanoff and Ketcham write. "In addition to improving existing roads, it will encourage some highway traffic to shift to alternatives such as subways, rail freight, carpooling, company vans, bicycling, walking and teleconferencing."

Full text:   Brian Ketcham and Charles Komanoff don't hate cars. Honest, they don't. Ketcham even has a 1987 Honda Accord that he keeps in a garage in Cobble Hill.
"Thirty-six hundred dollars a year," he said yesterday. Ketcham has no choice but to pay this money in full, the same way he had to pay to buy the car in the first place and the same way he has to pay the gas and the insurance bills.
It all adds up, of course. But the deeper truth is that all that barely begins to cover the true cost of having a car in New York.
And not just for the poor drone who happens to drive it. For the rest of us, too: Those of us who pay the taxes that pave the roads. Those of us who hire the cops who catch the speeders. Those of us who breath the stinky air the cars spew out. Those of us who put our very lives on hold, for many hours a year, going nowhere in interminable traffic jams.
Drivers and nondrivers alike, whether we want to or not: We pay and pay and pay for all those cars.
Nobody knows the totals as well as these two men, Ketcham and Komanoff.
Brian Ketcham, 53, is an old Lindsay administration hand, who these days has a transportation-consulting firm in Brooklyn. Komanoff, 45, is an economist who runs an energy-consulting firm in Manhattan. Under the auspices of the environmental group Transportation Alternatives, these two consultants have put together one prodigious piece of work.
In a 100-page, thoroughly researched treatise - and a shorter, easy-to-digest report - they have done something no serious social scientists have ever quite bothered to do. They've added up all the hidden social costs of automobiles.
Listen to these two guys for just a few minutes: You just might start riding a bike around town.
You might even begin appreciating the subway. * * *
The first thing Ketcham and Komanoff do is to show just how jaw-droppingly huge the government's subsidies to drivers are.
Start with $1.6 billion to build, maintain and administer roads in the New York metropolitan area. That's the easiest part of the public costs to comprehend.
But move on from there.
Another $2.9 billion in property damage and illness from car-caused air pollution. Another $2.5 billion to cover the government-paid costs of accidents. For the land wasted on "excessive" roadways: $2 billion. For the social problems caused by auto noise and vibrations: $1.6 billion. For the lost time due to congestion: $1.1 billion.
The list goes on (and on): Climate change, $300 million. Military expenditures to protect oil supply, $300 million.
These numbers are for New York City alone. Before you know it, they start adding up.
"This is equivalent to $3,000 taken forcibly and unawares out of the pockets of every man, woman and child in the New York metropolitan area," Ketcham and Komanoff write.
We're talking a total of $26 billion a year in these "hidden subsidies" - not including that $1.6-billion gift for roads.
A nice comparison: It'll just take another $266 million to keep the city bus-and-subway fare from rising to $1.50 on Jan. 1. * * *
Komanoff and Ketcham certainly have a political agenda here. They want to chip away at the "windshield perspective" that has dominated transportation planning for two generations in New York.
Their hope: That when people come to understand how much we're paying to keep those cars out on the road, we'll finally force the drivers to pay a bigger share. Perhaps we'll give more public dollars to the subways, buses and bikes, whose subsidies are really quite puny compared to the public dollars that go to cars.
"This inequity is particularly stark in New York City, where half of households do not own an automobile," Komanoff and Ketcham write. "The key is developing a political consensus to charge motorists for a fair share of the fiscal and social costs of driving."
There are various ways to shift this burden. Among them are gasoline taxes, bridge-and-tunnel tolls, special-user fees and registration tags.
But the funny thing is, if you look at it a certain way, even the drivers will gain.
"Far from being punitive to motorists, this approach will benefit motorists and non-motorists alike," Komanoff and Ketcham write. "In addition to improving existing roads, it will encourage some highway traffic to shift to alternatives such as subways, rail freight, carpooling, company vans, bicycling, walking and teleconferencing."
Who knows? The drivers might even like it.
Komanoff and Ketcham understand the going will be slow here. That's why they're recommending a 25-year phase-in.
But listen closely, now. At least the argument is about to begin.

Full text: With know-how and moxie, Jake Voogd built Evergreen Oil Inc. into a $15 million-a-year recycling business that could be a campaign advertisement for President Bush's market-based environmentalism - except for one thing.
Were it not for a California regulation of the sort championed by Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, Evergreen may never have gotten off the ground.
Evergreen's story is telling in a presidential campaign in which the environmental issue is framed chiefly in economic terms: Does regulation make or break jobs? The usual debate over pollution has been recast by the country's all-consuming financial difficulties. Instead of the cleanup of Boston Harbor in 1988, for example, the focus this year would be on the long-term economic impact of such a cleanup.
It was no coincidence that both camps visited Evergreen this summer to deliver very different messages. Bush, apparently unware of the importance of the state regulation to Evergreen, praised the company as a symbol of free enterprise in service of the environment. He criticized government intervention as a drag on business initiative.
Clinton's running mate, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), gave just the opposite pitch: Evergreen's success shows how regulation can benefit the economy by encouraging new technology and corporate efficiency.
The debate over regulation is important because the next president will have to deal with an environmental problem more deeply rooted in the economy and potentially more disruptive than any other in 20 years of pollution controls. The threat of global warming comes from the buildup of gases emitted by every car and factory in America.
Presidential hopefuls usually compete over ways to curb such pollutants. But Bush and Clinton are waging a more basic, philosophical duel over the costs of those controls. They often sound more like candidates for union boss fighting for the jobs of their local. Whether the issue is auto fuel-efficiency standards or protection of the northern spotted owl, they pepper their arguments with job statistics and economic projections.
To get perspective, however, it is possible to put their general approaches to the test in California, a longtime leader in environmental law whose 1986 regulation on the disposal of used oil is a handy reference point for the presidential debate.
In many ways the California legislative debate of six years ago mirrored the differences of today's candidates. Clinton supports regulations like this one to trigger technological change that helps the environment and, at the same time, creates jobs.
Bush's anti-regulatory position echoes the arguments of those who opposed California's regulation as a damper on profits and competitive advantage.
After five years of the state law, California has piled up enough practical experience to shed light on the larger clash of candidates. If their regulatory approaches are scored on the basis of what happened to jobs in a single industry of a single state, the Democrats win in a tight match.
The California experience bears out some of Bush's forebodings. Generators of used oil, such as service stations and factories, pay more today to dispose of their oil wastes. Companies that used to collect and resell it as fuel for industrial boilers have gone out of business or are squeezed by the high costs of pollution control, insurance and state fees.
Even Voogd gripes that the new red tape and permit rules have stymied his plans to build a Southern California plant with triple his current capacity.
But there were overall economic benefits of the regulation. Evergreen, for example, was able to refine its technology in a more conducive business climate and grow from a small tank farm to a company large enough to keep 70 percent of the cars and trucks in San Francisco running on recycled motor oil.
Layoffs from companies unable to meet the new standards were more than offset by the 100 jobs created at Evergreen and 98 by Gibson Environmental Inc., which converted a failing refinery into a $22 million-a-year business removing oil from contaminated soil and water. For each new job in the oil industry, economists estimate that another six are created in associated work.
The new businesses boosted tax revenue for the state, and Evergreen's marketing of its know-how overseas at $1.5 million a deal helps the nation's balance of payments.
Moreover, the environmental payoff for which the regulation was devised is bigger than expected. Nearly twice as much used oil was collected and removed as was predicted in the first three years of the law.
"I haven't seen any significant damage to the job market, and it definitely has had a good effect environmentally," said Leif Peterson, the state's hazardous materials specialist. "Less used oil is being burned and dumped into the environment."
For Voogd, a longtime Republican resident of conservative Orange County, where the term "regs" is considered a four-letter word, the 1986 regulation was "very important."
"It allowed our small plant, which was on the learning curve, to survive," he said. A National Problem
Used oil may be a serious environmental hazard, but it is by no means one of the burning national issues of the day. For purposes of critiquing the philosophical leanings of Bush and Clinton, it is simply a symbol.
Nevertheless, waste oil is a national problem that needs remedying, and one on which the candidates have spoken. Gore, a "green" leader of the Senate, wants more stringent controls nationally. Bush doesn't - he or his appointees have twice rejected plans to extend California-like standards nationally.
About 1.4 billion gallons of used oil are drained every year from auto crankcases and industrial motors nationwide. As a lubricant, the oil gets contaminated by toxic metals from engine wear and fuel. It has to be changed regularly to remain effective.
Most dirty oil, generated by car dealers, repair shops and truck depots, is collected by "reprocessors." They remove large particles and resell it as fuel for ships and industrial boilers, which emit more lead than any other industrial process - 600,000 pounds last year, according to the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council.
Low exposure to lead can impair the mental and physical growth of children and cause hypertension in adults.
More than a third of the nation's waste oil is dumped into sewers, storm drains or fields where it threatens to seep into groundwater. Only 5 percent is stripped of contaminants and recyled into motor oil by Evergreen and one other U.S. plant.
At Evergreen Aug. 2, Gore called for national limits on the lead byproducts of waste oil and charged that Bush was propagating a "false message that there has to be a choice between jobs and the environment."
Noting earlier that day that foreign rivals realize the huge market in "products and processes that make it possible to have economic progress and a higher standard of living without destroying the environment," he asked: "Why are Bush and {Vice President} Quayle saying that Japan and Germany are wrong?"
Bush's involvement with used oil dates back to 1981 when as vice president he headed a deregulatory task force that stopped a plan by the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate used oil as a hazardous waste, similar to California law.
Under court order to reconsider the regulation, the EPA ruled again in August - this time on Bush's watch. The decision declined to regulate used oil, but issued "management standards" widely regarded as too weak to prevent pollution.
The decision came amid a larger White House regulations moratorium that Bush imposed last year in the hope of stimulating the economy.
Speaking at Evergreen June 18, Bush gave his rationale: "I believe less regulation means more jobs. I have an obligation to guarantee health as best one can. But we can overdo it by frivolous regulations. And sometimes . . . in the environmental area we can get too regulatory." Public Health Argument
The California fight to regulate oil was led by environmental and Evergreen lobbyists who argued for strict limits on the lead content of reprocessed industrial fuels. They argued on public health grounds.
But only Evergreen, then being developed, would have had the technology to remove lead from waste oil.
Reprocessors countered that a tough lead standard would kill their industry and that Evergreen was too small to recycle the state's huge flow of used oil, 10 percent of the nation's total. Generators of waste oil would have no choice but to dump their waste.
Lawmakers passed a compromise: Used oil resold as industrial fuel could not exceed 100 parts per million (ppm) of lead, to be halved after two years. Average lead levels then were 1,000 ppm, Peterson said.
The law designated used oil as a hazardous waste and required a permit for anyone seeking to burn or dispose of it on land or in state waters.
By the time the law went into effect, Voogd was trying to get the bugs out of Evergreen, the nation's first state-of-the-art "re-refiner" able to remove pollutants from used oil and produce a premium grade lubricant.
Luckily for Voogd, the new regulation changed the economics of used oil. Previously, reprocessors paid gas stations and other generators up to 10 cents a gallon to haul their waste. They could resell it as industrial fuel for four times as much.
But once used oil was designated as "hazardous," the tables turned. Generators, held liable by federal law for environmental damage caused by such hazardous waste, became more interested in getting rid of the oil than selling it.
So Voogd started to charge for the pickup of used oil, starting at a nickle a gallon. As the only California facility fully licensed to handle the waste, the plant was especially attractive to large industrial generators eager to avoid long-term liability.
The fees allowed Voogd to meet his costs while Evergreen was ironing out technical problems. "If we had to pay for the oil, we would've gone bankrupt," he said in an interview. But it raised the costs of doing business for those who used to sell used oil but now had to pay to have it hauled away.
Now Evergreen collects 15 million gallons a year from 6,000 customers and charges 20 cents a gallon. More than 7 million gallons is re-refined into base oil, the primary ingredient of hydraulic and motor oils that sells for $1 per gallon. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E) buys Voogd's oil for much of its fleet.
Evergreen workers average salaries of $37,000 a year. The firm's economic impact extends beyond the plant gate to equipment vendors, cleanup and repair crews and distributors like the San Jose man who blends additives into base oil for the PG&E account.
Although the regulation was indifferently enforced at first, it imposed such high standards and costs that "gypsy" collectors who owned a truck or two to collect waste oil had no choice but to get out of business or sell out. Voogd bought eight small companies, steadying the supply of oil, or "feedstock," for Evergreen.
For larger reprocessors, the price of survival includes lab fees to certify that their product meets standards; $2 million in insurance coverage for losses from accidental spills; a hazardous waste facility tax of $64,000 a year; worker training costs, and engineering and legal fees.
The lead limit poses technical problems for reprocessors. They have to blend used oil with enough low-lead diesel to dilute the metal content. But that further raises costs.
California's oldest reprocessor, Leach Oil, was driven into bankruptcy. John Shubin, owner of Industrial Service Oil Co., lost his bank credit line and is planning to broker crude oil to overcome what he calls "too much regulatory overkill."
"I knew when this law passed, it was going to drive companies out of business," said Rick McAuley, president of Petroleum Recycling Corp. (PRC).
But it also eliminated competition for the fitter firms, like PRC, the state's largest oil reprocessor. Gobbling up smaller companies and expanding his service territory, McAuley increased his work force from 30 in the early 1980s to 150 today.
The 17 cents he now charges for each gallon of used oil helps to increase his gross profit margin by a dime for each gallon that PRC resells as fuel for industrial boilers and marine vessels.
"We didn't know we were going to be as successful as we were," he said at his office south of Los Angeles. Cost of Controls
Few question the overall value of the California law. But whether it is representative of the huge body of regulations is subject to debate. Industry spends $130 billion a year to implement government controls for everything from cars to hunting.
The consensus in one industry of California is that regardless of its merit, regulation is a force for change.
"There's a concentration of businesses, one or two lead companies and a bunch of also-rans," said McAuley of PRC. "The price to society is in the higher costs of services."
Evergreen has turned Voogd into at least a limited believer in regulation.
"The government should work with business to promote good opportunities while cleaning up the environment," he said. "There are those things costly to a taxpayer and those things that can be done at a profit."

Abstract: When it comes to recycling, Porsche is a unique and certainly esoteric case. Since nobody ever scraps a Porsche, there would appear to be little incentive to make them as recyclable as a mass-market product. The company's Dr Dusan Gruden recently pointed out, that of the 900,000 Porsche sportscars built since 1948, more than 600,000 are still in use. Even so, Porsche claims to be treading the pathway towards easier recyclability. Currently, Europe's scrap cars contribute around three million tons per year to refuse dumps. If their lifespan could be extended from ten to 12 years, says Gruden, this could be reduced by 17 per cent. As long ago as 1974, Porsche pointed out the importance of extended vehicle life-spans as a way of protecting the earth's resources. There is a catch. In order to reduce the sulphur dioxide emissions of diesel, which are greater than petrol, EC legislation is calling for its progressive "desulphurisation". Cleaner diesel will in fact hit the forecourts in January next year - and there could be an additional desulphurisation standard in 1995/1996. But, the additional energy required for this desulphurisation entails a considerable increase in carbon dioxide emissions from the refinery. For every tonne of sulphur retained in the refinery, some 21.5 tonnes of additional C02 are emitted.

Full text: As the heady days of the late eighties are succeeded by the lacklustre nineties, Europe's car-makers are increasingly conscious of the murky environmental waters sloshing around their wheels.
The Germans made most of the early running, prompted by a government which suggested the industry cleaned-up its act voluntarily rather than being forced by legislation. So, the buzz-word became "recycling", with most of the major manufacturers clamouring to show that even if they couldn't yet conjure a silk purse out of a sow's ear, they could at least make boot-linings out of all the old dashboards.
The problem of disposing of the 12 million wrecks that Western European motorists scrap each year is a formidable one. In Germany alone, some two million cars are disposed of annually, most in land-fill sites, others just surreptitiously dumped. With its present car population of three million and with an average car lifespan of ten years, by the turn of the century, Germany will have three million scrap cars each year.
The pattern set by the Germans is starting to form in the UK too - mainly instigated by importers of German products. For example, BMW opens its first UK-based recycling plant in the UK this month, and plans nine more by 1994. Its dealers are also part of a programme to recycle waste oil and other polluting by-products of the motor trade.
Volkswagen is initiating a waste disposal programme for its dealers here and has announced it will take back old Series Three Golfs and Ventos for recycling at the end of their useful lives. It is also changing the way it makes cars so that they can be scientifically taken apart when they reach the end of the road, their components re-used, recycled and re-made into new cars.
The most likely scenario, certainly in Germany, is that eventually, licenced salvage firms will be established which, on receiving a scrap car, will endorse the last owner's documents so that there is no longer a requirement to pay tax or insurance on the vehicle.
So far, BMW, PSA Group (Peugeot-Citroen) and Volkswagen, have set up pilot recycling projects, to determine ways of making cars that are more easily taken apart and their components more readily recyclable. Most recently, Rover Group announced plans to set up a joint-venture car recycling facility with materials reclamation specialists, Bird Group.
At these plants, scrap cars are systematically drained of waste fluids, dismantled and all materials separated into individual storage areas. The objectives are either to recondition components or re-use materials to recycle them chemically or mechanically, or to use them as a source of energy.
About 75 per cent of the average car consists of steel, which is relatively easy to recycle after it has been separated from the other materials and fluids it consists of. The most effective way is to feed the scrap shell into a crusher - or "shredder" - which pulverises it into re-usable walnut-sized pellets.
After removal, old plastic bumpers can be granulated then re-made into new components. Although the use of plastic in the construction of cars is on the increase - because of its weight-saving properties - the number of different types of plastics is being reduced, to ease eventual sorting and recycling. For the same reason, plastic components are being stamped with codes to show the specific type of material they are made from.
When it comes to recycling, Porsche is a unique and certainly esoteric case. Since nobody ever scraps a Porsche, there would appear to be little incentive to make them as recyclable as a mass-market product. The company's Dr Dusan Gruden recently pointed out, that of the 900,000 Porsche sportscars built since 1948, more than 600,000 are still in use. Even so, Porsche claims to be treading the pathway towards easier recyclability.
Currently, Europe's scrap cars contribute around three million tons per year to refuse dumps. If their lifespan could be extended from ten to 12 years, says Gruden, this could be reduced by 17 per cent. As long ago as 1974, Porsche pointed out the importance of extended vehicle life-spans as a way of protecting the earth's resources.
"Our study on the theme of the 'long-life automobile' was a logical sequence of the Porsche development and production philosophy," he says. "Although the vehicle was never built, many considerations from this development flowed into Porsche production cars." The company's hot-dip, galvanised body and ten-year warranty against rust perforation stem from this development.
Porsches are expensive, low-volume specialist cars, but a mass-market "long-life automobile' could be good news for the environment - and perhaps, the customer. But it could have decidedly worrying shortcomings from the motor trade and industry's long-term viewpoint . . .
The other area concerning environmentalists is vehicle emissions. In Europe, there is a growing move towards cutting consumption of fossil fuels and thus the generation of "greenhouse gas" carbon dioxide, but the Americans seem solely concerned with "localised" pollution problems. Here, diesel finds increasing favour with environmentalists.
But there is a catch. In order to reduce the sulphur dioxide emissions of diesel, which are greater than petrol, EC legislation is calling for its progressive "desulphurisation". Cleaner diesel will in fact hit the forecourts in January next year - and there could be an additional desulphurisation standard in 1995/1996. But, the additional energy required for this desulphurisation entails a considerable increase in carbon dioxide emissions from the refinery. For every tonne of sulphur retained in the refinery, some 21.5 tonnes of additional C02 are emitted.
It comes down to which problem you want to address most. Is it to be "local' air pollution and acidification, or global warming and climate-change? In the end, it is the womb-to-tomb, crude-oil to tailpipe life-cycle that matters.

Full text: CAMPAIGN '92;ELECTION '92
The script for Murphy Brown's season opener Monday remains TV's hottest secret, but Vice President Quayle is ready to ``blast'' back with a response.
Quayle spokesman David Beckwith confirmed Thursday an upcoming TV Guide report that Quayle's office received two advance copies of Monday night's script from ``someone in Hollywood.''
``The script we saw shows Hollywood twisting the vice president's words - as usual - into something he never said,'' Beckwith says. ``That's why he wants to respond, to correct what the show is saying.''
Details of the script remain unavailable, although some versions have been leaked. Executive producer Gary Dontzig says the show, starring Candice Bergen, is ``not an attack.''
Adds executive producer Steven Peterman: ``Part of this whole phenomena was that once the Republican staffers got a hold of this material, I think they became more worried by the way we handled it. They were hoping we'd be vicious and shoot ourselves in the foot.''
Beckwith tells the Sept. 26 TV Guide, ``If this is the correct script, then it's a real shot at the vice president and it's unfair.'' But he adds one kudo: ``Our original point was that Murphy Brown glamorized single motherhood. The script we saw makes a big deal out of de-glamorizing single motherhood, showing how tough it is. This is enormous progress.'' Needless to say, stay tuned.
DRAFT ISSUE LINGERS: Bill Clinton spent another day Thursday deflecting questions about the draft, this time refusing to respond to new charges by a retired Arkansas ROTC leader. Col. Eugene Holmes, who headed the University of Arkansas ROTC program in 1969, says he believed Clinton ``deceived'' him in order to avoid being drafted. The affidavit by Holmes, who has previously questioned Clinton's statements on the draft, seemed to contradict Holmes' own statements back in 1978, when he praised Clinton.
But in his new statement, Holmes said Clinton didn't tell him he opposed the Vietnam War and had already received a draft notice when he applied in 1969 for an ROTC slot.
Dee Dee Myers, Clinton press secretary, asked: ``What's new about it? What's to say about it? This guy has changed his story. It's curious that 23 years after the fact and 48 days before the election, he's changing his story.''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Holmes statement ``goes to the heart of why Bill Clinton should not be president. He was deceitful and he still cannot tell America the facts.'' He labeled Clinton ``Mr. Doublespeak.''
BUSH ATTACK: With attention focused on chaos in European money markets, President Bush linked Bill Clinton's economic ideas to European-style socialism. Speaking in Enid, Okla., Bush warned a crowd of about 2,000 supporters that the Oxford-educated Clinton was influenced by the social democracy and communism that has dominated Europe since World War II.
``Those old social engineers advocated large-scale government ownership to give the state the leading role in the society and economy ... to create a welfare state,'' Bush said. ``I stand with the private sector, the risk taker.''
Bush later traveled to Atlanta, where he announced a plan to roll back regulations in order to cut the cost of insurance on 15-year mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration. Housing Secretary Jack Kemp estimates the change will reduce mortgage insurance premiums by an average of $650.
IN BRIEF: Economist Arthur Laffer, the founding father of Reaganomics, said Bush's economic performance has been a disaster and said he would vote for Clinton. ... A group of Little Rock police officers endorsed President Bush as Republican party official Samuel Skinner said in Arkansas that ``governors like'' Clinton are to blame for increases in the nation's crime rate.

Full text: COMMENT;RIO;John Shanahan says the president stood firm for principles that protect both the environment and jobs.;John Shanahan is environmental policy analyst for the Heritage Foundation.
Well, the Earth Summit is over.
Throughout the conference, the American press criticized the Bush administration's positions.
Scandal erupted when a classified memo from U.S. delegation head William Reilly to the White House was leaked to the press.
Germany attempted to undermine the United States by revisiting the terms of the painfully negotiated Global Climate Accord.
Environmental activists characterized the USA as the ``evil empire'' for refusing to provide enormous sums of money to Third World governments without restrictions on its use.
Meanwhile, the president told the world that the U.S. environmental record is ``second to none.''
The important question is: What have we learned from the hoopla and rhetoric of the last two weeks?
In reflection, there are two lessons.
First, the president was right to insist that we study climate change further before mandating drastic measures to curb greenhouse gases, especially since such measures could throw hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work.
More important, most climate-change researchers dispute the theory of catastrophic global warming. Proponents base their predictions on computer models that are fatally flawed. In fact, one model predicted warming by effectively moving the Earth's orbit 2 million miles closer to the sun.
While models predict that global warming already should have occurred, the Earth's average temperature is the same as during World War II, before most man-made gases were produced.
Ironically, the temperature actually dipped from 1945 to 1975, provoking hysterical warnings of an inevitable ice age.
Although the risk of global warming is minimal, the USA is intelligently buying insurance against its occurrence. We will spend $1.4 billion on global climate-change research - more than all other countries combined.
Other countries have talked a good game but have been unwilling to invest in meaningful research.
The second lesson is that this summit was not about the environment. It was about money.
Discussions focused on transfer payments from the Northern developed countries to the governments of the Southern developing countries.
At first glance, the South's demands seem quite reasonable. As one Southern delegate stated, ``You want us {to stop cutting} our trees so you can drive your cars.''
The South fears that its development will be limited, so it demands wealth transfers of $125 billion annually. But without use restrictions.
The North, however, led by the USA, insists on some control over how any transfer payments are used.
The USA is legitimately concerned that finances might not be used for environmental protection. Deterioration in the South often has been caused by the governments themselves. Also, many developing countries are ruled by dictators with a history of lining their own pockets.
In the final analysis, President Bush gets high marks for his positions at the summit. He braved the jeers of the press and the thunderous applause for Fidel Castro, communist dictator of pollution-ravaged Cuba. The president stood firm in support of principles that protect both the environment and jobs, reaffirming that our nation is ``second to none.''

The road from Rio: Bush maneuvering for a carbon tax: [City Edition]

Abstract: Certainly the fact that he didn't surrender to the sentimental chorus of good intentions that rose in Rio has made him a symbol of tough-minded resistance to the latest international fad.

Feldstein served as chief adviser to Bush in the 1988 campaign, then propelled his associates, including chief economic adviser Michael Boskin, into key jobs after the election. It is an almost certain thing that Feldstein was speaking of matters that are on the president's mind. Somewhat less well known, in the United States at least, is the swivet into which the carbon tax threw the European Community in May, in the days before the Rio meeting.

This was no mere recommendation; it constituted draft legislation for the 12 member nations. The politicians who run the EC prepared to go to Rio to set the whole world an example, by levying a tax on Europe so long as the United States and Japan followed suit.

Full text:   Economic Principals / DAVID WARSH
Poor George Bush. He's really been taking it from the commentators down in Rio. The conventional wisdom is that his performance range was either downright wicked, intransigent or inept. For example, Sen. Al Gore, leader of the US congressional delegation, says "the White House gave the impression of a Keystone Kops-type operation." The same president who did such a good job in rallying support for the Persian Gulf War, the critics marvel, has been such a failure in building consensus on the environment.
In fact, Bush probably has charted what is more or less the proper course -- again.
Certainly the fact that he didn't surrender to the sentimental chorus of good intentions that rose in Rio has made him a symbol of tough-minded resistance to the latest international fad. It was Fidel Castro who received the lusty ovation from the gathered throng, after all; Bush collected the boos. Quite aside from the slogans -- he was defending American jobs, he was defending American sovereignty -- it was just plain caution and good sense that Bush displayed, and it will probably do him much more good than harm in the November election.
What hasn't been noted is that, behind the scenes, his administration has been quietly laying the basis for a concrete deal on global greenhouse gas emissions. With a little luck, it will lead within a year or two to serious international controls.
How so? Well, at the height of the highly public shadow-play in Brazil, the Harvard economist Martin Feldstein called for the adoption of a world carbon tax. "The idea of a carbon tax levied by all of the major industrial countries may not be on the current agenda," Feldstein wrote in an article published on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, "but it could turn out to be the most important result of the Earth Summit."
No economic adviser is more closely associated with President Bush than Professor Feldstein, who is best remembered for his falling-out in 1983 with President Reagan over the significance of the exploding deficit. Feldstein served as chief adviser to Bush in the 1988 campaign, then propelled his associates, including chief economic adviser Michael Boskin, into key jobs after the election. It is an almost certain thing that Feldstein was speaking of matters that are on the president's mind.
A carbon tax, were it uniformly levied by the industrial nations, would be the financial engine of a system of tradeable carbon dioxide emission permits, designed to keep global emissions at, say, 1990 levels by whatever methods cost the least. Nations that wanted to emit more greenhouse gases would pay those that emitted less; rich countries would pay poor countries to clean up the Earth.
Such a market-based system would consitute the relatively low-cost "insurance" against the more troubling possibilities of a warmer Earth that the most senior boards of specialists in the last few years have recommended buying. Such a tax would hit oil and gas producers hardest, though it would hardly put most of them out of business; households would scarcely notice it at all. A study in the new Brookings Papers on Economic Activity estimates that such a tax would cost the US economy barely half a percent of gross domestic product over the next 20 years.
A little background: It is well known how, in the days during which the agenda for the Rio meeting was being prepared, the United States persuaded the other industrial nations to abandon a showy agreement that would have been the greenhouse-gas equivalent of a balanced-budget amendment -- a treaty requiring them to stabilize the emission of greenhouse gases at 1990 levels within the next 10 years, without specifying any way of going about it. The United States held out for a treaty without targets, saying all the while that a carbon tax was the right first step.
Somewhat less well known, in the United States at least, is the swivet into which the carbon tax threw the European Community in May, in the days before the Rio meeting. First the EC's Executive Committee voted for a new tax on oil, gas and coal, starting at $3 a barrel and rising to $10 a barrel by century's end. This was no mere recommendation; it constituted draft legislation for the 12 member nations. The politicians who run the EC prepared to go to Rio to set the whole world an example, by levying a tax on Europe so long as the United States and Japan followed suit.
The EC's Executive Committee quickly found it couldn't make stick its bold initiative. Member nations were divided sharply on the measure, with Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark enthusiastically supporting it, and Spain, Portugal and Greece opposing it. The committee thereupon withdrew the measure -- and the EC's environmental commissioner stayed home from Rio to protest. The White House, which had argued to the Europeans that now was not a propitious moment to enact the tax, breathed a sigh of relied.
Welcome to the politics of the New World Order! As economist Feldstein notes, the European commissioners should have understood that no European parliament could enact such a major tax without an extensive national debate; once again, the bureaucrats got out ahead of the politicians. But if the difficulty of passing such a measure was great in Europe, it could only be greater in the United States, where the battle cry "no new taxes" evokes passions that run almost as high as the conviction that something should be done about greenhouse emissions.
It should have been obvious, Feldstein wrote, that "the US could contemplate such a massive tax increase only in the context of a general budget agreement and therefore that it could not be considered until after the election." Now this is really quite an interesting glimpse of the thinking apparently going on at high levels in the Bush administration, even if it does come from a man without official portfolio. It gives considerable insight into the the pressures on the president in this three-way election year: a measure to help balance the US budget and save the planet cannot be mentioned by the president in an election year, because of pressure from his right wing.
Nevertheless, behind the scenes, the administration team is systematically going after the carbon tax. EPA chief William Reilly was baiting America's G-7 allies last week in Rio, telling them that the United States wants a "prompt start" on a climate change convention. Such a meeting would, in effect, be the beginning of a new international regulatory agency, whose work would be to contemplate the emission monitoring, the distribution of emission rights and tax negotiating that is a necessary prelude to beginning the great atmospheric cleanup.
In the end, the international environmental regulatory apparatus will resemble nothing so much as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- the bare-bones, little-understood Geneva-based agency that for 40 years has overseen world trade. The Bush administration is actively putting it together. The president isn't getting much credit for it in most of the simple-minded analysis that has been emanating from Rio, though. That is just another aspect of the greatly increased complexity of politics in the early days of the New World Order.

Abstract: The Earth Summit is about presidential politics and microwave ovens. It's about rich nations and impoverished nations. It's about landfills, nuclear power, oil, wind energy, solar power, coal, natural gas, spotted owls, electric cars, miles per gallon, rising seas and declining rain forests. A U.N. study, which is the foundation for the Earth Summit, warned that without cutting such greenhouse gases as carbon dioxide and methane, the global mean surface temperature will rise by 0.4 to 0.9 degrees each decade, reaching a total of 4.5 degrees by the end of the 21st century. The Earth Summit is much more than a discussion of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. It also addresses the relationship between developed and developing countries in the aftermath of the Cold War.

WASHINGTON - Trying to define this week's Earth Summit is like trying to define, well, the Earth.
More than 20,000 people, including at least 100 national leaders, will converge on Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, beginning Wednesday, and nearly every one of them will have a different idea of how to save the Earth from global climate change.
Out of it is expected to come a treaty that will pledge the industrialized countries to limiting emissions of what are known as greenhouse gases.
And they will promise to help developing countries with technology and money to help them improve their economies without adding to the pollutants that are believed to be warming the Earth's atmosphere.
But from there, the sky's the limit.
The Earth Summit is about presidential politics and microwave ovens. It's about rich nations and impoverished nations. It's about landfills, nuclear power, oil, wind energy, solar power, coal, natural gas, spotted owls, electric cars, miles per gallon, rising seas and declining rain forests.
It's about jobs, jobs, jobs. American jobs, Nigerian jobs, Australian jobs, atmospheric scientists' jobs and politicians' jobs.
The summit is based on the supposition that mankind's pollution is altering the Earth's atmosphere in such a way that more and more heat from the sun will be trapped near the Earth. Temperatures will rise.
This is known as the greenhouse effect.
From there the argument goes all over the map and becomes bitter as scientists question one another's motives, as environmentalists battle industry groups and as politicians angle for the high ground.
A U.N. study, which is the foundation for the Earth Summit, warned that without cutting such greenhouse gases as carbon dioxide and methane, the global mean surface temperature will rise by 0.4 to 0.9 degrees each decade, reaching a total of 4.5 degrees by the end of the 21st century.
The World Resources Institute warns that along with inundating part of the coastline, a significant temperature increase would make coastal storms more frequent and fierce, allow tropical diseases and parasites to move north, destroy the natural habitat for many species and turn fertile land into desert.
But a vocal minority of atmospheric scientists disagree with the United Nations' study and the World Resource Institute's predictions. They contend that the study is based on complex computer models of the atmosphere that cannot possibly contain all the factors that determine climate.
The problem, said Richard Grundy, a senior Republican staff member on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is that it will be "10 to 30 years before science can confirm what we are debating today."
That may be true, said Philip Barnett, a leading House Democratic environmental staff member, "but if we wait 10 years to do anything, we may have to have a crash program that would be more damaging to the economy than a reasoned program started now."
Spending money now to combat global warming, he said, would be like buying a homeowner's insurance policy for the world.
But the Earth Summit is as much about politics as science.
President Bush looked at the uncertainty among scientists and decided that he would not go to Rio unless provisions were removed from the treaty that set time- tables and reduction rates to eliminate greenhouse gases.
He agreed with business interests that said the treaty could undercut the U.S. economy if the United States had to cut power production.
Bush said he would agree to work toward the United Nations' goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, but he would not agree to having the country required to do so.
Even though all of the other industrialized countries had agreed to specific reduction, U.S. negotiators were able to get them removed from the treaty. Bush announced that he would go to Rio.
Democrats have been quick to castigate the president.
"It was thrilling to see the rest of the world come to the United States and ask us to lead," said Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo. "But instead of leading, the United States reached for the lowest common denominator in protection of the global climate."
How much combating global warming would cost the United States is even more uncertain than the science supporting the theory. Estimates range from its destroying the U.S. economy by pushing up the price of energy to helping the economy by promoting energy efficiency.
But the Earth Summit is much more than a discussion of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. It also addresses the relationship between developed and developing countries in the aftermath of the Cold War.
The developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America are seeing interest in their economic development disappear now that they are no longer factors in an East-West struggle.
They are demanding that if the developed countries want them to maintain their rain forests, which absorb carbon dioxide as well as provide opportunities for pharmaceutical discoveries, then investment must flow to them.
And they argue that an economy struggling at a subsistence level gives off more pollution than one that is thriving because it cannot invest in such niceties as pollution control.
As with so much else with the Earth Summit, how much that will cost developing countries is uncertain.
"We're still not at a stage of defining costs," said Jonathan Pershing, a State Department official working on the Rio treaty. "We're still in the stage of deciding how we are going to prepare reports to study the problem. We are not at the stage of implementing strategy."

Hafnia spurned Skandia's friendly offer of $504 million in a board-room rebellion, plunging Scandinavia's insurance scene into turmoil.
---
U.S. manufacturing continued to expand in April, but at a slower pace than the strong growth posted in February and March, a survey of purchasing managers indicated.
---
Hungary is the first of the former Warsaw Pact countries to be dropped from a list of countries subject to strict export controls by the U.S. and its allies.
---
Germany is expected to come under pressure from other EC members to back a measure limiting the EC work week even if this means overruling Britain.
---
Lloyds Bank promised to improve the service it offers small businesses, as it and HSBC Holdings stepped up their fight over Midland Bank.
---
Shell Oil's net rose 55% in the first quarter but operating profit plunged 96% as Shell struggled to climb out of a company and industry morass.
---
London share prices gained on Friday, helped partly by expectations of an imminent interest-rate cut by the Bank of England. The FT-SE 100 share index added 5.7 points to 2659.8.
Sterling bonds rallied as the Bank of England appeared to signal it wants lower money-market rates. The National and Provincial Building Society's #150 million issue of five year bonds rose about 0.20 point.
---
The U.S. has indicated a softening of its opposition to international efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions by the turn of the century. But it is unclear whether this shift can provide the basis for a treaty on climate change in time for the June Earth Summit in Rio.
---
Delft Instruments said its 1991 loss widened to $26.8 million because of sanctions for violating U.S. curbs on exports to Iraq shortly before the Persian Gulf war.
---
Krupp Stahl expects the current year to be difficult. The German steelmaker posted a 43% drop in 1991 operating profit as sales fell 1.7%.
---
Nintendo of America's apparently successful defense of an antitrust suit by Atari is as much a stinging rebuke for Atari, which called the ruling "outrageous," as a vindication for the Japanese-owned concern.
---
The dollar's course in the near term hinges on U.S. employment data due Friday. Traders and economists link the resumption of a rally in the U.S. currency partly to improvement in the weak labor market.
---
Tokyo's market is seen trading in a narrow range in a week shortened by a two-day holiday. Stocks were mixed Friday, with the index falling 87.32 points. But advancers led decliners. Hong Kong stocks may retreat following Friday's surge.

THE CLIMATE CLASH As debate over global-warming heats up, some things are known, but many are not Series: THE WARM WAR. Global Warming: Conflict Over Climate-Third in a Series: [NASSAU AND SUFFOLK Edition]

Author: By Robert Cooke. STAFF WRITER

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/climate-clash-as-debate-over-global-warming-heats/docview/278490392/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Whether the increase in carbon dioxide has started warming the world's climate, however, is still being debated, more than warmly. Climatologist James Hansen, for one, thinks warming has begun, and that it will be characterized in the 1990s by events such as droughts and floods. Hansen is director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. Climate specialists agree, generally, that global temperatures have risen by about half a degree in the past century. But, while some point to the increase as a sign of global warming, others note that it's less of an increase than predicted by the computerized global-warming scenarios. The increase is also well within the range of natural fluctuations; a half-degree of warming could be just a normal bump in the climate's ordinary ups and downs. Water vapor. It is known that water vapor is itself a potent Greenhouse Gas, and as more moisture gets pumped into the air, warming might be accentuated. But excess water vapor could also condense into clouds, increasing the planet's reflectivity, tending to cool the atmosphere. Oceans. Most of the planet's surface is covered with water, and the oceans are known to be huge "heat sink," a storage system for solar energy. It is not known how the oceans would change, or how rapidly they could change, in repsonse to global warming.

THE REAL AWAKENING began when scientists got their first good, closeup views of other planets. At Mars, for example, the Mariner 9 spacecraft dropped into orbit in 1971 just as a planetwide dust storm was building. Mars' red landscape was completely obscured for weeks until the dust gradually settled.
At Venus, other spacecraft found a greenhouse gone wild, a planet being cooked in its own atmosphere. So much heat is trapped in Venus' dense shroud of gas that everything volatile has been vaporized, creating a perfect picture of hell. Venus' surface temperature is about 900 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead. And the thick, sluggish atmosphere is loaded with sulfuric acid.
While exciting, the discoveries also raised alarm. They provide stark evidence that global extremes can occur, sometimes quickly, sometimes in awesome ways. The lessons, applied to Earth, suggest that earlier concerns about atmospheric changes are worth some worry.
Although it was known as early as 1896 that carbon dioxide, when added to air, traps extra heat, serious concern about the consequences hasn't been widespread until recently. As expanding industry has accelerated use of fossil fuels, the carbon dioxide in air has increased by 25 percent since the Industrial Revolution began. By the year 2050, it may be double what it was in 1860. The change may boost global temperatures anywhere from 2 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit.
Whether the increase in carbon dioxide has started warming the world's climate, however, is still being debated, more than warmly. Climatologist James Hansen, for one, thinks warming has begun, and that it will be characterized in the 1990s by events such as droughts and floods. Hansen is director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City.
Other scientists, such as meteorologist Richard Lindzen, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, disagree, arguing that global warming is not a sure thing. And most researchers think the subtle signs of warming have not become evident within the natural fluctuations of world climate and weather.
Knowns and Unknowns
There is no doubt, of course, that the greenhouse effect is real - and, so far, beneficial. It is greenhouse warming - but in moderate form - that makes the Earth habitable. The "natural" greenhouse effect caused by "normal" amounts of carbon dioxide raises the temperature enough, about 35 degrees (C) higher than it would be otherwise, to make the planet comfortable for life.
The main problem is that even though everyone agrees the air's chemical balance is being changed, no one can say accurately what, if anything, will happen. But there are signs - such as shrinking glaciers, bleached coral reefs, recent severe droughts in Africa and North America and a string of extra-warm summers during the 1980s - hinting that the climate may be warming because of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
Those who disagree argue that the string of hot summers was probably a natural fluctuation in continuing weather patterns, with little further impact. Glaciers have long been known to wax and wane. Droughts occur frequently. And a experts even suspect the earth may get cooler rather than warmer because of increased cloud cover and possibly more snowfall.
This wide range of predictions hints at how little is really known about an extraordinarily complex subject, global climate. Because of the atmosphere's extreme complexity, computer models trying to mimic world climate are handicapped by the assumptions they're based on, which suffer from a lack of critical data.
The influence of the oceans, for example, is generally unaccounted for in computer models. And cloudiness of the sky is only roughly accounted for, even though clouds play critical roles in the planet's energy budget.
In addition to carbon dioxide, of course, emissions of the other greenhouse gases have been accelerating as industry expands. These gases include methane (from natural gas and the intestines of cows, sheep and other grass-eating animals, plus termites), nitrous oxide, and the very stable industrial gases called CFCs.
All such factors increase the complexity of the problem, making it harder to create accurate, reliable climate models.
"My own feeling," said atmospheric scientist Ronald Prinn, is that the current climate models "are very uncertain, but I can't rule them out. I realize there are a lot of missing or poorly modeled processes" in the computer simulations. "But since I can't rule out the results being correct, I'm very concerned. I think it's too dangerous to sit and say let's wait until science has all the predictions nailed down.
"We can't wait. I don't think we can wait to move to quickly discussing all the possible ways to do something about rising {levels of} greenhouse gases," Prinn said. "Some of the results are worrisome. Some of the predictions you'd like to rule out, you can't rule out."
Defensive Options
Doing something about greenhouse gases, however, is both difficult and expensive. The most effective policy option - greatly reducing the use of fossil fuels - would hamper development in Third World nations and perhaps cause severe unemployment in the energy, automobile, aircraft and other fuel-dependent industries.
Other options include emphasizing energy conservation, cutting fewer trees and planting more trees. Trees, like all vegetation, absorb carbon dioxide. The use of CFCs is already being reduced, and may soon be phased out, but not to prevent global warming. These chemicals are the culprits thinning the stratospheric ozone that blocks out most of the sun's dangerous ultraviolet rays.
Prinn, recently named director of the new Center for Global Change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sees an urgent need for action. "In my mind," he said, "it's time for intensive study of all of these policy options, their costs, and also the costs of doing nothing. It is urgent that this be done with the science fully integrated into the policy-making process."
But, he added, "I would not like to see drastic policies put into place before the fully-integrated study is done."
Lindzen, also at MIT, argues that too little is known to start putting any policies in place. "Anytime you're ignorant, it only means you're ignorant," nothing else, he warned. The numbers in a computer are just that, he says, numbers that don't represent real climate with great accuracy. "And," Lindzen warned, "it could be very bad to legislate on the basis of ignorance."
Pressure to Act
Despite the obvious gaps in understanding of world climate, political pressure is mounting to do something soon about global warming. The Earth Summit conference scheduled for Rio de Janeiro in June, for example, is likely to increase demand to limit greenhouse gases, especially the 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide produced annually by human activities.
But Lindzen, for one, sees no clear need.
"As a scientist," he said, "I find no substantive basis for the warming scenarios being popularly described." And "since we don't see warming in the data, there really is no basis for the hysteria."
Even if warming does result, he said, the increase in temperature will probably be so small "there would be little difficulty adapting."
The real danger, he added, is that "once you commit yourself to a scenario" and try to meet its consequences, it's hard to change course, "even if the evidence is to the contrary."
Atmospheric scientist Michael McElroy, at Harvard University, agreed that "there are deficiencies in the {computer} models. There is no doubt about that. But I feel the question is whether they are good enough; is there any serious reason to suspect that adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere will not give us a warmer climate?"
Even without computer models, McElroy said, there is strong evidence that the Earth's climate has varied dramatically in the past, being so warm at one time that "alligators were swimming in Alaskan waters. That tells me that the philosophical view that climate is stable and resists change is not correct."
And, McElroy said, "since we are changing the composition of the atmosphere, and since we're making those changes occur very, very rapidly - like in a human lifetime - I think the onus on the policy side is to do what we can responsibly to slow down the pace of change."
Climate `Insurance'
Climatologist Stephen Schneider also thinks the danger of global warming is real - even if the data are incomplete. Because of what he sees as the ominous potential, Schneider advocates changing some human activities. Because of the climate uncertainties, he argues, the changes should be those that are needed anyway, to curb air pollution and acid rain, for instance.
This is often called the "no regrets" approach. Prinn also thinks it is wise, even though he thinks the label is wrong because such changes will cause some problems.
Schneider, at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in Boulder, Colo., explained in The Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society:
"It is obvious that the things to do first are the things that make the most economic and social sense, regardless of whether global warming materializes.
"Using energy efficiently will not only reduce the prospect of rapid climate change, but will also reduce acid rain, will reduce pollution in cities, will reduce the balance of payments deficit and, in the long run, can improve product competitiveness."
Schneider characterized such proposals - aimed at perhaps a 20-percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions - as climate insurance. Points of Agreement
Points of agreement do exist between supporters and critics of global-warming scenarios:
Global climate is highly variable, even without industrial gases being released into the air. Ice ages - the growth and decline of glacial ice - for example, occur regularly.
The air is changing. Since industrial activity began in earnest, the amount of carbon dioxide in air has gone up, from 280 parts per million in the 1800s to 355 parts per million now. At the present rate of release, and with expected industrial expansion, the amount of carbon dioxide in air may double from the 19th Century figure, reaching 560 parts per million, by the year 2050, modelers estimate.
What remains unclear, however, is how some other factors, such as atmospheric circulation, the oceans as a "heat sink," the polar ice caps, evaporation of water, dust in the air, volcanic eruptions, and cloud formation complicate the picture.
Climate specialists agree, generally, that global temperatures have risen by about half a degree in the past century. But, while some point to the increase as a sign of global warming, others note that it's less of an increase than predicted by the computerized global-warming scenarios. The increase is also well within the range of natural fluctuations; a half-degree of warming could be just a normal bump in the climate's ordinary ups and downs.
At present, Schneider added, an international group of scientists projects "a further warming, from a moderate 0.5 degrees (C) up to a potentially catastrophic 5 degrees (C), or greater, before the end of the next century." Possible Consequences
Schneider noted that several lines of evidence - including ice cores extracted from deep within the thick glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica, indicate that even a few degrees' change in average temperature might be important. "The Earth has not been more than one to two degrees {C} warmer during the 10,000-year era of human civilization," he noted. Also, he wrote in a recent issue of Monitor, a monthly publication of the Christian Science church, that "the previous ice age - in which mile-high ice sheets stretched from New York to Chicago - was only 5 degrees (C) colder than now."
Thus it seems likely that an increase of 5 degrees, if it occurs, could have strong global impact, Schneider said.
"Changes of this magnitude could dramatically alter accustomed climatic patterns, affecting agriculture, water supplies, disease patterns, ecosystems, endangered species, severe storms, sea level and coastal flooding," he noted.
He also explained in the Meteorological Society's bulletin that a 5-degree increase "is the magnitude of global warming that occurred between 15,000 and 5,000 years ago - the end of the last ice age to our present inter-glacial epoch."
One important difference between then and now, however, is that the large natural temperature changes apparently took a long time to occur, something like 5,000 to 10,000 years. Any warming induced by human activities will probably come on much faster, perhaps in 100 years. Species that need time to adapt - tree species gradually shifting northward, for example - might find their comfortable habitat moving north, without the ability to follow.
Most of the crops that humans rely on, however, could be gradually moved to more suitable regions, scientists say. Farmers routinely rotate different crops onto the same land, even to improve the soil, new crops are bred constantly and seeds are easily transported around the world.
Moving tree crops - such as fruit and nut orchards - would be more difficult, obviously, but could still be done in a few years' time
Lindzen, in discussing reasons to view climate-warming scenarios with skepticism, explained why:
All of the complex, computer-based climate models disagree with each other, further underlining the uncertainties.
Recent measurements of the sun's brightness taken by satellites show that the amount of energy delivered to the Earth varies slightly, in step with the sun's 22-year sunspot cycle. Such fluctuations could account for changes seen in global temperature.
Carbon dioxide is not accumulating in the air as rapidly as computer models have predicted. This suggests that a sink - something down which the gas disappears - exists somewhere. One possibility is that living things consume more carbon dioxide than expected.
The carbon dioxide picture is also complicated by the fact that increased amounts of the gas can cause plant growth to accelerate, increasing the demand for carbon dioxide, pulling more from the air.
The greenery is especially important because trees, along with phyto-plankton in the sea, absorb tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide, using the carbon to build tissues in the sun-powered process called photosynthesis. As trees are cut down and the land is turned to agriculture or left barren, a major "sponge" capable of soaking up excess carbon dioxide disappears.
Expected changes in sea level are far from certain. Now it seems that sea level will probably not rise as dramatically as once predicted; coastal cities might be spared from flooding. Lindzen said there is general agreement now that the water will rise only an inch or two - not tens of feet - "even if we get all of the warming" predicted by various models.
In fact, how the oceans might react to global warming may be the biggest joker in the deck. It is thought that the seas' reaction to global change will be lethargic, since it takes about 500 years for a given amount of water to complete a trip around the globe in the deep and powerful ocean currents.
But geologist Wallace Broecker, at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Geophysical Observatory, suspects the oceans can react faster than generally expected. The huge ocean conveyor system - which starts with cold, dense, salty water sinking toward the seafloor near Iceland - is what brings warm surface water back to the North Atlantic. Heat released from northward-flowing water is what gives northern Europe its relatively benign climate.
According to Broecker, there is evidence that this huge ocean circulation system can switch abruptly to a different pattern, causing significant climatic changes.
No Winning Argument
According to Broecker, at Columbia, neither side in the argument over global warming has firm enough evidence to present a winnable case.
"If the reality of global warming were put on trial," Broecker wrote recently in Natural History magazine, "each side would have trouble making its case."
The case that Broecker makes is that an expanding human population is the real problem. As population grows, and as demand for fossil fuels grows in step, "annual emissions of greenhouse gases are likely to increase," he said.
So, he added, "I hope the concern about global warming will force us to develop a broader perspective on our planet's future - one that will include the reality of the population bomb." **** Climatic Puzzle: The Odd Pieces
Some major uncertainties remain in the effort to sort out how the climate will respond to rapid increases in carbon dioxide and other Greenhouse Gases:
Cloud dynamics. It is still not known what clouds will do in response to warming. As more water evaporates into the air, cloud cover may increase, blocking sunlight, causing cooling. If clouds form at the correct altitude, however, they tend to block radiation of heat away from the Earth, causing further warming. Or, the two effects may balance, causing no change.
Water vapor. It is known that water vapor is itself a potent Greenhouse Gas, and as more moisture gets pumped into the air, warming might be accentuated. But excess water vapor could also condense into clouds, increasing the planet's reflectivity, tending to cool the atmosphere. Oceans. Most of the planet's surface is covered with water, and the oceans are known to be huge "heat sink," a storage system for solar energy. It is not known how the oceans would change, or how rapidly they could change, in repsonse to global warming.
Sun. Firm evidence has been found showing that the sun's energy output - its luminosity - varies slightly along with the sun's 22-year sunspot cycle. It is also known that long-term, gradual variations in the Earth's distance from the sun alter the amount of energy the planet receives. Such orbital changes are linked to the growth and decline of glacial ice - ice ages.
Particles. Dust, sea salt and other airborne particles act as nuclei on which ice and water collect, forming cloud droplets. The amount of particles in the air can influence how long clouds persist, how long they hold the moisture that condenses to form rain.

Full text: WHEN I HOLD my youngest granddaughter, I touch a future I won't see. When she's my age, the 21st century will be over half gone. Decisions on global warming made today - or not made - touch her world as surely as my arms touch her.
"To anticipate global changes and act in advance, before a potential crisis develops." That's the challenge, Harvard and M.I.T. professors Eugene Skolnikoff and Abram Chayes told 300 U.N. delegates struggling for consensus last week.
The trouble is, said astronomer Carl Sagan, we respond better when the crisis is actual, not potential. It's hard to raise public concern about "invisible gases . . . when the damage happens in the time of our children and our grandchildren."
People don't plan that far ahead. Politicians calculate beyond the next election as easily as corporate planners look beyond their company's bottom line.
As for scientists, Union of Concerned Scientists chairman Henry Kendall told the U.N. delegates "we scientists are cautious by nature, hesitant to sound the alarm until we are confident of our findings."
Yes, he said, there is "broad" scientific consensus on the "likely" range and consequence of global warming. For 150 years, human-caused gas emissions (particularly carbon dioxide from the burning of gasoline, oil and coal) have cumulatively skewed the delicately balanced envelope of air that filters sunlight to the Earth.
Unchecked, the planet's expected to warm 0.3 degrees every decade. The problem's not so much the warming, but the unprecedented rate which leaves the startled Earth no time to adapt.
Possible effects on my granddaughter's world include seas rising 30 to 100 centimetres (warmed water takes more space), uprooted peoples, flooded croplands, prairie deserts, dried tundra, and the tearing of eco-systems on which the web of life depends.
But the breakneck rate of climate change for Earth (confirmed by analysis of eons-old air bubbles in Arctic ice-cores) seems gradual to us.
More than once at the U.N. last week, we were told a frog, dropped in boiling water, will leap out if it can; left in a slowly heating pot, it waits quietly until its boiling death.
There were voices that counselled quiet waiting. A few scientists (like those who once spoke for tobacco companies) were assembled by an industrial consortium including the Canadian Coal Association and Saudi Arabian oil exporters. Referring to "substantial scientific uncertainties," they said, "we don't share the assumption that global warming is a proven immediate threat."
The cautious U.N. scientists themselves refuse to draw straight line connections between gas emissions and currently warming temperatures (1990 and 1991 recorded the highest averages in 6,000 years) and rising seas (four islands in the low-lying Maldives have already been evacuated). Unequivocal proof, they say, won't come for 10 years. ("Waiting for the proof will kill us," a Maldivian said.)
"Shall we wait until the evidence is absolutely compelling?" asked Sagan. "Or shall we take prudent steps beforehand in case the vast majority of scientists are right?"
Kendall said two years ago he took an appeal from 55 American Nobel Laureates and 700 members of the National Academy of Sciences to U.S. President George Bush. "Uncertainty is no excuse for complacency," the appeal said. "Only by taking action now can we assure that future generations will not be put at risk."
The issue's beyond national or company interests. It's about insurance for my granddaughter's world. No global warming policy is adequate which fails to reckon her an argument.

Abstract: "The impact of global warming on agriculture may indeed be serious, especially if warming is at the upper end of the range projected," says the report produced for the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change. Some scientists have argued that global warming will help farmers because plant growth rates increase when there is more carbon dioxide in the air, and because warmer temperatures bring longer growing seasons in northern countries. Thawing of the permafrost in the sub-polar regions may release large quantities of methane gas, a powerful greenhouse agent. This would accelerate the warming process.

Full text: (CP) - Global warming may seriously affect world food production, says a report by a UN-sponsored committee of top climate scientists.
The unpublished report, a copy of which was obtained by The Canadian Press, raises serious questions about the ability of farmers to adapt to climate change.
"The impact of global warming on agriculture may indeed be serious, especially if warming is at the upper end of the range projected," says the report produced for the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change.
Average global temperatures are expected to rise in coming decades due to the accumulation of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Some scientists have argued that global warming will help farmers because plant growth rates increase when there is more carbon dioxide in the air, and because warmer temperatures bring longer growing seasons in northern countries.
Optimists also say biotechnology will produce new crops that can thrive in a greenhouse world.
But the UN report warns such benefits may be offset by drought, pollution, and more frequent insect infestations.
"While recent reviews have emphasized the possibilities of adaptation to climate change, it is important to remember that adaptation may not be complete, and that adaptation may have detrimental effects of its own.
"For example, modifying the types of crops does not guarantee equal levels or nutritional quality of food production or equal profits for farmers."
The report says the improvements brought by biotechnology likely won't be available to farmers in developing countries, and predicts greater desertification and famine in Africa.
Other findings:
The impact of global warming on the forest sector may be severe, especially in countries heavily dependent on forestry.
Snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has been at record low levels since the middle of 1987.
Thawing of the permafrost in the sub-polar regions may release large quantities of methane gas, a powerful greenhouse agent. This would accelerate the warming process.
The construction and insurance industries may be significantly affected by soil shrinkage and swelling of clay-rich soils.
Computer models developed in the former Soviet Union indicate that the agricultural production in that region would drop five to 10 per cent with a doubling of carbon dioxide levels.
Diseases such as malaria, river blindness and dengue fever could increase or be re-introduced in many countries.

Abstract: First, the bare facts. A NASA-led team using satellites and aircraft has discovered unexpected, extremely high levels of the most potent ozone-destroying chemical, comparable to, and even higher than levels found in the Antarctic ozone hole. Beneath them, however, were not penguins and phytoplankton, but London, Brussels, Berlin, Moscow and northern Maine. The results mean that the atmosphere is much less able than scientists previously thought to fend off the ozone-destroying effects of chlorofluorocarbons. The discovery greatly increases the likelihood that an ozone hole will soon develop in the Arctic. Unlike the Antarctic hole, which stays put over the South pole, an Arctic hole will slither around, periodically extending as far south as 45 degrees north latitude, north of which lies most of Europe and the former Soviet Union, Canada and several U.S. states. The new findings confirmed earlier predictions that sulfates tossed into the stratosphere in the eruption of Mt. Pinatubu would accelerate ozone loss. This is another instance of a seemingly unrelated man-made change (chlorine in the atmosphere) turning an uncontrollable and otherwise relatively benign natural event (a volcanic eruption) into a severe result. Trees bathed in acid rain succumb to natural outbreaks of pests and disease they would otherwise resist. Deforestation on steep hillsides in the Philippines turned a moderate typhoon last year into a human catastrophe of death by mudslide. On this crowded planet even acts of God are becoming acts of man.

Full text: More bad news from the upper atmosphere. What is one to make of it?
First, the bare facts. A NASA-led team using satellites and aircraft has discovered unexpected, extremely high levels of the most potent ozone-destroying chemical, comparable to, and even higher than levels found in the Antarctic ozone hole. Beneath them, however, were not penguins and phytoplankton, but London, Brussels, Berlin, Moscow and northern Maine. The results mean that the atmosphere is much less able than scientists previously thought to fend off the ozone-destroying effects of chlorofluorocarbons.
The discovery greatly increases the likelihood that an ozone hole will soon develop in the Arctic. Unlike the Antarctic hole, which stays put over the South pole, an Arctic hole will slither around, periodically extending as far south as 45 degrees north latitude, north of which lies most of Europe and the former Soviet Union, Canada and several U.S. states.
In years when the hole lasted for a long time, pockets of very high ozone depletion would persist into May and June, when the sun is strongest, exposing heavily populated areas to very high levels of ultraviolet radiation, raising rates of melanoma and cataracts. Effects on non-human species are less clear but possibly worse for them, and indirectly, for us.
The new findings confirmed earlier predictions that sulfates tossed into the stratosphere in the eruption of Mt. Pinatubu would accelerate ozone loss. This is another instance of a seemingly unrelated man-made change (chlorine in the atmosphere) turning an uncontrollable and otherwise relatively benign natural event (a volcanic eruption) into a severe result. Trees bathed in acid rain succumb to natural outbreaks of pests and disease they would otherwise resist. Deforestation on steep hillsides in the Philippines turned a moderate typhoon last year into a human catastrophe of death by mudslide. On this crowded planet even acts of God are becoming acts of man.
Happily, something can be done. Under the current terms of the Montreal Treaty, ozone loss will continue to grow until 2000. But revised terms requiring an accelerated phaseout of chlorofluorocarbons and tighter controls over related ozone-depleters can cut the inevitable loss significantly. Meanwhile, maximum diplomatic pressure needs to be exerted on India, the chief treaty holdout, to overcome its habitual antipathy to global problem solving and join the effort.
There is a moral here for policy makers. The findings confirmed a hunch scientists had about a recently discovered mechanism of atmospheric chemistry. There are lots and lots (hundreds, maybe even thousands) of things of comparable significance that we don't know about this planet, because it's study is a scientific frontier. Also, man is creating conditions that natural systems have never before encountered, which may trigger unpredictable shifts. For the next few decades, therefore, surprise will be a constant backdrop to decision making. It has to be expected - and accommodated.
Waiting for scientific certainty, the administration's constant plea, is obviously a non-starter. By that standard there would be no Montreal Treaty and no action possible even now. The only option is to learn to act in the presence of substantial doubt. The sensible way to do that is by taking relatively low-cost steps to reduce the risk of highly unpleasant outcomes - in the same spirit that we buy insurance.
The Senate reacted to the ozone news immediately, requiring tighter controls on the culprit chemicals by a vote of 96-0. The White House went so far as to withdraw its previous opposition, but it has further catching up to do. Regulations on CFCs required by Congress more than a year ago are overdue. Some have not emerged from EPA, others have disappeared into the regulatory black hole of the Quayle Council.
The news should give the administration pause as it reconsiders its posture on greenhouse warming. Without the 1987 Montreal agreement - which involved scientific uncertainty comparable to that surrounding climate change - the world would now be facing a truly frightening situation. As with ozone depletion, there are low-cost options for reducing greenhouse risks, principally through an energy policy that forcefully promotes efficiency. The energy bill now wending its way through Congress takes modest steps in the right direction and should pass this year now that the president has withdrawn his veto threat.
By all accounts, though, internal battles are raging. Skinner is looking for ways to soften the Sununu greenhouse policy. The right wing, encouraged by the president's gimmicky 90-day regulatory moratorium, is beating the drums for no action. The No. 1 item on the Heritage Foundation's agenda of "environmentally sound, free-market goals" for the coming Earth Summit is not to discuss greenhouse warming. It would be funny if it were not so self-defeating.
The Democratic candidates have said little about climate change, though they did electronically attend last week's candidate forum on the subject. Neither Bush nor Buchanan could find the time. Long-term issues are never salient in a presidential campaign, least of all in the midst of a recession. Still, advancing ozone loss is a useful reminder that candidates' thoughts - Republican no less than Democratic - on the future habitability of the planet are worth hearing this year.

Abstract: CHICAGO - Sulfur pollutants linked to acid rain may help block global warming in the short run, but so-called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide should overcome the cooling effect of sulfur in the long term, scientists said Friday. Recent computer calculations by U.S., German and Swedish scientists showed the "rather surprising" result that acidic sulfur particles in the atmosphere may be partly masking greenhouse warming, said Robert Charlson, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington. He and other scientists discussed recent findings on global warming and the greenhouse effect at the annual meeting here of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The greenhouse effect is a natural process in which carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane and other gases trap heat in the atmosphere. Without the greenhouse phenomenon, the planet would maintain constant below-zero temperatures.

Full text: CHICAGO - Sulfur pollutants linked to acid rain may help block global warming in the short run, but so-called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide should overcome the cooling effect of sulfur in the long term, scientists said Friday.
Recent computer calculations by U.S., German and Swedish scientists showed the "rather surprising" result that acidic sulfur particles in the atmosphere may be partly masking greenhouse warming, said Robert Charlson, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington. He and other scientists discussed recent findings on global warming and the greenhouse effect at the annual meeting here of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
The greenhouse effect is a natural process in which carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane and other gases trap heat in the atmosphere. Without the greenhouse phenomenon, the planet would maintain constant below-zero temperatures.
But the burning of coal, gas and other carbon-based materials is producing unprecedented amounts of additional carbon dioxide and other pollutants - enough that many experts believe the atmosphere is gradually warming, with potentially dangerous consequences.
By the middle of the next century, they say, the warming could make the Midwestern climate hotter and drier and trigger other major climate changes.
Critics say there's no evidence of that warming or any of its consequences.
At the science meeting, the researchers said that major uncertainties still exist on the question of how climate change is affected by clouds, snow, ice, ocean circulation and sulfur pollution.
The acidic sulfur particles that concern Charlson are not a component of the greenhouse gases. These particles, known as sulfates, form in the atmosphere as a haze from smelters and coal-burning power plants.
They are the root of acid rain, which has been damaging forests, lakes and other natural ecosystems downwind from the pollution source, scientists said.
Charlson and other researchers a decade ago had dismissed the importance of sulfates. But they examined the role of the particles after realizing that the Northern Hemisphere, where sulfate-producing industry is concentrated, seemed to be warming more slowly than the Southern Hemisphere.
The man-made sulfuric haze cools large parts of the industrial world by reflecting sunlight from the planet's surface, Charlson said. By keeping sunshine from reaching the ground, the haze partly counters the warming effect of carbon dioxide pollutants and other greenhouse gases.
But sulfur pollution should not be thought of as an ally against global warming, Charlson said. And new clean air regulations will lessen the amount of sulfur pollution released over North America and Europe.
"Sulfates last only a few days and are limited to the areas that produce them, but they come from the same pollution sources as carbon dioxide, which remains in the atmosphere for decades," he said.
"When we cut back on fossil-fuel burning, either by policy or because we've exhausted oil, the cooling effect of sulfates will taper off."
Thomas Karl, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said his recent analysis showed significant warming over many continents in the past 40 years.
Karl traced the history of daily high and low temperatures at various locations in the continental United States, Alaska, Canada, China and the former Soviet Union. He avoided data taken at weather stations near cities, where a "heat island effect" can distort regional temperature measurements.
Since 1951, he said, the average low has risen by about 1 degree Fahrenheit. The average high has risen by only about a third of that.
An accurate picture of how much the planet will warm in the coming decades is important because it will affect how trillions of dollars in global resources are used to address the problem, said Michael Schlesinger, a climate specialist at the University of Illinois.
Schlesinger said a 10-year delay in decision-making would have little environmental effect or ultimate cost. Such a delay would enable nations to more accurately respond to the global warming problem, he said.

Other scientists say steps aimed at stemming global warming would be a good insurance policy as well as beneficial to a cleaner environment and energy conservation even if global warming doesn't occur.
