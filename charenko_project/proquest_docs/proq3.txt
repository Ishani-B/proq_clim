Abstract: Another dandy 100-degree day is just what we need to inspire the pause that reflects. Do you ever go along all involved in your daily business and then something big happens to you or someone you love, and you realize you've been worrying about the wrong things? There you are, fretting about why you didn't get invited to some party or how to pay the phone bill when, wham, you find out you have cancer, and you realize your priorities are all wrong. Thinking seriously about the environment often does the same thing to our sense of public priorities. The state of the environment is the global equivalent of cancer, and most of us are still worrying about the wrong things.

There you are, fretting about why you didn't get invited to some party or how to pay the phone bill when, wham, you find out you have cancer, and you realize your priorities are all wrong.
Thinking seriously about the environment often does the same thing to our sense of public priorities. The state of the environment is the global equivalent of cancer, and most of us are still worrying about the wrong things.
Much of this phenomenon is the media's fault, naturally. Most of us have so little scientific expertise, we report bad science along with good science as though it were all equal.
The most glaring example is that idiotic education debate in which we continue to say, `Well, evolution is only a theory, so we might as well teach creation `science' along with evolution since some people believe in creationism.'
Some people still believe the Earth is flat. Gravity is still only a theory, too, but when you drop something, it seldom falls up.
Science consists of knowledge that can be proven by experiment. It is tentative only in the sense that some day an experiment might yield different results: Someday, you may drop something and have it fall up - science doesn't shut off possibilities.
The media have failed most noticeably in reporting the empirical evidence concerning the ozone layer. It is not a debatable phenomenon.
True, there are some scientists, and Rush Limbaugh, still denying there is a problem. But if ozone depletion were a political question, the media would quickly recognize the difference between `reliable sources' and those few, overpublicized, financially motivated, ill-informed dissenters.
Contrary to recent reportage, the depletion of the ozone layer is not getting better or even approaching improvement: It's steadily getting worse, while nations, including ours, continue to drag their feet on banning the chemicals responsible and a brisk international smuggling trade in CFCs has already developed.
A perfect example of how greed leads to stupidity: The replacements for chlorofluorocarbons now cost about five times as much as CFCs themselves. In order to save themselves that fivefold expense, industries are willing to use ozone-depleting chemicals, even those smuggled in, a traffic now second only to drugs. Mark Dowie, in a fine piece of investigative reporting in the July 8 Nation, marshals the appalling evidence, including the politics of getting rid of methyl bromide, used in pesticides.
Gwynne Dyer, reporting on the International Climate Change Conference last month in Geneva, traced much of the rotten science and misinformation about global warming to oil-exporting countries and to the misleadingly named Global Climate Coalition, which has buckets of money since it is funded by Shell, Texaco, Exxon, BP Amoco, Chevron and Mobil, plus Dow Chemical, Union Carbide, etc.
Look, there is a continent-sized hole in the ozone layer of Antarctica, where the penguins are dying. The ozone values are falling over the Northern Hemisphere, and the connection between the greenhouse effect and climate change becomes ever clearer.
True, there have been droughts before in Texas and blizzards before in the Northeast, but here's one happy piece of news: The insurance industry is really upset. Payouts for storm damage from 1990 to 1995 already total $48 billion, three times the figure for the 1980s. Fifty-eight international insurance companies went to Geneva to demand `early substantial reductions' in greenhouse-gas emissions.
When science takes on something the size of the fossil fuel industry, it's always nice to have something the size of the insurance industry on our side. ******************************************************************** ****

Abstract: An increasing number of scientists blame global warming for an increase in "extreme" weather. They predict more of the same as greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels cause the planet to warm, distorting global weather patterns. In the experiment we're pumping vast amounts of greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide - into the atmosphere. These gases act like an insulation blanket - the more there are, the hotter the globe. Last year was the hottest on record with an average surface temperature of 15.4 C, 0.4 degrees above the 1961- 90 average. Environment Canada recently tested the computer models that predict these climactic flip-flops. They ran a program to simulate Canada's general weather patterns from 1850 to 2050. For the first 140 years the computer's predictions matched historical data. But by 1990 it became obvious our climate was drifting away from the computer models. When greenhouse gases are factored in and the global temperature increases, the computer started guessing right again.

Full text: Some researchers say global warming causing extreme weather
The global weather report for July ranged from wild and wet to weird.
Here's a sampling of the jolts nature delivered:
- The worst floods in a century ravaged southern China, killing more than 1,500 people. Freak snowstorms in South Africa killed 20.
- Closer to home, a storm that dumped more than 27.7 cm of rain in two days triggered floods in the Saguenay region of Quebec, leaving 10 dead and millions of dollars in damage. The same week a Chicago suburb got even more rain - 42.5 cm in 24 hours, the second greatest amount in U.S. history.
- In Alberta, Calgary was pounded - twice in eight days - by hailstones as big as oranges. The damage toll: $100 million. And a thunderstorm spawning tornadoes and torrential rain caused millions of dollars in damage to three communities near Edmonton.
What's going on?
An increasing number of scientists blame global warming for an increase in "extreme" weather. They predict more of the same as greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels cause the planet to warm, distorting global weather patterns.
Weather is notoriously variable and there will always be occasional extreme situations, says Henry Hengeveld, head climate change researcher at Environment Canada's Atmospheric Environment Service.
A climate extremes index in the United States tracking nasty weather shows large periodic fluctuations in the last 80 years. And it supports the notion the weather is becoming more extreme in the last decade or so.
"We have quite unintentionally started a long-term, global-scale geophysical experiment with the life-support system of this planet," Gordon McBean of Canada's Atmospheric Environment Service told a recent World Meteorological Organization conference in Geneva.
In the experiment we're pumping vast amounts of greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide - into the atmosphere. These gases act like an insulation blanket - the more there are, the hotter the globe. Last year was the hottest on record with an average surface temperature of 15.4 C, 0.4 degrees above the 1961- 90 average.
The more rapidly this process occurs, the more weather surprises, says Stephen Schneider, one of the foremost climate change scientists in the U.S.
The computer models scientists use to study what will happen if greenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere suggest more extremes of wet and dry.
As the Earth warms, more evaporation occurs resulting in worse droughts in arid areas and heavier rain in moist areas. Turning up the heat also means more energy in the atmosphere to crank up the intensity of hurricanes, cyclones and thunderstorms.
But not everyone believes these predictions. Skeptics have long knocked the computer models and produced studies to debunk the notion that mankind is to blame for the rise in global temperatures.
Richard Lindzen, an atmospheric physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says the models are as trustworthy as Ouija boards.
He believes a number of factors including an increase in cloud cover and aerosols - tiny particles of sulphur dioxide and other chemicals produced along with carbon dioxide emissions which block sunlight and help cool the atmosphere - will minimize or even nullify most effects of a greenhouse gas buildup.
Last fall, the International Panel on Climate Change, a UN- sponsored body of 1,500 climate experts from 60 nations, said the global temperature increase is partly caused by human activity.
The IPPC said improved climate models that took the effect of aerosols into account still showed a rise of global temperatures by as much as four degrees by 2100. Warming of the same magnitude at the end of the last Ice Age - some 12,000 years ago - was enough to send the vast ice sheets that covered most of Canada retreating to the polar region.
Last month, industrialized nations meeting in Geneva paid heed, and agreed to find ways of halving greenhouses gases within 50 years.
Among those urging action was the property insurance industry. Their losses from storm and flood claims have soared in recent years to $20 billion in payouts in 1992.
But even believers are cautious about linking global warming to specific extreme weather events.
"You cannot say that because you've had a few weird, wild and woolly weather surprises, that this is proof positive the world is starting to warm up and global warming has arrived," says Phillips.
Despite his skepticism, Phillips believes in global warming. "The one statistic that really impressed me was that in the 150 years of temperature records from across the globe, 11 of the 12 warmest years occurred since 1980."
In the last century, the average temperature around the globe has increased by 0.5 degrees Celsius. During that time Canada's average has increased by one degree.
Since 1980, Canada has had nearly twice as many hot and wet spells than expected.
Environment Canada recently tested the computer models that predict these climactic flip-flops. They ran a program to simulate Canada's general weather patterns from 1850 to 2050. For the first 140 years the computer's predictions matched historical data. But by 1990 it became obvious our climate was drifting away from the computer models. When greenhouse gases are factored in and the global temperature increases, the computer started guessing right again.
Hengeveld admits current computer models are overly simplistic. But, he says, it's better to take action now than to wait for conclusive evidence.
Some researchers believe that sudden and violent storms, such as this lightning storm in the desert north of Scottsdale, Ariz., are linked to global warming

Abstract: An increasing number of scientists blame global warming for an increase in what they term ``extreme'' weather. They predict more of the same as greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels cause the planet to warm, distorting global weather patterns. ``The whole emphasis on global warming up until now has been on temperatures,'' says David Phillips, senior climatologist at Environment Canada. ``I don't think the big threat is from warmer temperatures, I think it's from extremes. It's the extremes that cause the pain, the dislocation, the economic losses and the misery.'' Weather is notoriously variable and there will always be occasional extreme situations, says Henry Hengeveld, head climate change researcher at Environment Canada's Atmospheric Environment Service.

Full text: Feature on global weather trends
The global weather report for last month ranged from wild and wet to just plain weird.
Just a sampling of the jolts that nature delivered in July:
* The worst floods in a century ravaged Southern China, killing more than 1,500 people. Freak snowstorms in South Africa killed 20 and trapped villagers without food and water.
* Closer to home, a storm that dumped more than 27.7 cm of rain in two days triggered floods in the Saguenay region of Quebec, leaving 10 dead and millions of dollars in damage. The same week a Chicago suburb got even more rain -- 42.5 cm in 24 hours, the second greatest amount in U.S. history
* In Alberta, Calgary was pounded by hailstones as big as oranges twice in eight days. The expected damage toll: $100 million. And a thunderstorm spawning tornadoes and torrential rain caused millions of dollars in damage in Spruce Grove, Stony Plain and Tofield.
Nor did this July corner the market on unusual weather. Just ask Edmontonians. After a long, cold winter we endured the third dullest May in our recorded history.
So what's going on?
An increasing number of scientists blame global warming for an increase in what they term ``extreme'' weather. They predict more of the same as greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels cause the planet to warm, distorting global weather patterns.
``The whole emphasis on global warming up until now has been on temperatures,'' says David Phillips, senior climatologist at Environment Canada. ``I don't think the big threat is from warmer temperatures, I think it's from extremes. It's the extremes that cause the pain, the dislocation, the economic losses and the misery.''
Weather is notoriously variable and there will always be occasional extreme situations, says Henry Hengeveld, head climate change researcher at Environment Canada's Atmospheric Environment Service.
``It's like rolling dice continually -- every once in a while you get double sixes.''
But a scan of weather over the last few years suggests that double sixes are the bettor's favorite around the globe.
A climate extremes index in the United States that tracks nasty weather shows large periodic fluctuations in the last 80 years. But it supports the notion that the weather is becoming more extreme in the last decade or so.
``In the past we've always assumed that historical patterns of weather are a good indicator of the probability of extreme events in the future,'' says Hengeveld. ``That just doesn't hold true any more.''
Like a majority of climatologists, Hengeveld thinks global warming might be weighting the weather dice.
``We have quite unintentionally started a long-term, global-scale geophysical experiment with the life-support system of this planet,'' Gordon McBean of Canada's Atmospheric Environment Service told a recent World Meteorological Organization conference in Geneva.
In the experiment we're pumping vast amounts of greenhouse gases -- particularly carbon dioxide but also methane and nitrous oxide from burning fossil fuels -- into the atmosphere. These gases act like an insulation blanket -- the more there are, the hotter the globe will get. Last year was the hottest on record with an average surface temperature of 15.4 C, 0.4 degrees above the 1961-90 average.
The more rapidly this process occurs, the more likely the climate system will produce surprises, says Stephen Schneider, one of the foremost climate change scientists in the United States.
The powerful computer models scientists use to study what will happen if greenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere suggest more extremes of wet and dry.
As the earth warms, more evaporation occurs resulting in worse droughts in arid areas and heavier rain in moist areas. Turning up the heat also means more energy in the atmosphere to crank up the intensity of hurricanes, cyclones and thunderstorms.
But not everyone believes the predictions. Skeptics have long knocked the computer models and have produced studies of their own to debunk the whole notion that mankind is to blame for the rise in global temperatures.
Dr. Richard Lindzen, an atmospheric physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says the models are as trustworthy as Ouija boards.
Lindzen, a leader of the skeptics, believes that a number of atmospheric factors including an increase in cloud cover and aerosals -- tiny particles of sulphur dioxide and other chemicals produced along with carbon dioxide emissions which block sunlight and help cool the atmosphere -- will minimize or even nullify most effects of a greenhouse gas buildup.
Energy industries and governments have been only too eager to seize on such conclusions to stall action on reduction of greenhouse emissions.
But last fall, the International Panel on Climate Change, a UN-sponsored body of some 1,500 leading climate experts from 60 nations, said the global temperature increase is at least partly caused by human activity.
The IPPC said improved climate models that took the effect of aerosols into account still showed a rise of global temperatures by as much as 4 degrees by 2100. Warming of the same magnitude at the end of the last Ice Age some 12,000 years ago was enough to send the vast ice sheets that covered most of Canada retreating to polar regions.
Last month, industrialized nations meeting in Geneva paid heed, and agreed to find ways of halving global output of greenhouses gases within 50 years. But their performance so far hardly breeds optimism. Carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise since the 1992 Earth Summit agreement to roll them back to 1990 levels.
Among those urging action was the property insurance industry. Their losses from storm and flood claims have soared in recent years to a high of $20 billion in payouts in 1992. They're firm believers in the link between global warming and the frequency and intensity of storms and droughts.
But even believers are cautious about linking global warming to specific extreme weather events.
``You cannot say that because you've had a few weird, wild and woolly weather surprises, that this is proof positive that the world is starting to warm up and global warming has arrived,'' says Phillips.
More information is needed, he says, not only to prove that global warming is responsible for such extremes, but even to conclusively show that our weather is any worse than its usual fickle self.
He has examined weather throughout history and claims he can top any weird weather story we hear these days with examples from the past.
``You can get a very biased sense of weather extremes because you're being exposed to them not only locally, but nationally and internationally. Every night you're seeing pictures of devastating floods in China or snow storms in Africa.''
Improved communication and monitoring technology in recent years mean that more weather incidents get reported, says Phillips.
``We report nearly three times as many tornadoes now than we did 30 years ago. That doesn't mean there are more tornadoes. It just means that we are more aware, that there are more camcorders, more cellular telephones, radar and satellites.''
Despite his skepticism, Phillips has turned from a doubting Thomas into a true believer in global warming.
``I think the one statistic that really impressed me was that in the 150 years of temperature records from across the globe, 11 of the 12 warmest years occurred since 1980.''
In the last century, the average temperature around the globe has increased by 0.5 degrees Celsius. During that time Canada's average has increased by one degree. Most of these increases have come in the last two decades.
Since 1980, Canada has had nearly twice as many hot and wet spells as expected.
Environment Canada recently tested the computer models that predict these climactic flip-flops.
Using one of the country's most powerful computers, they ran a program to simulate Canada's general weather patterns from 1850 to 2050. For the first 140 years the computer's predictions successfully matched historical data. But by 1990 it became obvious that our climate was drifting away from the computer's models.
When greenhouse gases are factored in, and the global temperature increases, the computer started guessing right again.
Hengeveld admits current computer models are overly simplistic. For example, they haven't been able to factor in the role the oceans play in any detail.
``Ultimately, we need a model that tries to simulate how the earth ticks. That's a real challenge. It's almost arrogant to think that we could do that,'' says Hengeveld.
But along with most climate change experts and the insurance industry, he argues it's better to take action now than to wait for conclusive evidence.
``We could do an awful lot through measures that have no net cost to society,'' he says.
``The key one there is energy efficiency. Even if down the road it turns out the scientists are wrong, you should have done it anyway.''
In Geneva last month, Environment Minister Sergio Marchi once again renewed Canada's pledge -- at the Rio de Janeiro summit in 1992 -- to stabilize its greenhouse gas emissions.
But he also had to admit that Canada's effort to reduce emissions to 1990 levels was falling short. By 2000 they could in fact be 13 per cent higher, he said.
``Canada,'' he told the conference, ``must work harder, faster and smarter.''
ALBERTA'S LONG, LONG RANGE FORECAST
In a five-year study, Agriculture Canada and University of Lethbridge researchers tracked Alberta's weather for the past century and used computer models to peer into a globally warmer future.
Their prediction: temperatures will rise by as much as 2 C across the province and 5 C in some parts of southern Alberta in the next 50 years, assuming no major shifts in policy on greenhouse gas emissions.
THE UPSIDE
The current 100-day growing season could increase by 20 to 40 days, giving us conditions similar to those that now exist 800 to 1,000 km farther south. Alberta farmers will be able to grow a greater diversity of crops, including corn, soybeans and winter cereals. And because of earlier harvests, they'll have time to reseed and reap a fast-growing second crop.
THE DOWNSIDE
More crop losses from droughts and maurading insects. Our long, cold winters wipe out many insect species. With milder winters, grasshoppers, cutworms and other pests will become more prevalent.
The researchers are now examining the social and economic impacts of these predictions. They expect to complete their work by next summer.

Full text: ACTS OF GOD? The storm that sparked the severe flooding in Quebec is part of a global trend toward severe weather. Is it global warming, or not? The jury is still out.
An act of God. The power of Mother Nature. Faced with the terrible devastation of eastern Quebec, eye-witnesses took refuge in stock phrases.
The storm that battered the Saguenay was, indeed, remarkable. More than 27 centimetres of rain fell -- three times the normal amount for the entire month of July.
The wetness of the soil and the fullness of local reservoirs heightened the calamity.
But if you take a step back from those images of sunken houses and collapsed highways, of destitute families and flooded towns, a troubling larger picture begins to emerge. True, the flooding across the Saguenay, Charlevoix and North Shore was unprecedented for the region. But on a broader scale, such sudden extremes of weather appear to be growing more common than at any time in history.
For Quebecers, the July inundation will probably go down as ``the flood of the century.''
The same words have been used to describe the flooding that laid waste to Alberta in 1995, to the southeastern U.S. in 1994 and to a vast swath of the Mississippi basin in 1993. Pity the Dutch: they endured a ``flood of the century'' in December 1993, followed by another in February 1995.
``Certainly in North America,'' said Henry Hengeveld, senior adviser on climate change at Environment Canada, ``there has been a trend toward extreme weather events. I would caution, however, that it is very difficult to ascribe the Saguenay events to a particular cause.''
Unnatural patterns
Climatologists are cautious folk. Not for them the day-by-day perturbations of weather; they take a loftier view. They know the world to be infinitely complex. In the face of ``natural variability,'' unnatural patterns are never easy to prove.
``But the consensus,'' said Chris Flavin, vice-president for research at the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, D.C., ``is that we are already outside the realm of natural variability. Most scientists think we're already witnessing the beginning of climate change.''
In truth, climates have always changed -- and those changes have often had an impact on human societies. When the Vikings sailed from Norway to settle in Iceland, Greenland and North America a thousand years ago, they were blessed by a rare spell of warmth in the North Atlantic. Once that period ended and the climate cooled off, the Vikings could no longer sustain life in Newfoundland and Greenland.
But if Flavin is right, we're standing on the threshold of something new: an age when our climate is no longer purely ``natural.'' An age when ``acts of God'' might be blamed, at least in part, on the behavior of human beings.
Flavin believes -- along with the eminent scientists who wrote a 1993 assessment for the International Panel on Climate Change -- that global warming is no longer just an interesting theory; global warming is a reality. And this time, unlike other periods in history, the climate change is partly man-made, a result of the emission of ``greenhouse'' gases.
In this wet and windy summer, the notion of global warming might be hard to digest. But the evidence is clear: since 1860, the 10 warmest years on record have been among the last 15. Greenhouse gases are taking their toll: between 1959 and 1994, concentrations of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere rose by 14 per cent.
And most striking, perhaps, the world's weather is starting to misbehave exactly as the computer models predict. Which takes us back to the ravaged streets of Chicoutimi and Jonquiere. Because, in Hengeveld's words, ``with warmer climates, we should see -- especially in summer --more intense rainfall events.''
``The kind of flooding events we've seen in Quebec are good indications of what we should see more frequently in the future -- if the models are correct. They're a reminder that the effect of climate change on human society and ecosystems will be felt most painfully in extreme events, rather than by gradual change.''
To most Canadians, the advent of global warming might seem welcome. But as Hengeveld reminds us, global warming means something more than just earlier springs and slushier winters; it also means an increase in the number of brutal, unpredictable storms.
``Climate will not just change in future; it is doing so today.'' The words are not those of some frightened environmentalist, but of the giant Swiss Re insurance company, in a 1994 report entitled Global Warming: Element of Risk. ``The danger of unmanageable extreme weather situations is therefore not a future threat but already an acute one.''
It has taken the insurance business (one of the largest in the world) to sound the alarm bells about the impact of global warming. The reason is simple: climate change threatens to bankrupt the industry.
The Swiss report posits scenarios in which, as a result of disastrous weather events, ``the urban system will collapse within days. It is not uncertain that, when major cities are affected, extreme weather situations will cause inconceivably high damage, in the range of one or more per cent of the gross national product, with unmanageable consequences.
How would we cope?
``One possible effect of global climatic change is that cities might have to be abandoned, just as human settlements were in the past. Nobody knows how to cope with such an eventuality.''
Fortunately, all this remains hypothetical. Nobody can say for sure that the storms in eastern Quebec arose from anything other than freak weather and bad luck.
On the mere existence of global warming, there are still a few skeptics -- though Flavin of the Worldwatch Institute likens them to the handful of doctors who persist in denying a causal link between smoking and cancer.
One of the skeptics is Gerald Bell, a meteorologist who works for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Bell points out that natural forces, such as the Pacific phenomenon of El Nino and the ``North Atlantic oscillation,'' exert the greatest power over our daily weather:
``Global temperatures have increased, but that still could be just natural variation. The issue is not closed at all. My skepticism is, there are so many other things of such greater magnitude and larger time-scales, how can you look at anything and call it an effect of global warming?''
``What we're talking about,'' Hengeveld responds, ``is large-scale global change that also begins to affect variability on a shorter scale. It's important to distinguish between climate and weather. Remember, if the base levels change as a result of global warming, then the fluctuations will change as well. And if our models are correct, we should see fewer low-level events (such as drizzle in summer) and more intense events (such as thunderstorms).''
Even El Nino might be linked to global warming. After a giant El Nino in 1981-82 and a moderate one in 1986-'87, the Pacific experienced a kind of small-scale, four-year El Nino between 1991 and 1995. One way to think about El Nino is as a vehicle through which the tropics release heat energy by bringing it to the ocean's surface -- in which case, global climate change might well have contributed to El Nino's odd activity.
Aside from global warming, other factors link the Saguenay inundation with recent floods around the world. At the same time as all hell was breaking loose in Chicoutimi and La Baie, large chunks of Rome, Bangladesh and southern China were also under water.
After the waters had begun to recede in the Saguenay, some local residents suggested that Quebec's system of managing dams played a part in the disaster.
This week, provincial Environment Minister David Cliche rejected the charge -- though he admitted that he will now consider forcing privately owned dams to meet government inspections.
In eastern Quebec, as in many other places, dams exist for two purposes: water storage and flood prevention.
At moments of extreme weather, those aims might be incompatible.
Here again, there are links to a much broader pattern: one in which human interference with nature comes with a high price.
Jean Vallee, a professor of geotechnical engineering at the Universite du Quebec a Chicoutimi, has called part of the Saguenay flooding ``nature's revenge.''
There are good short-term economic reasons for deforestation, soil depletion, urbanization, dam-building and other such activities. In the long run, though, these actions can lead to massive environmental problems.
``Removal of wetlands really does cause problems,'' noted Jim O'Brien of Florida State University. In the case of the Mississippi, the people who got flooded were living in the flood plain, where they shouldn't have been in the first place. Don't forget that the rich farming land that's in river bottoms has been put there by previous floods.''
The Swiss report on global warming is unequivocal: ``The 1993 flood was due to the creation in the Mississippi River of a man-made system which was exposed to widespread damage or even total destruction from the effect of heavy rainfall.''
After the ravages in northwestern Europe 18 months ago, many people expressed a similar sentiment. ``We've been raping the land,'' said Klaudia Martini, environment minister in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, ``and we've got to change that.''
The European floods, it's generally accepted, were not just the product of heavy winter rainfall.
They also resulted from the way in which mechanized agriculture had reduced the ground's capacity to absorb water -- coupled with engineering work that had straightened and corseted rivers for ease of transportation. In that respect last weekend, the Ha! Ha! River was imitating the Rhine.
In Bangladesh, likewise, annual flooding of the Ganges river system has long been a fact of life. But the new brutality of those floods stems from human action: the deforestation of the Himalayas, along with the attempted manipulation of the Ganges by upstream dams in India.
``Over the next 40 years,'' warned Constance Hunt, freshwater-ecosystems specialist for the World Wildlife Fund in Washington, D.C., ``humanity's ability to appropriate fresh water is expected to grow by 10 per cent. Yet our population is expected to grow by 45 per cent. As river systems are engineered and as populations grow, there are two direct consequences: deforestation and an increase in soil erosion. In short, the landscape is losing its ability to absorb precipitation.''
Weight of evidence
Despite the impressive weight of evidence, Hunt says, we can't be certain that global climate change is causing extreme events like the Saguenay flood.
``But we do know there are things we can do as a society to lessen their impact. We can improve soil and water conservation. We can restore wetlands. We can manage flood plains in non-structural ways, rather than channellizing and enclosing our rivers. And we can improve storm-water management in urban areas.''
Acts of God or otherwise, days of tremendous rainfall will always be with us. But the destruction caused by floods is now, in part, our own responsibility.

Full text: BOULDER, Colo. -- Professor and writer Judith Jacobsen has been sounding the alarm for years:
The United States is growing too fast, straining its ability to deal with the spinoffs of growth -- pollution, congestion, urban sprawl and the consumption of natural resources such as land and water.
Increasing population, she says, is not the path to prosperity. To some, it is not a popular position -- particularly in Utah, which boasts the highest birthrate in the nation.
But to Jacobsen, it is the gospel, and she has been preaching it in classrooms, at conferences and in research papers for more than a decade.
While some may consider her cause controversial, she avoids controversy. The 43-year-old woman has no children, but never lectures friends with three or four. She prefers encouraging societal change over one-on-one confrontations with those who oppose her. She leaves that to her husband, a scientist who enjoys debating his own specialty: climate change.
Above all, she is patient and a political realist, a surprising makeup for someone who has a clear view of a possibly ugly future.
Yet that forward-thinking has made her a small part of history.
Two weeks ago, a presidential task force she helped lead released a report that calls for curbing U.S. population growth. It was the first time that a presidential council has made such a recommendation.
The report concludes that the nation must slow its population growth promptly and reduce wasteful consumption -- or risk a declining quality of life for future generations.
But most significant to Jacobsen, the conclusion came not only from academics and environmentalists, but also from corporate executives and economic thinkers.
``This statement represents the strongest, deepest, broadest consensus -- at the highest level -- that we should stabilize U.S. population growth,'' said Jacobsen, a professor at the University of Denver.
What impact the report will have is not clear. Some say it probably will become part of President Clinton's platform as he continues to court the votes of environmentalists.
Nothing in the report carries the weight of law. Clinton can ignore any of its recommendations.
But Jacobsen believes the whole of the report is more important than each of its recommendations. Taken as a single document, she said, it can be used to pressure politicians and policy-makers by showing there is a broad-based concern about the population's impact on the environment.
Indeed, at its current growth rate of 1 percent, the United States -- now with a population of 263 million -- adds 3 million people a year. That means the country probably will grow to more than 350 million by 2030. That is the equivalent of adding another Connecticut every year, or another California every decade.
Advocates of population stabilization say that at some point the stress of so many people on water, air and earth will send quality of life into a tailspin.
In 1968, author Paul Ehrlich was ridiculed widely for his book, The Population Bomb, in which he predicted famines and resource depletion if the human race did not stop growing. Many people, particularly economists, thought the notion absurd.
Jacobsen, however, says there are plenty of people who believe technology will save us from ourselves, providing enough food, for example, for a much larger population. Then there are those who simply deny that people can be creating environmental problems.
``They say, `We as humans can't be making that kind of dent. . . . The Earth is huge, we simply aren't going to run out of things.' ''
Claudine Schneider, a board member of the Competitiveness Policy Council, agrees that the days of economists blindly preaching the worship of growth are ``as passe as a couple of dinosaurs.''
She said economists now take a much wider view of growth, incorporating the impact of cars and congestion on quality of life, for example.
Much of the problem, the council concluded, could be dealt with by confronting the simple fact that every year, almost 60 percent of all pregnancies and 40 percent of all births in the United States either are mistimed or unwanted.
To counter that, the council recommends improving education about -- and access to -- contraceptives, increasing reproductive education and services for teens and requiring insurance companies and Medicaid to pay for more birth control and family-planning options.
But Jacobsen also supports -- and the president's council endorsed -- what many might consider more radical measures: eliminating subsidies and tax breaks for corporations that sell natural resources, like timber and minerals.
Though it would not have a direct impact on population growth, it would make many goods more expensive, reflecting what the report calls the ``true price'' of the items. Experts reason it would reduce consumption of natural resources.
She fears that the nation will wait until it is too late to take a potential population crisis seriously -- that facts and numbers will not stir people to action.
``The sheer logic of science doesn't seem to move people much. Crisis is more powerful than logic.''

Full text: Reports of the suffering of flood victims in the Saguenay region triggered massive and much-needed help from governments, corporations and individuals.
But reports of the financial damage could lead to something even more lasting -- stronger support for protecting the environment.
The insurance industry will be watching anxiously as estimates continue to soar well past the $1-billion mark for damages associated with last week's torrential rains. The fear is that this is not a random event, but part of a growing pattern of weather disturbances around the globe. It's a pattern that could potentially bankrupt the international insurance industry and, for that reason, officials are increasingly concerned about global warming.
Insurance claims for weather-related disasters went from $16 billion for the decade of the eighties to $48 billion for just the first half of the nineties, according to the annual report on global trends from the Worldwatch Institute, a respected Washington, D.C., research organization.
Violent storms are happening more frequently. It's not possible to blame every hurricane, monster hail storm, flood or typhoon on global warming. But last year's average global temperature was the warmest since record keeping began. The 10 warmest years in the last 130 have all occurred since 1980 and the three warmest were in this decade.
In 1995 also, global emissions of carbon from fossil fuel broke a new record at 6.06 billion tons, indicating that industrialized countries are failing to meet their goal of limiting these emissions that was set at the 1992 Earth Summit.
Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change by accumulating in the atmosphere and trapping the sun's heat. Although it is also released by natural systems, including forests, most of the scientific community agrees the recent rise in carbon accumulation in the atmosphere is not due to natural causes.
Developing countries haven't even set reduction targets yet but industrial countries aimed to cut their carbon emissions back to 1990 levels by the end of decade. Many, including Canada and the United States, are falling short.
If policies aren't changed and dependence on fossil fuels not reduced, global carbon emissions from fossil-fuel burning could reach seven billion tons by 2000. The world's oceans and forests can absorb only about three billion tons of that.
More than 50 European insurance firms joined forces in Geneva this month to tell delegates to an international climate conference that they're convinced climate changes will mean more frequent, costly storms and droughts.
The Worldwatch Institute calls the entry of the insurance industry into the debate on climate change ``a potential watershed.''
As a business on the front lines of society's most risky activities, the industry has a long tradition of spurring policy changes to help reduce risks -- fire codes for buildings and air bag requirements for automobiles are two important examples.
In its latest report, Vital Signs 1996, The Trends That Are Shaping Our Future, the institute notes the insurance industry's total size is similar to the huge fossil-fuel industry, which has worked so hard in recent years to discourage governments from taking strong action to slow global warming. These two titans may soon go head to head on the global climate issue.
It's too bad that the cost in dollars is what prompts action instead of the cost to people in personal pain and misery. But if that's what it takes to save the environment, we'll take it.

Full text:   A tiny white house that refused to budge is now the official icon of that terrible ``freak'' flood in Quebec that was caused by torrential downpours.
Remember the television footage of the determined house? The way it squatted in the raging river, seeming perilously close to being swept away, yet never giving up?
We now see it played again and again on our television screens, between Olympic events that have kept many of us inside in this summer of unpredictable weather.
First the house appears, then a booming but kindly voice lauds Canadians for donating in the past to people from other countries who've been blindsided by natural disasters and other misfortunes.
But, says the voice, it's time for us to do the same for suffering people in our own back yards, who because of the flood are without the necessities of life.
And Canadians are. The same people who each week probably do their little bit for the environment by washing out some soup cans for the old blue box, or maybe topping up their tank with some ethanol, are digging deep into their pockets.
The Canadian Red Cross has said it hoped for $2 million in donations to help people in the Saguenay region. They've already got more than $3 million.
We had better have deep pockets if this is the way we want to deal with these disasters. For there is weird and deadly weather around the globe.
Scientists suspect these so-called ``freak'' natural disasters are going to become only more frequent. There already are signs. Last week, floods caused by heavy rains killed 1,500 people in China, 245 in Bangladesh and India and 10 in Quebec. And we can't forget the ``freak'' hail storms, which have been bruising vehicles across the Prairies with meteor-sized chunks of ice.
This weekend, The Globe and Mail cited United Nations figures showing that between 1963 and 1992, the number of floods around the world causing major damage increased from two every five years to 24. The number of floods causing at least 100 deaths more than doubled.
The same media report detailed international talks in Geneva earlier this month, where 57 European insurance firms issued a statement saying they believe man-made climate change will probably increase the frequency of storms and drought.
These firms urged 150 countries to dramatically reduce carbon emissions that many scientists believe are negatively affecting temperature and rainfall.
While there's no way to directly blame global warming for these disasters, it seems obvious we are finally beginning to see the predicted effects -- that many politicians and business types have long dismissed as bunk -- of unchecked industrialization and pollution on the Earth's climate.
Which brings us back to the Quebec flood and people's generous response.
It's a great short-term, knee-jerk reaction, all this cheque writing. But what about the long term? How deep are we prepared to dig to actually make a concrete difference in what seems to be a future of freak disasters?
This is more than an abstract question, when you consider what the Ontario government is about to do.
As many as half of Ontario's regulations designed to protect the environment are expected to be revoked or revamped. Some time this week, a report entitled Responsive Environmental Protection that recommends those changes is expected to be released. The big question is, responsive to whom?
Environmentalists fear the Tory plan will make it easier for industry, which was involved in drafting this report, to duck anti-pollution laws and reduce efforts to protect the environment. This is exactly the wrong time to be taking this backward step.
And deregulation is a global trend.
Federal Environment Minister Sergio Marchi meets this week with NAFTA partners Mexico and the United States to try to get them to resist a global push to slacken environmental standards. Regulations like the Montreal Protocol, that protects the ozone layer, are constantly being attacked by countries that consider them trade barriers.
The environment used to be a hot issue, ranking number one in opinion polls. Now, it wouldn't even make it from the heats to the medal podium where jobs and the deficit always place.
Some politicians and industries know that, and figure they can beat up on the Earth without anyone really caring too much.
All of us who are donating to help clean up this latest natural disaster might consider the big picture, for one thing seems certain. Pretty soon, ``freak'' won't be used to describe these increasingly commonplace disasters.
No one's pockets are that deep.

Abstract: The IPCC report (Volume II) also summarizes the scientific knowledge relating to the impacts of climate change on numerous human and ecological systems, including human health. The chapter on human health recognizes that climate change increases the risk of mortality because of heat waves and reduces the risk of mortality from cold weather. More people live in hot climates than in cold climates, so climate change is likely to increase mortality.

ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE
Off base on greenhouse report
Monday, July 29, 1996
IN his columns of July 16 and 17, Terence Corcoran relies on false allegations, selective quotation and scaremongering to reach his conclusion that "the drive to control greenhouse emissions is mostly in the grip of an unwieldy political machine, driven by environmentalists with ideologies and beliefs that are not based on science or economics."
Approximately 100 national governments have unanimously agreed that there are sound scientific and economic grounds for prudent action to address climate change. Their conclusions are based on the recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) prepared by several hundred of the world's leading scientists and peer-reviewed by more than 2,000 others, including industry experts.
Despite Mr. Corcoran's claim that the IPCC report has "been altered at the last minute to expunge certain qualifications and doubts in the minds of many scientists about global warming," all of its 36 authors and contributors have confirmed that they agreed to the wording of the final text and that, in their judgment, it fairly presents the evidence of human influence on climate change. These statements have been published by The Wall Street Journal, although Mr. Corcoran chooses to ignore them.
He quotes from the report that "Our ability to quantify the human influence on global climate is limited because the expected signal is still emerging from the noise of natural variability, and because there are uncertainties in key factors." He neglects to quote the conclusion of the paragraph which reads: "Nevertheless, the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate." The full text was adopted unanimously by representatives of approximately 100 countries and was not changed prior to publication.
The IPCC report (Volume II) also summarizes the scientific knowledge relating to the impacts of climate change on numerous human and ecological systems, including human health. The chapter on human health recognizes that climate change increases the risk of mortality because of heat waves and reduces the risk of mortality from cold weather. More people live in hot climates than in cold climates, so climate change is likely to increase mortality. Adaptation options such as air-conditioning are also considered, but only a small fraction of the residents of hot climates have an income sufficiently high to "plug in air-conditioning," as Mr. Corcoran recommends, and doing so would probably aggravate climate change and the other damages it causes.
The reinsurance industry, whose profitability depends on careful assessment of risks, does not share Mr. Corcoran's conclusion concerning the risks of climate change. The industry believes that climate change is a contributing factor to the rapid rise in losses from weather-related disasters over the past decade. The implications of climate change for the property insurance industry are discussed in Chapter 17 (Volume II) of the IPCC report.
The effects of climate change, if they are realized, will persist for several hundred years. All of the scientific studies of the effects on a global scale suggest net damage after taking account of beneficial impacts, such as reduced mortality in cold climates and the CO2 fertilization effect for crops, and adaptation options, such as building sea walls and increased use of air-conditioning.
One needs only accept that there is a possibility of damage from climate change to justify action. The risk of an automobile accident is sufficient justification to buy insurance. The same rationale applies here. Perhaps humans are not causing the climate to change, and perhaps the effects will be trivial if the climate does change, but there is enough evidence to the contrary that some action is warranted.
Again, representatives of almost 100 countries unanimously agreed with this conclusion when they adopted the summary of Volume III of the IPCC report, which states that "the literature indicates that significant 'no regrets' opportunities are available in most countries and that the risk of aggregate net damage due to climate change, consideration of risk aversion, and application of the precautionary principle provide rationales for action beyond no regrets." No regrets measures are actions that yield environmental or economic benefits sufficient to justify the cost, regardless of their contribution to climate change mitigation.
Mr. Corcoran engages in the scaremongering tactics he attributes to others when he quotes the Leipzig scientists as concluding that "carbon taxes and other drastic controls would be ill advised, premature, wrought with economic danger and likely to be counterproductive." A carbon tax can be a no regrets measure. Numerous economic studies have shown that if a carbon tax is implemented and the revenue is recycled by reducing payroll taxes paid by employers or taxes on investment, the result can be economic growth and lower emissions of greenhouse gases. Of course, not all recycling options produce both economic growth and environmental benefits, but it appears to be possible.
Given that action is justified but that uncertainties relating to climate change remain, the economists participating in the IPCC conclude that a portfolio approach similar to that used by investment fund managers is a sound basis for implementing climate change policy. Specifically, Volume III concludes that "a prudent way to deal with climate change is through a portfolio of actions aimed at mitigation, adaptation and improvement of knowledge. The appropriate portfolio will differ for each country. The challenge is not to find the best policy today for the next 100 years, but to select a prudent strategy and to adjust it over time in the light of new information."

World community finally bulldozes global-warming naysayers aside: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: George Bush first promised to use the White House's power to cut carbon dioxide emissions during the 1988 election campaign, but he ran for cover when U.S. industries complained that it might cost them profits. For eight years, official U.S. policy has been that there should be only ``voluntary'' controls (i.e. none). Now, however, it is Bill Clinton's re-election campaign, and there just might be some votes in trying to save the world. So on July 17, at the International Climate Change Conference in Geneva, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Timothy Wirth announced a dramatic reversal of American policy. ``Our approach here is to have a straight target that everybody has to sign up to,'' said Wirth. ``What we want is a binding target for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that is agreed internationally.'' Though it will not produce any immediate results, this is probably the most important event of the year.

Full text: The ``White House effect' has finally been applied to the greenhouse effect. If you're planning to be alive much past 2010, or have children who will be, this is very good news.
George Bush first promised to use the White House's power to cut carbon dioxide emissions during the 1988 election campaign, but he ran for cover when U.S. industries complained that it might cost them profits. For eight years, official U.S. policy has been that there should be only ``voluntary'' controls (i.e. none).
Now, however, it is Bill Clinton's re-election campaign, and there just might be some votes in trying to save the world. So on July 17, at the International Climate Change Conference in Geneva, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Timothy Wirth announced a dramatic reversal of American policy.
``Our approach here is to have a straight target that everybody has to sign up to,'' said Wirth. ``What we want is a binding target for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that is agreed internationally.'' Though it will not produce any immediate results, this is probably the most important event of the year.
The conference ended without agreeing on what the target should be. Ten percent cuts by 2005? Twenty percent cuts? That will be decided in the next eight months, on the basis of how much emissions must be cut to hold the global temperature rise to 2 degrees C. (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).
That target then gets approved by the next conference in Japan a year from now, but it will be several more years before the major industrial countries ratify the accord and work out policies for applying it on their own territory.
A major corner has been turned: the principle of universal, mandatory cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions has been accepted by the international community.
Those who doubt the reality of global warming are entitled to try to make their case. But it's obvious they are those who fear they will lose money if greenhouse-gas emissions are restricted.
The Naysayer with the highest profile is Don Pearlman, an American lawyer. At every international political conference and scientific meeting on climate change for the past several years, his lobbyists have been present to challenge the wording of documents and obscure the clarity of the scientists' conclusions. Pearlman will not say whom he works for, but he is usually seen in the company of Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti delegates.
Those countries oppose greenhouse-gas restrictions because the market for fossil fuels will go into a steep decline if the industrial countries start cutting carbon-dioxide emissions, and then who will buy their oil? (Australia, a major coal exporter, was also allied with the Naysayers at Geneva.)
But the most effective naysayer is the Global Climate Coalition. It sounds like an environment-friendly group, but its membership includes the ``Seven Sisters'' (oil giants Shell, Texaco, Exxon, British Petroleum, Amoco, Chevron and Mobil), plus Ford and General Motors, Dow Chemicals and Union Carbide, the Air Transport Association, and other big energy users like the aluminum industry.
With apparently limitless funds at its disposal, the GCC has worked to convince the world's media and the U.S. Congress that global warning is an ``open question'' about which it would be premature to actually do anything. Its strategy is sabotage, confusion and delay.
So what has finally defeated the best efforts of these powerful, well-funded lobbyists? One word: fear.
Fear that more severe storms caused by global warming may gut the insurance industry. Pay-outs for storm damage in 1990-95 already total $48 billion, three times the figure for all of the 80s.
Fear that melting polar ice and rising sea levels may drown some entire small countries that are made up of low-lying islands.
Fear, above all, that it's already too late to stop global temperatures from going up a couple of degrees, and that only urgent action will forestall even more drastic changes.
One study predicts that in 30 years southern England will be warm enough for malaria-bearing mosquitoes, Paris will have the climate of the south of France -- and Spain will be mostly a desert.
So the 150 countries at Geneva have bulldozed the naysayers aside and started down the long, hard road to controlling greenhouse-gas emissions. The economic and social implications will ultimately be huge, though some years will pass before people begin to feel a direct impact on their lifestyles.
But at last we have agreement in principle to try. That is worth a lot.

Full text: The United States apparently is ready to take the threat of global warming seriously. That's welcome news. Enough information now is available to show that those who warn about global warming aren't "Chicken Littles" shouting that the sky is falling.
If humankind ignores the problem, it does so at its peril.
As the world's largest industrial nation, the United States is responsible for many of the greenhouse gases that spew into the atmosphere.
It is also a nation that has made great strides already in cutting air pollution. It has the technical expertise and economic wherewithal to develop the technologies to address the problem of global warming.
These are technologies that can be exported, helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, while at the same time halping America's international trade.
Last week in Geneva, at a conference on global warming attended by representatives from 150 nations, the United States committed itself to legally-binding reductions in the production of greenhouse gases, chief of which is carbon dioxide caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The extent of the cuts will be specified within the next year and a half, after completion of an extensive economic analysis.
Previously, U.S. environmental policy called for a voluntary approach to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.
A consensus has developed among the world's scientists that global warming is a very real problem. Data compiled by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggest the Earth's temperature has risen nearly 1 degree in the last 100 years, and that in the next century it could rise from 2 to 6 degrees.
Certain vested interests, such as oil and auto producers, dispute the extent of the problem and warn that mandating substantial cuts in greenhouse emissions will adversely affect the economy, raising prices and costing millions of American their jobs.
Similar concerns were voiced when the nation embarked on efforts a generation ago to improve air and water quality. Some industries suffered, and some people lost their jobs. But today the United States has the most innovative, vibrant economy on Earth. Unemployment is low, and the nation is looked upon as the job-creating wonder of the world.
An all-out assault on greenhouse gases no doubt will result in technological advances, more efficient use of energy and a redirection of capital into products that today aren't even on the drawing board. All of this could help the economy rather than hurt it.
Global warming, on the other hand, would cause more violent weather patterns, severe droughts in some areas, and a rising sea level as the polar caps melt. A sea-level rise could displace hundreds of millions of coastal residents throughout the world.
The negative economic consequences of global warming on agriculture, real estate, insurance, tourism and other industries would be enormous.
Combating global warming will be expensive, but it will be a pittance compared to the expense if humankind does nothing.

SUNDAY READER - Why governments finally set to tackle global warming

Abstract: The Naysayer with the highest profile is American lawyer Don Pearlman. At every international political conference and scientific meeting on climate change for the past several years, his lobbyists have been present to challenge the wording of documents and obscure scientists' conclusions. Pearlman will not say whom he works for, but he is usually seen in the company of Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti delegates. Pearlman and the fossil-fuel exporters were not nearly as effective as the misleadingly named Global Climate Coalition. It sounds like an environment-friendly group, but its member-ship includes the "Seven Sisters" (oil giants Shell, Texaco, Exxon, British Petroleum, Amoco, Chevron and Mobil), plus Ford and General Motors, Dow Chemicals, Union Carbide, the Air Transport Association, and other big energy users. Fear that more severe storms caused by global warming may gut the insurance industry. Pay-outs for storm damage in 1990-95 already total $48 billion, three times the figure for all of the '80s, and 58 international insurance companies went to Geneva to demand "early substantial reductions" in greenhouse-gas emissions.

Full text: - by Gwynne Dyer The "White House effect" has finally been applied to the greenhouse effect. If you plan to be alive much past 2010, or have children who will be, this is very good news.
George Bush first promised to use the White House's power to cut carbon dioxide emissions in the 1988 election campaign, but he ran for cover when U.S. industries complained that it might cost them profits. For eight years, official U.S. policy has been that there should be only "voluntary" controls (i.e., none).
Now, however, it is Bill Clinton's re-election campaign, and there just might be some votes in trying to save the world. So on July 17, at the International Climate Change Conference in Geneva, U.S.
Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Timothy Wirth announced a dramatic reversal of American policy.
"Our approach here is to have a straight target that everybody has to sign up to," said Wirth. "What we want is a binding target for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that is agreed internationally." Though it will not produce any immediate results, this is probably the most important event of the year.
The International Climate Change Conference just wound up without agreeing on what the target should be. Ten per cent cuts by 2005?Twenty per cent cuts? That will be decided in the next eight months, on the basis of how much emissions must be cut to hold the global temperature rise to two degrees Celsius.
Dancing in the streets would therefore be premature, but a major corner has been turned: the principle of universal, mandatory cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions has been accepted by the inter-national community. The forces of darkness have been defeated.
Eileen Clausson, who led the American delegation at the climate conference, was quite blunt about who they are and how they operate: "They are a very strong group of people who muddy the science. We call them the Naysayers."
The Naysayer with the highest profile is American lawyer Don Pearlman. At every international political conference and scientific meeting on climate change for the past several years, his lobbyists have been present to challenge the wording of documents and obscure scientists' conclusions. Pearlman will not say whom he works for, but he is usually seen in the company of Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti delegates.
But Pearlman and the fossil-fuel exporters were not nearly as effective as the misleadingly named Global Climate Coalition. It sounds like an environment-friendly group, but its member-ship includes the "Seven Sisters" (oil giants Shell, Texaco, Exxon, British Petroleum, Amoco, Chevron and Mobil), plus Ford and General Motors, Dow Chemicals, Union Carbide, the Air Transport Association, and other big energy users.
With apparently limitless funds at its disposal, the GCC has worked to convince the world's media and the U.S. Congress that global warning is an "open question" about which it would be premature to actually do any-thing. It publicizes the findings of scientists who deny the validity of the evidence for global warming - what the World Wide Fund for Nature calls "junk science paid for by the oil and coal lobbies." Its strategy is sabotage, confusion and delay.
So what finally defeated the best efforts of these powerful, well- funded lobbyists? Fear.
Fear that more severe storms caused by global warming may gut the insurance industry. Pay-outs for storm damage in 1990-95 already total $48 billion, three times the figure for all of the '80s, and 58 international insurance companies went to Geneva to demand "early substantial reductions" in greenhouse-gas emissions.
Fear that melting polar ice and rising sea levels may drown some entire small countries that are made up of low-lying islands, like Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Maldives and Tonga, and swamp big chunks of densely populated countries like Bangladesh and the Netherlands.
Fear, above all, that it's already too late to stop global tempera-tures from going up a couple of degrees, and that only urgent action will forestall even more drastic changes. Two weeks before the Geneva conference, British Environment Secretary John Gummer announced the results of a study predicting that in 30 years, southern England will be warm enough for malaria-bearing mosquitoes and Spain will be mostly a desert.
So 150 countries have bulldozed the Naysayers aside and started down the long, hard road to controlling greenhouse-gas emissions. The economic and social implications will ultim-ately be huge, though years will pass before people feel a direct impact on their lifestyles. And of course, nobody can guarantee that it's not already too late.

Abstract: BOULDER - University of Denver professor and Boulder writer Judith Jacobsen has been calmly sounding the alarm for years: The United States is growing too fast, straining its ability to deal with the spinoffs of growth - pollution, congestion, urban sprawl and the consumption of natural resources like land and water. The report concludes that the United States must slow its population growth promptly and reduce wasteful consumption - or risk a declining quality of life for future generations.

Full text: BOULDER - University of Denver professor and Boulder writer Judith Jacobsen has been calmly sounding the alarm for years:
The United States is growing too fast, straining its ability to deal with the spinoffs of growth - pollution, congestion, urban sprawl and the consumption of natural resources like land and water.
Increasing population, she says, is not the path to prosperity.
To some, it's not a popular position.
But to Jacobsen, it's the gospel, and she's been preaching it in classrooms, at conferences and in research papers for more than a decade.
Now, Jacobsen's work has made her a small part of history.
Two weeks ago, a presidential task force she co-chaired released a report that calls for curbing U.S. population growth. It was the first time that a presidential council has made such a recommendation.
The report concludes that the United States must slow its population growth promptly and reduce wasteful consumption - or risk a declining quality of life for future generations.
But most significant to Jacobsen, the conclusion came not only from academics and environmentalists, but from corporate executives and economic thinkers.
"This statement represents the strongest, deepest, broadest consensus - at the highest level - that we should stabilize U.S. population growth," Jacobsen said.
What impact the report will have isn't clear. Some say it is likely to become part of President Clinton's platform, as he continues to court the votes of environmentalists.
Nothing in the report carries the weight of law. Clinton can ignore any of its recommendations.
But Jacobsen, 43, believes the whole of the report is more important than each of its recommendations. Taken as a single document, she said, it can be used to pressure politicians and policymakers by showing there's a broad-based concern about the population's impact on the environment.
Indeed, at its current growth rate of 1 percent, the United States - now with a population of 263 million - adds 3 million people a year. That means the country likely will grow to more than 350 million by 2030. That's the equivalent of adding another Connecticut every year, or another California every decade.
Advocates of population stabilization say that at some point - nobody knows when, and Jacobsen says it's pointless to guess - the stress of so many people on water, air and earth will send quality of life into a tailspin.
Jacobsen, though, operates under the belief that humans, individually and as a society, can prevent that from happening.
She has toiled on the subject as a public policy professor, speaker, writer and consultant since the early 1980s. Usually working out of her home in a quiet Boulder neighborhood, she has taken a scholarly, methodical approach to an issue that many environmentalists see as the granddaddy of ecological crises.
Her concern runs deep - globally and locally. She's written about population controls in Singapore, but also worries about the effect of growth on Colorado, where the population is 3.8 million and the 2 percent-a-year growth exceeds the national rate.
While some may consider her cause controversial, she avoids controversy. She has no children, but never preaches to friends with three or four. She prefers encouraging broad, societal change over one-on-one confrontations with those who oppose her. She leaves that to her husband, a scientist who enjoys debating his own specialty, climate change.
Above all, she is patient and a political realist, a surprising makeup for someone who has a clear view of an ugly future if the population keeps rising.
"If you labor in the field, you have to appreciate incremental change," Jacobsen said.
And she sees it. Though population stabilization remains controversial with some religious groups, Catholics in particular. Jacobsen said that more and more, ordinary people and economists appear to be backing off the belief that all growth is good.
"Regular people have instincts that tell them there are limits," she said. The effects of population growth also stare many people right in the face, she said. "Certainly people in California and Florida are seeing it, people who see local growth eat up the places they love."
In 1968, author Paul R. Ehrlich was widely ridiculed for his book, "The Population Bomb," in which he predicted famines and resource depletion if the human race didn't stop growing. Many people, particularly economists, thought the notion absurd.
Jacobsen, however, says there are plenty of people out there who believe technology will save us from ourselves, providing enough food, for example, for a much larger population. Then there's a segment who she says simply denies that people can be creating environmental problems.
"They say, `We as humans can't be making that kind of dent. . . . The Earth is huge, we simply aren't going to run out of things.' "
Claudine Schneider, a Boulder-based board member of the Washington, D.C.-based Competitiveness Policy Council - a bipartisan group that focuses on policies to improve America's economic competitiveness - agrees that the days of economists blindly preaching the worship of growth are "as passe as a couple of dinosaurs."
She said economists now take a much broader view of growth, incorporating the impact of cars and congestion on quality of life, for example.
Jacobsen isn't a doomsayer. She can spout statistics about population and food supply and water pollution. But she has spent much of her career studying how to curb population growth without using draconian methods like those in China, where family size is regulated.
The most critical solutions are represented in the president's council report and hardly amount to a radical approach, she says.
"There's this phobia about achieving zero population growth," she said. "We're not talking about pushing old folks off of icebergs."
Much of the problem, the council concluded, could be dealt with by confronting the simple fact that every year, almost 60 percent of all pregnancies and 40 percent of all births in the United States are either mistimed or unwanted.
To counter that, the council recommends improving education about - and access to - contraceptives, increasing reproductive education and services for teen-agers and requiring insurance companies and Medicaid to pay for more birth control and family planning options.
But Jacobsen also supports - and the president's council endorsed - what many might consider more radical measures: eliminating subsidies and tax breaks for corporations that sell natural resources, like timber and minerals.
Though it wouldn't have a direct impact on population growth, it would make many goods more expensive, reflecting what the report calls the "true price" of the items. Experts reason it would reduce consumption of natural resources.
Jacobsen acknowledges that such a task is nearly equivalent to "restructuring the entire American economy," and that she doesn't see any quick social change on that scale.
Nevertheless, she remains optimistic. She believes Americans want quality of life, don't want to see unwanted babies born, and see the sense in focusing on "prevention rather than cure."
But she also fears that the country might wait until it's too late to take a potential population crisis seriously - that facts and numbers won't stir people to action.
"The sheer logic of science doesn't seem to move people much," she said. "Crisis is more powerful than logic."

Reaping what we sow: What's Going Wrong? Crazy weather may be more of an act of Man than an act of God: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: True, the flooding across the Saguenay, Charlevoix and North Shore was unprecedented for the region. But on a broader scale, such sudden extremes of weather appear to be growing more common than at any time in history. ``Certainly in North America,'' says Henry Hengeveld, senior adviser on climate change at Environment Canada, ``there has been a trend toward extreme weather events. I would caution, however, that it is very difficult to ascribe the Saguenay events to a particular cause.'' In truth, climates have always changed -- and those changes have often had an impact on human societies. When the Vikings sailed forth from Norway to settle in Iceland, Greenland and North America, they were blessed by a rare spell of warmth in the North Atlantic. Once that period ended and the climate cooled, the Vikings could no longer sustain life in Newfoundland and Greenland.

Full text: An act of God. The power of Mother Nature.
Faced with the devastation of eastern Quebec, eye-witnesses took refuge in stock phrases.
The storm that battered the Saguenay was, indeed, remarkable. More than 27 centimetres (10.6 inches) of rain fell in a weekend -- three times the normal amount for the entire month of July. The wetness of the soil and the fullness of local reservoirs heightened the calamity.
But if you take a step back from those images of sunken houses and collapsed highways, of destitute families and flooded towns, a troubling larger picture begins to emerge.
True, the flooding across the Saguenay, Charlevoix and North Shore was unprecedented for the region. But on a broader scale, such sudden extremes of weather appear to be growing more common than at any time in history.
For Quebecers, the July inundation will probably go down as ``the flood of the century.'' Similar words have been used to describe the hail storms that have pounded Calgary this summer and the flooding that laid waste to parts of Southern Alberta in 1995, to the southeastern U.S. in 1994 and to a vast swath of the Mississippi basin in 1993.
Pity the Dutch: they endured a ``flood of the century'' in December 1993; another in February 1995.
``Certainly in North America,'' says Henry Hengeveld, senior adviser on climate change at Environment Canada, ``there has been a trend toward extreme weather events. I would caution, however, that it is very difficult to ascribe the Saguenay events to a particular cause.''
Climatologists are cautious folk. Not for them the day-by-day perturbations of weather; they take a loftier view. They know the world to be infinitely complex. In the face of ``natural variability,'' unnatural patterns are never easy to prove.
``But the consensus,'' says Chris Flavin, research vice-president at the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, D.C., ``is that we are already outside the realm of natural variability. Most scientists think we're already witnessing the beginning of climate change.''
In truth, climates have always changed -- and those changes have often had an impact on human societies. When the Vikings sailed forth from Norway to settle in Iceland, Greenland and North America, they were blessed by a rare spell of warmth in the North Atlantic. Once that period ended and the climate cooled, the Vikings could no longer sustain life in Newfoundland and Greenland.
But if Flavin is right, we're on the threshold of something new: an age when our climate is no longer purely ``natural'' -- when ``acts of God'' might be blamed on the behavior of human beings.
Flavin believes -- along with the scientists who wrote a 1993 assessment for the International Panel on Climate Change -- that global warming is no longer just an interesting theory, it is reality. And this time, unlike other periods in history, the climate change is partly man-made, a result of the emission of ``greenhouse'' gases.
The evidence is compelling: since 1860, the 10 warmest years on record have been among the last 15. Greenhouse gases are taking their toll: between 1959 and 1994, concentrations of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere rose by 14 per cent. Most strikingly, the world's weather is starting to misbehave exactly as the computer models predicted.
Which takes us back to the ravaged streets of Chicoutimi and Jonquiere. Because, in Hengeveld's words, ``with warmer climates, we should see -- especially in summer --more intense rainfall.''
``The kind of flooding events we've seen in Quebec are good indications of what we should see more frequently in the future if the models are correct. They're a reminder that the effect of climate change on human society and ecosystems will be felt most painfully in extreme events, rather than by gradual change.''
To most Canadians, the advent of global warming might seem welcome. But, as Hengeveld reminds us, warming means something more than just earlier springs and slushier winters; it also means more brutal, unpredictable storms.
``Climate will not just change in future; it is doing so today.'' The words are not those of some environmentalist, but of the major insurer, Swiss Re, in a 1994 report called Global Warming: Element of Risk. ``The danger of unmanageable extreme weather situations is . . . not a future threat but already an acute one.''
It has taken the insurance business to sound the alarm bells about the impact of global warming. The reason is simple: climate change threatens to bankrupt the industry.
The Swiss Re report posits scenarios in which, as a result of disastrous weather events, ``the urban system will collapse within days. . . . It is not uncertain that, when major cities are affected, extreme weather situations will cause inconceivably high damage, in the range of one or more per cent of the gross national product, with unmanageable consequences.
``One possible effect of global climatic change is that cities might have to be abandoned, just as human settlements were in the past. Nobody knows how to cope with such an eventuality.''
Fortunately, all this remains in the realm of the hypothetical. Nobody can say for sure that storms in eastern Quebec arose from anything other than freak weather and bad luck.
And on the mere existence of global warming, there are skeptics.
One such is Gerald Bell, a meteorologist who works for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Bell points out that natural forces, such as the Pacific phenomenon of El Nino and the ``North Atlantic oscillation,'' exert the greatest power over our daily weather.
``Global temperatures have increased, but that still could be just natural variation. The issue is not closed at all.
``There are so many other things of such greater magnitude and larger time-scales, how can you look at anything and call it an effect of global warming?''
``What we're talking about,'' Hengeveld responds, ``is large-scale global change that also begins to affect variability on a shorter scale. It's important to distinguish between climate and weather. Remember, if the base levels change as a result of global warming, then the fluctuations will change as well. And if our models are correct, we should see fewer low-level events (such as drizzle in summer) and more intense events (such as thunderstorms).''
Even the winter-warming effects of the El Nino current in the Pacific may be linked to global warming. After a giant El Nino in 1981-'82 and a moderate one in 1986-'87, the Pacific experienced a kind of small-scale, four-year El Nino between 1991 and 1995.
Aside from global warming, other factors link the Saguenay inundation with recent floods around the world. At the same time as all hell was breaking loose in Chicoutimi and La Baie, large parts of Italy, Bangladesh and southern China were also under water.
After the waters had begun to recede in the Saguenay, some residents suggested Quebec's system of managing dams played a part in the disaster.
This week, provincial Environment Minister David Cliche rejected the charge -- though he admitted he will now consider forcing privately owned dams to meet government inspections.
Here again, there are links to a much broader pattern: one in which human interference with nature comes with a high price-tag. Jean Vallee, a professor of geotechnical engineering at the Universite du Quebec a Chicoutimi, has called part of the Saguenay flooding ``nature's revenge.''
There are good short-term economic reasons for deforestation, soil depletion, urbanization, dam-building and the like. In the long run, though, these actions can lead to environmental problems.
``Removal of wetlands really does cause problems,'' noted Jim O'Brien of Florida State University. Along the Mississippi, people who got flooded were living in the flood plain, where they shouldn't have been in the first place. ``Rich farming land that's in river bottoms has been put there by previous floods.''
The Swiss Re report is unequivocal: ``The 1993 flood was due to the creation in the Mississippi River of a man-made system which was exposed to widespread damage or even total destruction from the effect of heavy rainfall.''
After the ravages in northwestern Europe 18 months ago, many people expressed a similar sentiment. ``We've been raping the land,'' said Klaudia Martini, environment minister in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. ``We've got to change that.''
The European floods, it's generally accepted, were not just the product of heavy winter rainfall. They also resulted from the way mechanized agriculture had reduced the ground's capacity to absorb water -- coupled with engineering work that had straightened rivers for ease of transportation.
In Bangladesh, likewise, annual flooding of the Ganges river system has long been a fact of life. But the new brutality of those floods stems from human action: deforestation in the Himalayas, and manipulation of the Ganges by upstream dams in India.
``Over the next 40 years,'' warns Constance Hunt, freshwater-ecosystems specialist for the World Wildlife Fund in Washington, D.C., ``humanity's ability to appropriate fresh water is expected to grow by 10 per cent. Yet our population is expected to grow by 45 per cent.
``As river systems are engineered and as populations grow, there are two direct consequences: deforestation, and an increase in soil erosion. In short, the landscape is losing its ability to absorb precipitation.''
We can't be certain that global climate change is causing extreme events, Hunt says.
``But we do know there are things we can do as a society to lessen their impact. We can improve soil and water conservation. We can restore wetlands. We can manage flood plains in non-structural ways, rather than channelling and enclosing our rivers. And we can improve storm-water management in urban areas.''
Acts of God or otherwise, days of tremendous rainfall will always be with us.
But the destruction caused by floods is now, in part, our own responsibility.

ACT OF GOD OR MAN?; Sudden extremes of weather like the floods in the Saguenay are becoming more common around the world, in part because of global warming: [FINAL Edition]

Full text:   `An act of God." "The power of Mother Nature." Faced with the terrible devastation of eastern Quebec, eye-witnesses took refuge in stock phrases like that.
The storm that battered the Saguenay was, indeed, remarkable. More than 27 centimetres (10.6 inches) of rain fell there last weekend - three times the normal amount for the entire month of July. The wetness of the soil and the fullness of local reservoirs heightened the calamity.
But if you take a step back from those images of sunken houses and collapsed highways, of destitute families and flooded towns, a troubling larger picture begins to emerge. True, the flooding across the Saguenay, Charlevoix and North Shore was unprecedented for the region. But on a broader scale, such sudden extremes of weather appear to be growing more common than at any time in history.
For Quebecers, last weekend's inundation will probably go down as "the flood of the century." The same words have been used to describe the flooding that laid waste to Alberta in 1995, to the southeastern U.S. in 1994 and to a vast swath of the Mississippi basin in 1993. Pity the Dutch: they endured a "flood of the century" in December 1993, followed by another in February 1995.
"Certainly in North America," said Henry Hengeveld, senior adviser on climate change at Environment Canada, "there has been a trend toward extreme weather events. I would caution, however, that it is very difficult to ascribe the Saguenay events to a particular cause."
Climatologists are cautious folk. Not for them the day-by-day perturbations of weather; they take a loftier view. They know the world to be infinitely complex. In the face of "natural variability," unnatural patterns are never easy to prove.
"But the consensus," said Chris Flavin, vice-president for research at the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, D.C., "is that we are already outside the realm of natural variability. Most scientists think we're already witnessing the beginning of climate change."
In truth, climates have always changed - and those changes have often had an impact on human societies. When the Vikings sailed forth from Norway to settle in Iceland, Greenland and North America a thousand years ago, they were blessed by a rare spell of warmth in the North Atlantic. Once that period ended and the climate cooled off, the Vikings could no longer sustain life in Newfoundland and Greenland.
But if Flavin is right, we're standing on the threshold of something new: an age when our climate is no longer purely "natural." An age when "acts of God" might be blamed, at least in part, on the behavior of human beings.
Flavin believes - along with the eminent scientists who wrote a 1993 assessment for the International Panel on Climate Change - that global warming is no longer just an interesting theory; global warming is a reality. And this time, unlike other periods in history, the climate change is partly man-made, a result of the emission of ``greenhouse'' gases.
In this wet and windy summer, the notion of global warming might be hard for Montrealers to digest. But the evidence is clear: since 1860, the 10 warmest years on record have been among the last 15. Greenhouse gases are taking their toll: between 1959 and 1994, concentrations of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere rose by 14 per cent. And most strikingly, perhaps, the world's weather is starting to misbehave exactly as the computer models predict.
Which takes us back to the ravaged streets of Chicoutimi and Jonquiere. Because, in Hengeveld's words, "with warmer climates, we should see - especially in summer - more intense rainfall events.''
"The kind of flooding events we've seen in Quebec are good indications of what we should see more frequently in the future - if the models are correct. They're a reminder that the effect of climate change on human society and ecosystems will be felt most painfully in extreme events, rather than by gradual change."
To most Canadians, the advent of global warming might seem a welcome prospect. But as Hengeveld reminds us, global warming means something more than just earlier springs and slushier winters; it also means an increase in the number of brutal, unpredictable storms.
n n n
"Climate will not just change in future; it is doing so today." The words are not those of some frightened environmentalist, but of the giant Swiss Re insurance company, in a 1994 report entitled Global Warming: Element of Risk. "The danger of unmanageable extreme weather situations is therefore not a future threat but already an acute one."
It has taken the insurance business (one of the largest in the world) to sound the alarm bells about the impact of global warming. The reason is simple: climate change threatens to bankrupt the industry.
The Swiss Re report posits scenarios in which, as a result of disastrous weather events, "the urban system will collapse within days. It is not uncertain that, when major cities are affected, extreme weather situations will cause inconceivably high damage, in the range of one or more per cent of the gross national product, with unmanageable consequences.
"One possible effect of global climatic change is that cities might have to be abandoned, just as human settlements were in the past. Nobody knows how to cope with such an eventuality."
Fortunately, all this remains in the realm of the hypothetical. Nobody can say for sure that the storms in eastern Quebec arose from anything other than freak weather and bad luck. On the mere existence of global warming, there are still a few skeptics - though Flavin of the Worldwatch Institute likens them to the handful of doctors who persist in denying a causal link between smoking and cancer.
One of the skeptics is Gerald Bell, a meteorologist who works for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Bell points out that natural forces, such as the Pacific phenomenon of El Nino and the "North Atlantic oscillation," exert the greatest power over our daily weather:
"Global temperatures have increased, but that still could be just natural variation. The issue is not closed at all. My skepticism is, there are so many other things of such greater magnitude and larger time-scales, how can you look at anything and call it an effect of global warming?"
"What we're talking about," Hengeveld responds, "is large-scale global change that also begins to affect variability on a shorter scale. It's important to distinguish between climate and weather. Remember, if the base levels change as a result of global warming, then the fluctuations will change as well. And if our models are correct, we should see fewer low-level events (such as drizzle in summer) and more intense events (such as thunderstorms)."
Even El Nino might be linked to global warming. After a giant El Nino in 1981-82 and a moderate one in 1986-87, the Pacific experienced a kind of small-scale, four-year El Nino between 1991 and 1995. One way to think about El Nino is as a vehicle through which the tropics release heat energy by bringing it to the ocean's surface - in which case, global climate change might well have contributed to El Nino's odd activity.
n n n
Aside from global warming, other factors link the Saguenay inundation with recent floods around the world. At the same time as all hell was breaking loose in Chicoutimi and La Baie, large chunks of Rome, Bangladesh and southern China were also under water.
After the waters had begun to recede in the Saguenay, some local residents suggested that Quebec's system of managing dams played a part in the disaster. This week, provincial Environment Minister David Cliche rejected the charge - though he admitted that he will now consider forcing privately owned dams to meet government inspections. In eastern Quebec, as in many other places, dams exist for two purposes: water storage and flood prevention. At moments of extreme weather, those aims might be incompatible.
Here again, there are links to a much broader pattern: one in which human interference with nature comes with a high price tag. Jean Vallee, a professor of geotechnical engineering at the Universite du Quebec a Chicoutimi, has called part of the Saguenay flooding "nature's revenge."
There are good short-term economic reasons for deforestation, soil depletion, urbanization, dam-building and other such activities. In the long run, though, these actions can lead to massive environmental problems.
"Removal of wetlands really does cause problems," noted Jim O'Brien of Florida State University. In the case of the Mississippi, the people who got flooded were living in the flood plain, where they shouldn't have been in the first place. Don't forget that the rich farming land that's in river bottoms has been put there by previous floods."
The Swiss Re report on global warming is unequivocal: "The 1993 flood was due to the creation in the Mississippi River of a man- made system which was exposed to widespread damage or even total destruction from the effect of heavy rainfall."
After the ravages in northwestern Europe 18 months ago, many people expressed a similar sentiment. "We've been raping the land," said Klaudia Martini, environment minister in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, "and we've got to change that."
The European floods, it's generally accepted, were not just the product of heavy winter rainfall. They also resulted from the way in which mechanized agriculture had reduced the ground's capacity to absorb water - coupled with engineering work that had straightened and corseted rivers for ease of transportation. In that respect, the Ha! Ha! River was imitating the Rhine last weekend.
In Bangladesh, likewise, annual flooding of the Ganges river system has long been a fact of life. But the new brutality of those floods stems from human action: the deforestation of the Himalayas, along with the attempted manipulation of the Ganges by upstream dams in India.
"Over the next 40 years," warned Constance Hunt, freshwater- ecosystems specialist for the World Wildlife Fund in Washington, D.C., "humanity's ability to appropriate fresh water is expected to grow by 10 per cent. Yet our population is expected to grow by 45 per cent.
"As river systems are engineered and as populations grow, there are two direct consequences: deforestation, and an increase in soil erosion. In short, the landscape is losing its ability to absorb precipitation."
Despite the impressive weight of evidence, Hunt says, we can't be certain that global climate change is causing extreme events like the Saguenay flood.
"But we do know there are things we can do as a society to lessen their impact. We can improve soil and water conservation. We can restore wetlands. We can manage flood plains in non-structural ways, rather than channellizing and enclosing our rivers. And we can improve storm-water management in urban areas."
Acts of God or otherwise, days of tremendous rainfall will always be with us. But the destruction caused by floods is now, in part, our own responsibility.

COVER STORY Weather talk becoming urgent
Insurance firms warn of climate change
Saturday, July 27, 1996
The Globe and Mail
INSURANCE executives are not known for extreme statements, and Ivo Knoepfel is no exception.
His words on the telephone from Zurich are measured and carefully chosen. But the message is one of urgency. The world, Mr. Knoepfel says, must begin now to curb the human contribution to global climate change.
"It is a truly global problem," said the climate-change adviser at Swiss Reinsurance Co., one of a handful of firms that sell catastrophe coverage to smaller insurance companies. "And it's clear that society as a whole, and also business, needs some signals to start reacting and start changing some of its activities.
"If we do not get some political will, or some signals that something has to be done, it will be difficult for businesses to begin to adapt."
That Mr. Knoepfel's job exists at all points to how seriously some of the most conservative companies in the world are taking the prospect of a warming of the earth's climate.
This week, there was renewed talk of global warming as floods caused by heavy rains killed 1,500 people in China, 245 in India and Bangladesh and 10 in Quebec.
It's virtually impossible to blame global warming directly for such specific tragedies. But there is evidence that hurricanes, typhoons, droughts and floods are becoming more frequent. From 1963 to 1992 the number of floods causing major damage increased from two every five years to 24, and the number causing at least 100 deaths more than doubled, United Nations figures show. There were smaller but significant increases in serious tropical storms and droughts.
And soaring losses from climate-related disasters, coupled with persuasion from environmentalists, are turning some insurers a deeper shade of green.
At international talks in Geneva earlier this month, 57 European insurance firms issued a statement saying they believe that man-made climate change will probably increase the frequency of storms and drought.
They urged delegates from more than 150 countries to achieve "early, substantial reductions" of carbon emissions -- the so-called "greenhouse gases" that many scientists believe are affecting temperature and rainfall. Toward the end of the Geneva talks, the United States abruptly changed its position and called for legally binding emissions limits.
And in the end, the delegates agreed to prepare a schedule of mandatory limits to be implemented after the year 2000. It will be submitted for final approval at another meeting in Kyoto in December, 1997.
Depending on how strict the limits are, they could speed changes in the way Canadian industry operates -- and they might even make it more expensive to own a car or build a house.
Canada and other countries have so far relied largely on voluntary programs to back up a commitment to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. More than 500 Canadian firms have signed up for a voluntary-reduction plan.
Nevertheless, most countries are spewing more carbon than ever into the atmosphere. A widely cited estimate is that emissions levels in Canada will actually rise 13 per cent during the decade.
Federal officials say the most likely post-Kyoto outcome is a system of permits for carbon emissions that could be bought, sold or traded among companies.
But if the international rules are strict enough, they could also lead federal and provincial governments to further tighten controls on car and truck emissions or to require that houses be more energy-efficient.
That would please environmentalists, who say Canada is unusually vulnerable to climate change because of the importance of forest resources and the fragility of its Arctic environment.
But it would worry businesses, who fear that international rules will limit emissions on a per-capita basis, unduly penalizing a country such as Canada that is large, cold, rich and sparsely populated.
Whatever the outcome, federal officials say Canadians need a wake-up call on climate change. They want the public to be more aware of its potential effects and of the politics surrounding the issue.
"I don't think Canadians have really recognized this as an environmental problem," said Ann MacKenzie, director of global air issues at Environment Canada. "There's too much thinking that it's in the distant future . . . We have a fair ways to go."
It's not just the weather that's changing. The planet's population has nearly doubled since 1965. According to the World Resources Institute, about 60 per cent of humanity now lives in areas within 100 kilometres of sea coasts, which are generally more vulnerable to floods and storms.
This has increased the potential for loss of life. And in the richer parts of the world, where people and businesses are more likely to have insurance, it has sent insured losses soaring.
Reinsurers are particularly concerned with disasters, since a major function of reinsurance is to allow primary insurers to spread out the risk of catastrophic losses. Globally, the industry is dominated by four European and U.S. companies. Several -- including Mr. Knoepfel's employer, which is known as Swiss Re -- have Canadian subsidiaries.
According to Swiss Re, losses really began to take off in the late 1980s. Between 1970 and 1995, average worldwide insured losses from storms were $3.5-billion (U.S.) a year in 1992 dollars. But between 1989 and 1995 the average was $9.3-billion.
If that increase is sustained, the implications are enormous. Premiums would be boosted substantially and the feasibility of some business projects would be questioned -- not only because of the cost of insurance but because of the climate risk itself.
The worst year for insured losses was 1992, when floods and storms led to more than $20-billion in payouts. That, curiously, was the year of the global economic summit in Rio de Janeiro, where leaders approved a treaty that provides the framework for the continuing climate-change talks.
It was also about the time that Jeremy Leggett, a scientific adviser to Greenpeace International, began telling insurance companies and other financial industries that they'd better start getting a handle on climate change.
Mr. Leggett, a peripatetic campaigner who is based in Britain, could not be reached by telephone this week. But the flavour of his thinking came through in a recent speech quoted by the industry magazine Reinsurance.
He urged reinsurers to raise premiums for businesses involved in "environmentally unfriendly activities," and press governments to let them turn down unacceptable risks. He also said that the insurers should use their stock portfolios to shift investment away from "those companies responsible for exacerbating the greenhouse effect."
At the same time, a growing number of scientists have been working on climate-change research, seeking to discover what exactly was changing and what role human activity was playing.
The work is fraught with controversy and uncertainty. Some of it involves deducing past climate trends from sketchy historical or geological evidence, or projecting future patterns through the use of computer models.
Over several years, the UN-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of more than 200 scientists from about 100 countries, reviewed published, peer-reviewed climate research. It concluded that humans were having a "discernible" effect on climate change, although the extent of the effect and its future development were less certain.
Swiss Re and other insurers say the world can't afford to wait until the last scientific bean has been counted before acting.
"Once we know for sure, it'll be too late," concludes a glossy Swiss Re brochure on global warming. "We do indeed have a problem, and it is far more serious than would appear at first glance."
The company argues that fluctuations in temperature and rainfall extremes are likely to be larger than previously expected. If it is right, anyone whose life or work depends on weather should sit up and take notice.
Wider climate swings could have dramatic effects -- some positive and some negative. They could affect growing seasons, forest cover, drainage patterns, ice caps, sea and lake levels, permafrost and the health of trees in cities.
Some argue that warming might broaden the zones affected by insect-borne diseases such as malaria.
Some scientists have said that the IPCC report overestimates the human contribution to climate change. But the extent to which the concept of climate change has taken hold was underscored in the aftermath of the Saguenay flooding, when Quebec Environment Minister David Cliche commented that because of global warming, disaster planners were going to have to take increasingly extreme weather into account.
That kind of comment may be what Hans Konow, a spokesman for the Canadian Electrical Association, has in mind when he says: "This whole thing hasn't been about science for some time . . . It has a life of its own, like most environmental issues."
Canada has yet to squarely face the issue of climate change. But a showdown of sorts will come in November, when federal and provincial energy and environment ministers hold their annual meeting.
The Liberals' pre-election promise to cut emissions by 20 per cent has receded into history. But polls have shown growing concern among Canadians over climate change, much of it related to weather extremes.
A key question in Canadian policy will be the relationship between the environment and natural-resources ministries. Former environment minister Sheila Copps fought unsuccessfully for tougher emissions standards. The current minister, Sergio Marchi, chaired the Geneva session that drafted the commitment to develop language on mandatory limits. But Natural Resources Minister Anne McLellan has consistently favoured voluntary limits.
The provinces are players, too. For example, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia generate most of their electric power by burning coal and oil -- a significant source of carbon emissions.
Environmentalists want the tightest limits possible. "Anyone can see that in 50 years, we're not going to be dependent on the fossil-fuel industry," said Elizabeth May, executive director of the Sierra Club of Canada. "If we're at the forefront of that change, we'll be way better off than if we cling to oil and gas until it sinks like a stone."
Others say European countries, which already emit less carbon gas per inhabitant than Canada, are manipulating the climate-change talks to their own advantage. And they note that huge amounts of carbon gases are emitted by heavy industries in poor countries such as China and India, which want significant exemptions from any system of controls.
In a brief prepared for presentation to Mr. Marchi last month, business lobbyist Thomas d'Aquino said that Canada should play hardball with negotiators from other countries in the coming months.
"Our traditional role in foreign affairs as honest broker is no longer appropriate when we have so much at stake," said Mr. d'Aquino, who is president of the Business Council on National Issues.
The council believes that voluntary measures will work. Their effectiveness should be judged by measuring concentrations of carbon gases in the atmosphere, not annual emissions, Mr. d'Aquino said.
As for Canadian insurance companies, this month may turn out to be the second-worst in Canadian history in terms of insured losses, says Paul Kovacs, vice-president of the Insurance Bureau of Canada.
The worst month on record so far for Canadian insurers was September, 1991, with $400-million (Canadian) in insured losses, most of it due to a hailstorm in Calgary. The second-worst month was August, 1993, with $200-million in insured losses, mostly due to rains and flooding in Winnipeg.
This month's losses will be higher than $200-million, Mr. Kovacs said. Insured losses reported so far total between $166.5-million and $171.5-million.
The industry has been concentrating its research and policy efforts on earthquake hazards for the past four years, and is only now starting to look at climate change.
Hailstorm losses in particular have been rising steeply in Canada, Mr. Kovacs says, but insurers want to study the conclusions of scientists before taking the kind of policy stands that have been taken in Europe.
"The insurance industry is not really known for leading the parade. But there's something going on and it's costing us money. We don't have to put our heads in the sand. If it's getting fairly clear that the evidence is there, the insurance industry is ready to jump onside."

Abstract: So what has finally defeated the best efforts of these powerful, well-funded lobbyists? One word -- fear. Fear more severe storms caused by global warming may gut the insurance industry. Fear that melting polar ice and rising sea levels may drown some entire small countries that are made up of low-lying islands, like Kiribati, Tuvalu and Tonga, and swamp big chunks of densely populated countries like Bangladesh and the Netherlands. Fear, above all, that it's already too late to stop global temperatures from going up a couple of degrees, and that only urgent action will prevent more drastic changes. A month ago, British Environment Secretary John Gummer announced research predicting that in 30 years southern England will be warm enough for malaria-bearing mosquitoes.

Full text: THE `White House effect' has finally been applied to the greenhouse effect. If you're planning to be alive much past 2010, or have children who will be, this is very good news.
George Bush first promised to cut carbon dioxide emissions during the 1988 election campaign, but he ran for cover when US industries complained it might cost them profits. For the past eight years, US policy has been there should be only `voluntary' controls (none).
Now, however, it is Bill Clinton's re-election campaign, and there just might be some votes in trying to save the world. So last week US Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Timothy Wirth announced a dramatic reversal of American policy. "What we want is a binding target for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that is agreed internationally." Though it will not produce any immediate results, this is probably the most important event of the year.
The International Climate Change Conference has just wound up in Geneva without agreeing on the target. Ten percent cuts by 2005?
Twenty percent? That will be decided in the next eight months, on the basis of how much emissions must be cut to hold the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. Dancing in the streets would be premature, but a major corner has been turned: the principle of universal, mandatory cuts has been accepted internationally. The forces of darkness have been defeated.
Eileen Clausson, who led the American delegation at the conference, was quite blunt about who those forces are. "They are a very strong group of people who muddy the science. We call them the Naysayers." The Naysayer with the highest profile is Don Pearlman, an American lawyer. At every international political and scientific conference on climate change for years, his lobbyists have challenged the wording of documents and obscured the clarity of the conclusions. Pearlman will not say who he works for, but is usually with Saudi and Kuwaiti delegates.
But Pearlman and the fossil-fuel exporters were not nearly as effective as the misleadingly named Global Climate Coalition. It sounds like an environment-friendly group, but its membership includes the `Seven Sisters' (oil giants Shell, Texaco, Exxon, British Petroleum, Amoco, Chevron and Mobil), plus Ford and General Motors, Dow Chemicals and Union Carbide, the Air Transport Association, and other big energy users like the aluminium industry. With apparently limitless funds at its disposal, the GCC has worked to convince the world's media and the US Congress that global warning is an "open question" about which it would be premature to actually do anything.
So what has finally defeated the best efforts of these powerful, well-funded lobbyists? One word -- fear. Fear more severe storms caused by global warming may gut the insurance industry. Fear that melting polar ice and rising sea levels may drown some entire small countries that are made up of low-lying islands, like Kiribati, Tuvalu and Tonga, and swamp big chunks of densely populated countries like Bangladesh and the Netherlands. Fear, above all, that it's already too late to stop global temperatures from going up a couple of degrees, and that only urgent action will prevent more drastic changes. A month ago, British Environment Secretary John Gummer announced research predicting that in 30 years southern England will be warm enough for malaria-bearing mosquitoes.
So the 150 countries at Geneva have bulldozed the Naysayers aside. The economic and social implications will ultimately be huge, though some years will pass before people begin to feel a direct impact on their lifestyles. And of course, nobody can guarantee that it's not already too late. But at last there is agreement in principle to try. That is worth a lot.

Abstract: Fear has finally defeated the best efforts of these powerful, well-funded lobbyists; fear that more severe storms caused by global warming may gut the insurance industry. Pay-outs for storm damage in 1990-95 already total $48 billion, three times the figure for all of the 80s, and 58 international insurance companies went to Geneva to demand "early substantial reductions" in greenhouse-gas emissions; fear that melting polar ice and rising sea levels may drown some entire small countries that are made up of low-lying islands, like Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Maldives and Tonga, and swamp big chunks of densely populated countries like the Netherlands; fear, above all, that it's already too late to stop global temperatures from going up a couple of degrees, and that only urgent action will forestall even more drastic changes.

Full text: The "White House effect" has finally been applied to the greenhouse effect. This is very good news.
George Bush first promised to use the White House's power to cut carbon dioxide emissions during the 1988 election campaign, but he ran for cover when U.S. industries complained that it might cost them profits. For the past eight years, official U.S. policy has been that there should be only voluntary controls (i.e. none).

A major corner has been turned: The principle of universal, mandatory cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions has been accepted by the international community.

It publicizes the findings of any scientists who deny the validity of the evidence for global warming -- what the World Wide Fund for Nature calls "junk science paid for by the oil and coal lobbies."
Fear has finally defeated the best efforts of these powerful, well-funded lobbyists; fear that more severe storms caused by global warming may gut the insurance industry.

So the 150 countries at Geneva have bulldozed the Naysayers aside and started down the long, hard road to controlling greenhouse-gas emissions.
At last we have agreement in principle to try. That is worth a lot.

Worried insurers want action on global warming Companies see Quebec flood as part of trend: [Final Edition]

Abstract: OTTAWA - Droughts and downpours, hail storms and hurricanes. The rising incidence of weather-related disasters has set off alarm bells in the property insurance industry. The Saguenay deluge of the last week is part of a trend that has insurance companies around the world calling for action to combat global warming. ``There's no question in the mind of the insurance industry that there are more storms and they're more severe,'' Paul Kovacs, vice-president of the Insurance Bureau of Canada, said in an interview yesterday.

Full text: OTTAWA - Droughts and downpours, hail storms and hurricanes. The rising incidence of weather-related disasters has set off alarm bells in the property insurance industry.
The Saguenay deluge of the last week is part of a trend that has insurance companies around the world calling for action to combat global warming.
``There's no question in the mind of the insurance industry that there are more storms and they're more severe,'' Paul Kovacs, vice-president of the Insurance Bureau of Canada, said in an interview yesterday.
The bureau, which represents hundreds of Canadian insurance companies, has set up a special group to study the impact of climate change.
Scientists have been saying for years that rising temperatures could change storm patterns and cause more erratic weather.
A recent report this month from the International Panel on Climate Change, composed of hundreds of scientists, concluded that with climate warming ``the hydrological cycle will become more vigorous.''
Insurance executives tend to use more direct language.
``You will get periods of intense rainfall, thunderstorm- type events, hailstorms, alternating with quite prolonged, nasty droughts,'' said Andre Dlugolecki of General Accident PLC, parent company of General Accident Assurance Co. of Canada.
MORE NUMEROUS
``The balance of rainfall will be changing and we do believe that there are signs of that already happening,'' Dlugolecki said in an interview from Perth, Scotland.
``There are definite signs that extreme rainfall events are becoming more numerous.''
This month in Geneva, a group of 60 insurance companies called for early and substantial cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, which are blamed for global warming.
In a position paper released at a United Nations climate conference, the companies said they have concluded that human activity is already affecting climate on a global scale.
``The insurance industry has a lot of data regarding extreme weather events,'' said Bernd Schanzenbacher, an official with the UN Environment Program in Geneva.
``They're more or less convinced that these events - storms, floods - are caused by climate change.''
Greenhouse gases are transparent to the incoming rays of the sun, but block those same rays when they bounce back from the surface of the Earth at a shorter wavelength. That prevents the heat from being reflected into space.
Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, is released through the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal.
The insurance bureau says insurance costs from some weather-related disasters in recent years include:
* Hailstorm in the Prairies last week: $60 million, with claims still coming in.
* Flooding in Winnipeg, July 25 to Aug. 14, 1993: $21 million.
* Windstorm in southern Ontario, Nov. 12 to 13, 1992: $18 million.
* Hail in Calgary, Sept. 7, 1991: $62 million.
* Tornado in Sarnia, March 27 to 28, 1991: $13 million.
* Tornado in Edmonton, July 31, 1987: $29 million.

With apparently limitless funds at its disposal, the Global Climate Coalition has worked to convince the world's media and the U.S. Congress that global warning is an "open question" about which it would be premature to actually do anything. It publicizes the findings of any scientists who deny the validity of the evidence for global warming what the World Wide Fund for Nature calls "junk science paid for by the oil and coal lobbies." Its strategy is sabotage, confusion and delay.
So what has finally defeated the best efforts of these powerful, well-funded lobbyists? One word: fear.
Fear that more severe storms caused by global warming may gut the insurance industry. Pay-outs for storm damage in 1990-95 already total $48 billion, three times the figure for all of the '80s, and 58 international insurance companies went to Geneva to demand "early substantial reductions" in greenhouse-gas emissions.
Fear that melting polar ice and rising sea levels may drown entire small countries made up of low-lying islands, like Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Maldives and Tonga, and swamp big chunks of densely populated countries like Bangladesh and the Netherlands.
Fear, above all, that it's already too late to stop global temperatures from going up a couple of degrees, and that only urgent action will forestall even more drastic changes. Two weeks before the Geneva conference, British Environment Secretary John Gummer announced the results of a study predicting that in 30 years southern England will be warm enough for malaria-bearing mosquitoes, Paris will have the climate of the south of France and Spain will be mostly a desert.
So the 150 countries at Geneva have bulldozed the Naysayers aside and started down the long, hard road to controlling greenhouse-gas emissions. The economic and social implications will ultimately be huge, though some years will pass before people begin to feel a direct impact on their lifestyles. And of course, nobody can guarantee that it's not already too late.
But at last we have agreement in principle to try. That is worth a lot.

Abstract: OTTAWA (CP) -- Droughts and downpours, hail storms and hurricanes. The rising incidence of weather-related disasters has set off alarm bells in the property insurance industry. A recent report this month from the International Panel on Climate Change, comprised of hundreds of scientists, concluded that with climate warming "the hydrological cycle will become more vigorous." "You will get periods of intense rainfall, thunderstorm-type events, hailstorms, alternating with quite prolonged, nasty droughts," said Andre Dlugolecki of General Accident PLC, parent company of General Accident Assurance Co. of Canada.

"The insurance industry has a lot of data regarding extreme weather events," said Bernd Schanzenbacher, an official with the UN Environment Program in Geneva.
"They're more or less convinced that these events storms, floods are caused by climate change."

Greenhouse gases are transparent to the incoming rays of the sun, but block those same rays when they bounce back from the surface of the Earth at a shorter wavelength. That prevents the heat from being reflected into space.
Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, is released through the burning of fossil fuels like oil and coal.

Full text: The ``White House effect'' finally has been applied to the greenhouse effect. If you're planning to be alive much past 2010, or have children who will be, this is very good news.
George Bush first promised to use the White House's power to cut carbon dioxide emissions during the 1988 election campaign, but he ran for cover when U.S. industries complained that it might cost them profits. For the past eight years, official U.S. policy has been that there should be only ``voluntary'' controls (i.e. none).
Now, however, it is Bill Clinton's re-election campaign, and there just might be some votes in trying to save the world. So on July 17, at the International Climate Change Conference in Geneva, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Timothy Wirth announced a dramatic reversal of American policy.
``Our approach here is to have a straight target that everybody has to sign up to,'' said Wirth. ``What we want is a binding target for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that is agreed internationally.''
Though it will not produce any immediate results, this is probably the most important event of the year.
The International Climate Change Conference has just wound up without agreeing on what the target should be. Ten per cent cuts by 2005? Twenty per cent cuts? That will be decided in the next eight months, on the basis of how much emissions must be cut to hold the global temperature rise to 2 degrees C. (3.6 degrees F).
Dancing in the streets would, therefore, be a bit premature, but a major corner has been turned: the principle of universal, mandatory cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions has been accepted by the international community. The forces of darkness have been defeated.
Eileen Clausson, who led the American delegation at the climate conference, was blunt about who they are and how they operate: ``They are a very strong group of people who muddy the science. We call them the Naysayers.''
The Naysayer with the highest profile is Don Pearlman, an American lawyer. At every international political conference and scientific meeting on climate change for the past several years, his lobbyists have been present to challenge the wording of documents and obscure the clarity of the scientists' conclusions. Pearlman will not reveal for whom he works, but he is usually seen with Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti delegates.
Those countries oppose greenhouse-gas restrictions because the market for fossil fuels will go into a steep decline if the industrial countries start cutting carbon dioxide emissions, and then who will buy their oil? (Australia, a major coal exporter, was also allied with the Naysayers at Geneva.)
But Pearlman and the fossil-fuel exporters were not nearly as effective as the misleadingly named Global Climate Coalition. It sounds like an environment-friendly group, but its membership includes the ``Seven Sisters'' (oil giants Shell, Texaco, Exxon, British Petroleum, Amoco, Chevron and Mobil), plus Ford and General Motors, Dow Chemicals and Union Carbide, the Air Transport Association, and other big energy users like the aluminum industry.
With apparently limitless funds at its disposal, the GCC has worked to convince the world's media and the U.S. Congress that global warming is an ``open question'' about which it would be premature to actually do anything. It publicizes the findings of any scientists who deny the validity of the evidence for global warming - what the World Wide Fund for Nature calls ``junk science paid for by the oil and coal lobbies.'' Its strategy is sabotage, confusion and delay.
So what has finally defeated the best efforts of these powerful, well-funded lobbyists? One word: fear.
Fear that more severe storms caused by global warming may gut the insurance industry. Payouts for storm damage in 1990-95 already total $48 billion, three times the figure for all of the '80s, and 58 international insurance companies went to Geneva to demand ``early substantial reductions'' in greenhouse-gas emissions.
Fear that melting polar ice and rising sea levels may drown some entire small countries that are made up of low-lying islands, like Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Maldives and Tonga, and swamp big chunks of densely populated countries like Bangladesh and the Netherlands.
Fear, above all, that it's already too late to stop global temperatures from going up a couple of degrees, and that only urgent action will forestall even more drastic changes. Two weeks before the Geneva conference, British Environment Secretary John Gummer announced the results of a study predicting that in 30 years, southern England will be warm enough for malaria-bearing mosquitoes, Paris will have the climate of the south of France - and Spain will be mostly a desert.
So the 150 countries at Geneva have bulldozed the Naysayers aside and started down the long, hard road to controlling greenhouse-gas emissions. The economic and social implications will ultimately be huge, though some years will pass before people begin to feel a direct impact on their lifestyles. And, of course, nobody can guarantee that it's not already too late.
But at last we have agreement in principle to try. That is worth a lot.

Freaks or climate change?: [3 Edition]

Abstract: The odds are strengthening on climate change. In their latest five-year report to the UN, 2500 climate scientists said more than a century of burning oil, coal and gas had begun to have a "discernible" effect on climate. To bring the climate back to a new, stable state, greenhouse gas emissions would eventually have to be more than halved. In Geneva last week, New Zealand's Environment Minister Simon Upton chided Pacific leaders at a private meeting for saying the hurricanes were becoming more frequent and more destructive. That wasn't yet a scientific certainty, he told them: climate scientists had not yet reached agreement on whether or not storms would become more severe as the climate changed. While European nations put pressure on their industries to develop new, clean technologies that would not emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, New Zealand has preferred to emphasise the doubts of the handful of sceptical scientists brought to New Zealand by the Business Roundtable and its associates.

Full text: US about-face. Instead of insisting only on voluntary emission reductions, the United States now wants specific targets.
IN CHINA the worst floods in history have damaged millions of hectares of productive cropland, stranded nearly four million people and damaged 2.8 million homes in eight provinces.
Mongolia is still reeling from fires which raged across its steppes for three months earlier this year, destroying at least 88,000sq km of grassland and forest and killing 25 people along with thousands of livestock. Traditionally heavy winter snowfalls were only patchy in Mongolia this year, and the combination of tinder-dry grass and unusually high winds created ideal conditions for the fires.
In New Zealand, this winter has brought Gisborne the worst flooding since Cyclone Bola in 1988, while in Invercargill, unusually cold weather forced insurance companies to move up to 10 families into motel accommodation after burst pipes caused up to $30,000 of damage in each home.
Freak weather? Or the longer-term pattern of climate change?
The odds are strengthening on climate change. In their latest five-year report to the UN, 2500 climate scientists said more than a century of burning oil, coal and gas had begun to have a "discernible" effect on climate. To bring the climate back to a new, stable state, greenhouse gas emissions would eventually have to be more than halved.
In February Environment Ministers from the 26 OECD member States endorsed that statement.
Last week the US threw its weight behind calls for a more urgent approach to emission reductions. At a meeting of the world's Environment Ministers in Geneva, the US reversed its earlier opposition to any legally binding international targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Instead of insisting only on voluntary emission reductions, Under- Secretary of State for Global Affairs Timothy Wirth said the US now wanted specific targets. The US, he said, was determined to "lead the international community away from the menace of possible global disaster caused by global warming".
The decision that more decisive action was needed was backed by reports from the UN's own Environmental Programme (UNEP), the World Health Organisation, a coalition of global insurance companies, new technology industries, and small island states.
Small island states have been among the strongest voices at international conferences discussing what to do about climate change. As the planet warms, the water in the oceans will expand, raising sea levels. For island states such as Tuvalu and the Maldives, where the highest land point is only a metre or so above sea level at present, the entire country will eventually disappear.
Insurance companies' concerns about increasingly big payouts for severe storms are shared by island nations. For more than three years they have told international conferences that the storms are getting worse.
In Geneva last week, New Zealand's Environment Minister Simon Upton chided Pacific leaders at a private meeting for saying the hurricanes were becoming more frequent and more destructive. That wasn't yet a scientific certainty, he told them: climate scientists had not yet reached agreement on whether or not storms would become more severe as the climate changed.
While European nations put pressure on their industries to develop new, clean technologies that would not emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, New Zealand has preferred to emphasise the doubts of the handful of sceptical scientists brought to New Zealand by the Business Roundtable and its associates.
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ross Gelbspan has documented the money paid to five scientists by oil and coal interests. Three of the five have briefed New Zealand officials, industry leaders and the media.
In an article written for the December 1995 issue of Harper's magazine, Gelbspan said Patrick Michaels, the latest of the five to visit New Zealand, had received more than $US115,000 over the past four years from coal and energy interests.
Richard Lindzen, who visited New Zealand last year, "charges oil and coal interests $US2500 a day for his consulting services . . . His 1991 trip to testify before a Senate committee was paid for by Western Fuels, and a speech he wrote, entitled Global Warming: The Origin and Nature of Alleged Scientific Consensus, was underwritten by OPEC (Oil Producing and Exporting Countries)."
Fred Singer, another sceptical scientist who was brought to New Zealand, has received consulting fees from Exxon, Shell, Unocal, ARCO and Sun Oil.
To date, industry lobbyists and the Government have complained that reducing carbon dioxide emissions would be too expensive. A variety of overseas studies show that argument may be simplistic and in many cases, wrong.
The forecasts of economic doom are balanced by less widely publicised but equally credible analyses showing action to cut emissions could in fact boost economic growth. Technologies to replace oil, coal and gas are already developed. At last week's conference in Geneva, the US and European Business Councils told Environment Ministers that mass production of technology that taps clean, renewable energy sources could stop world dependence on coal and oil without economic hardship. But they said hard lobbying by wealthy oil, power and auto companies were blocking a switch to renewable energy.

That will be decided in the next eight months, on the basis of how much emissions must be cut to hold the global temperature rise to 2 degrees C. (3.6 degrees F).
Dancing in the streets would, therefore, be a bit premature, but a major corner has been turned: the principle of universal, mandatory cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions has been accepted by the international community. The forces of darkness have been defeated.
Eileen Clausson, who led the American delegation at the climate conference, was blunt about who they are and how they operate: ``They are a very strong group of people who muddy the science. We call them the Naysayers.''
The Naysayer with the highest profile is Don Pearlman, an American lawyer. At every international political conference and scientific meeting on climate change for the past several years, his lobbyists have been present to challenge the wording of documents and obscure the clarity of the scientists' conclusions. Pearlman will not reveal for whom he works, but he is usually seen with Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti delegates.
Those countries oppose greenhouse-gas restrictions because the market for fossil fuels will go into a steep decline if the industrial countries start cutting carbon dioxide emissions, and then who will buy their oil? (Australia, a major coal exporter, was also allied with the Naysayers at Geneva.)
But Pearlman and the fossil-fuel exporters were not nearly as effective as the misleadingly named Global Climate Coalition. It sounds like an environment-friendly group, but its membership includes the ``Seven Sisters'' (oil giants Shell, Texaco, Exxon, British Petroleum, Amoco, Chevron and Mobil), plus Ford and General Motors, Dow Chemicals and Union Carbide, the Air Transport Association, and other big energy users like the aluminum industry.
With apparently limitless funds at its disposal, the GCC has worked to convince the world's media and the U.S. Congress that global warming is an ``open question'' about which it would be premature to actually do anything. It publicizes the findings of any scientists who deny the validity of the evidence for global warming - what the World Wide Fund for Nature calls ``junk science paid for by the oil and coal lobbies.'' Its strategy is sabotage, confusion and delay.
So what has finally defeated the best efforts of these powerful, well-funded lobbyists? One word: fear.
Fear that more severe storms caused by global warming may gut the insurance industry. Payouts for storm damage in 1990-95 already total $48 billion, three times the figure for all of the '80s, and 58 international insurance companies went to Geneva to demand ``early substantial reductions'' in greenhouse-gas emissions.
Fear that melting polar ice and rising sea levels may drown some entire small countries that are made up of low-lying islands, like Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Maldives and Tonga, and swamp big chunks of densely populated countries like Bangladesh and the Netherlands.
Fear, above all, that it's already too late to stop global temperatures from going up a couple of degrees, and that only urgent action will forestall even more drastic changes. Two weeks before the Geneva conference, British Environment Secretary John Gummer announced the results of a study predicting that in 30 years, southern England will be warm enough for malaria-bearing mosquitoes, Paris will have the climate of the south of France - and Spain will be mostly a desert.
So the 150 countries at Geneva have bulldozed the Naysayers aside and started down the long, hard road to controlling greenhouse-gas emissions. The economic and social implications will ultimately be huge, though some years will pass before people begin to feel a direct impact on their lifestyles. And, of course, nobody can guarantee that it's not already too late.
But at last we have agreement in principle to try. That is worth a lot.

Human induced global warming is probably the biggest scientific ``if'' our civilization has ever known. But if it is indeed happening, it is very serious. And global warming wouldn't mean every place on the planet gets two degrees warmer, it would mean climate change. Some places would become a bit colder, others would become a lot hotter. Patterns of climate that have developed and remained relatively stable for thousands of years would be disrupted, resulting in more weird weather; more hurricanes, tornados, droughts, floods and heat waves. Just in case, wouldn't preventive conservation measures be cheap insurance?

NUCLEAR POWER: BOOM OR BUST? ENVIRONMENTALISTS SHOULD RETHINK THE ISSUE: [ALL EDITION]

Abstract: Fossil-fuel combustion poses a serious risk but environmentalists who continue to insist that renewables can replace fossi1 fuels in generating electricity are engaged in a fuzzy-minded exercise of monumental unimportance. The fact is, only six-tenths of 1 percent of the nation's electricity currently comes from solar, wind and geothermal sources. To compete, renewable energy sources must reduce their costs faster than conventional energy. Today, France gets more than 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and exports nuclear-generated electricity to other European countries. Also, because France uses relatively little fossil fuel to produce electricity, its per capita output of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is the lowest of any major industrialized country. The rest of the industrialized world is using nuclear energyand will continue to develop and advance the technology. The United States should not relinquish its leadership role. Projected sharp cuts in nuclear research and development, especially in advanced light-water reactor technology, could do serious harm to our national competitiveness and undermine our international commitments to achieve compliance on greenhouse gas emissions.

Full text: Jones is professor and head of the department of nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois.
Before we become too sanguine about the prospects of using renewable energy sources to reduce both the risks of dependence on fossil fuels and global climate change, it's worth looking at a report by National Economic Research Associates, which should give pause to even the most optimistic advocate of solar energy.
The report forecasts that electric power output from hydro, solar and other renewable sources will continue to rise slightly over the next decade. But the report warns that the good times are over for the renewable energy industry.
"Environmental opposition to hydroelectric relicensing on scenic rivers and (more importantly) a growing realization that expensive alternative energy schemes cannot survive in a competitive environment suggest that electricity generation using renewable energy will grow relatively slowly during the next 10 years," the report asserts.
Make no mistake: I favor the increased use of renewables and other energy sources that will not degrade the environment. The chief reason is the greenhouse effect, the threatened change in Earth's climate by waste gases mostly produced by the burning of coal, oil and gasoline.
Fossil-fuel combustion poses a serious risk but environmentalists who continue to insist that renewables can replace fossi1 fuels in generating electricity are engaged in a fuzzy-minded exercise of monumental unimportance. The fact is, only six-tenths of 1 percent of the nation's electricity currently comes from solar, wind and geothermal sources. To compete, renewable energy sources must reduce their costs faster than conventional energy.
In this uncertain environment, it would be irresponsible not to plan for a future that includes nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is prudent, strategic insurance against any number of environmental and economic shock.
Action is needed to make nuclear energy a real option for electric utilities. Congress can show we are serious about air quality by providing the impetus for a new generation of advanced nuclear plants that use standardized designs to make them cost competitive with other types of new electric-generating plants.
Experience overseas demonstrates the benefits of standardization. The French nuclear program is based on common designs for nuclear power plants. Because their plants can be built faster than custom-designed plants, the cost of French nuclear power is among the lowest in the world.
Today, France gets more than 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and exports nuclear-generated electricity to other European countries. Also, because France uses relatively little fossil fuel to produce electricity, its per capita output of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is the lowest of any major industrialized country.
Few nations, including the United States, can afford to ignore the improved safety features of standardized reactor designs. The goal is for next-generation nuclear plants to be so safe that in the worst conceivable accident, they will shut themselves down with little or no intervention.
Yet, some members of Congress want to eliminate funding for a five-year program, cost-shared with industry and only a year away from completion, that will provide standardized designs for advanced light water reactors. Industry funds are paid by the Advanced Reactor Corporation, a group of 11 major utilities, including Wisconsin Electric Power Co.
The legislators forget that Presidents Reagan and Bush were strong supporters of the advanced reactor program -- and so is the Clinton administration.
The program costs the government only $40 million to complete -- which is about one-quarter of 1 percent of the Energy Department's $16.3 billion funding request for fiscal 1997.
Besides, the government's investment will be repaid through royalties on the sale of these new light water reactors. Since exports alone offer the potential for billions of dollars in revenues, the proposed spending on the advanced reactor is a small price to pay for determining whether its large gains are achievable.
The rest of the industrialized world is using nuclear energyand will continue to develop and advance the technology. The United States should not relinquish its leadership role. Projected sharp cuts in nuclear research and development, especially in advanced light-water reactor technology, could do serious harm to our national competitiveness and undermine our international commitments to achieve compliance on greenhouse gas emissions.
That is why those who call themselves environmentalists should rethink nuclear energy. If we are to keep a lid on the very realenvironmental and health costs of power production and still provide sufficient electricity for a growing economy, we will need conservation, gas turbines and renewable energy sources, along with advanced nuclear power plants.

Oil and coal lobby feel the heat as greenhouse gas debate warms up The Geneva declaration on climate change shows there is a commitment to tackle global warming, writes Frank McDonald, Environment Correspondent: [CITY EDITION]

Abstract: Over the next 18 months, the 54 countries which have ratified the Climate Change Convention will continue the negotiations with a view to reaching agreement on quantified and binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, notably carbon dioxide, at the third Conference of the Parties in Kyoto at the end of next year. The insurance industry came to Geneva, as it did to Berlin last year, to demand concerted international action on the issue. Already suffering a series of major losses from natural disasters, its spokesmen insisted that the negotiations "must achieve early and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions." Dubbed "king of the carbon club" by environmental groups, he was in Geneva for the full two weeks of negotiations at the second Conference of the Parties. Last Thursday, before its ministerial declaration was adopted, he was observed by reporters giving guidance to the Saudi delegates on what they should say.

Full text: IT could have been a non event. Instead, the second Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change produced a strong ministerial declaration committing industrialised countries to negotiating a legally binding international protocol to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
Although Saudi Arabia scored a technical victory at yesterday's concluding session with the deletion of a reference in the report to the urgent need to act on compelling scientific evidence that atmospheric pollution is causing a rise in global temperatures, this crucial link survives in what has become known as the Geneva Declaration.
Over the next 18 months, the 54 countries which have ratified the Climate Change Convention will continue the negotiations with a view to reaching agreement on quantified and binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, notably carbon dioxide, at the third Conference of the Parties in Kyoto at the end of next year.
The fact that the US is now prepared to put its considerable weight behind this process, as the world's only superpower, means that it has a real chance of success. In Geneva, for the first time, it strongly committed itself to negotiating "realistic, verifiable and binding" targets to reverse global warming.
What this means, in effect, is that the obstructionist efforts of Saudi Arabia and other countries with a clear vested interest in the status quo are unlikely to be permitted to prevent an international agreement on the issue. There is also a widespread consensus that firm action needs to be taken.
President Clinton has obviously calculated that there are more votes in being seen to be "green" than by continuing to heed the pleadings of the fossil fuel lobby.
The US Vice President, Mr Al Gore, no doubt played a role in his conversion as he has described climate change as "the greatest threat to our civilisation".
Environmental groups such as Greenpeace, the Climate Action Coalition and the World Wide Fund for Nature are unanimous in their view that significant progress was made at the Geneva talks, which were held in the vast 1930s neo classical League of Nations building, reputedly the largest palais in Europe after Versailles.
Delegates were reminded by the British Environment Secretary, Mr John Gummer, that the old League had "failed the world" by giving in to power and special interest groups.
Britain is on course to fulfil its commitment under the Climate Change Convention to return its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. It has done so by taking such "no regrets" measures as switching electricity generation from coal to natural gas and putting more emphasis on energy efficiency.
Like Germany, which will also meet the target, it believes that cuts of up to 10 per cent can be made after 2000 without people feeling the pinch. Only then would it become necessary to tackle the transport sector, which has become the fastest growing contributor to the phenomenon of global warming.
Ireland, as a small and less developed country within the EU, is protected by the "European bubble", as the Minister for the Environment, Mr Howlin, put it. Assuming that the larger EU member states manage to cut their greenhouse gas emissions Ireland's projected 5 per cent increase will have only a marginal impact.
By 2000, however, the UN's intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of some 2,500 scientists from around the world, will have produced its third assessment report. This is expected to "harden up the science", leaving no room for doubt that measures must be taken to counter global warming.
The insurance industry came to Geneva, as it did to Berlin last year, to demand concerted international action on the issue. Already suffering a series of major losses from natural disasters, its spokesmen insisted that the negotiations "must achieve early and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions."
However, it is unclear at this stage if the insurance companies will put resources into the relentless lobbing required to counter the activities of the "carbon club", Greenpeace's nickname for the coalition of oil, coal and motor manufacturing industries which monitors the talks continuously.
Its chief lobbyist, Mr Donald Pearlman, a Washington corporate lawyer, has read every single line of the thousands of documents generated by the Climate Change Convention. He has been a constant, if shadowy, presence at every round of talks on global warming since the whole process got under way in 1988.
Dubbed "king of the carbon club" by environmental groups, he was in Geneva for the full two weeks of negotiations at the second Conference of the Parties. Last Thursday, before its ministerial declaration was adopted, he was observed by reporters giving guidance to the Saudi delegates on what they should say.
Saudi Arabia, as the world's richest oil producer, has a lot to lose if the major industrialised countries make legally binding commitments to cut their carbon dioxide emissions. So do the other OPEC states and Australia, with its huge coal reserves.
The Global Climate Coalition, which represents the fossil fuel lobby, claimed last week that a selective use of carbon taxes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would destabilise the US economy, cutting its GDP by up to 2.3 per cent and leading to the loss of as many as one million jobs per year.
Increasingly, however, the fossil fuel lobby's claims are being seen as so shrill as to lack credibility. There is already enough hard scientific evidence on the ground, including a progressive "meltdown" of Switzerland's glaciers, to persuade the world's politicians that action can no longer be delayed.

Abstract: A search-and-rescue effort for TWA Flight 800 continued. The plane went down off New York with 229 passengers on board. So far, officials said they've recovered more than 73 bodies. The Coast Guard said none wore life jackets, suggesting the explosion came without warning. Security was tightened in St. Louis, where TWA is based. And both federal safety investigators and the FBI have launched investigations. Attorney General Janet Reno said nothing about the crash points to terrorism, but added two calls were received claiming responsibility after the fact. The House approved a spending bill that would chop the IRS's budget by 11 percent to $6.6 billion and eliminate about 2,000 jobs. The White House opposes the bill, saying it would delay refunds, limit tax collections, and reduce taxpayer services. Before being enacted, the bill would have to be reconciled with a yet-to-be-written Senate version. The House also introduced legislation aimed at protecting fire insurance for churches. The move came after reports that some churches hit by the recent rash of fires have had their insurance canceled. The House also passed a bill that makes lying to Congress a crime. Secret Service agents told Congress they did not provide names to a White House employee who used them to collect FBI background files on more than 400 officials. Their testimony disputes that of the White House. The supervisor of White House access control said 379 of the 476 names were listed as inactive prior to the project of updating security passes and would not have been included on a list.

The Federal Reserve will raise interest rates if necessary to dampen inflation, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee. His comments fit analysts' expectations that the Fed will vote to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in a 1-1/2 years when it meets Aug. 20.
The Pentagon is beginning to relocate as many as 4,000 US troops based in Saudi Arabia to combat a "very intense threat" of terrorism. Defense Secretary Perry said the move will be costly but necessary, citing intelligence reports of threats of car bombings and even chemical or biological weapons attacks.
The US trade deficit in goods and services jumped 13.2 percent in May to $10.9 billion - its highest level in eight years. A record $69.8 billion in exports wasn't enough to offset the record $80.6 billion in imports, the Commerce Department said.
A newly public memo backs up a tobacco industry whistle-blower's claims that Brown & Williamson tried to cover up evidence that nicotine is addictive. Separately, a study by Italian researchers put nicotine in a class with cocaine, morphine, and amphetamines.
A jury in Little Rock, Ark., was expected to hear President Clinton's videotaped testimony in defense of two Arkansas bankers accused of dipping into bank funds to curry favor with then-Governor Clinton.
Newsweek columnist Joe Klein admitted to being the man behind Washington's favorite mystery. Klein is "Anonymous," author of "Primary Colors," a book Washington insiders say closely mirrors Clinton's '92 campaign. Klein said only three people knew his secret identity: his wife, his agent, and News-week editor Maynard Parker.
Secret Service agents told Congress they did not provide names to a White House employee who used them to collect FBI background files on more than 400 officials.

The Earth's solid-iron inner core rotates about 1.1 degrees faster than the rest of the planet, geologists announced in New York. The mechanism is similar to an electric motor. The scientists hope their discovery will eventually explain the origin of the Earth's magnetic fields.
The US will accept a compromise version of a proposed global nuclear test-ban treaty, Secretary of State Christopher said. It was the first public acknowledgement that the US supports the draft.
Massachusetts rape crisis counselor Nassrine Farhoody won her fight to keep a client's records out of the courtroom when the state's Supreme Judicial Court threw out a contempt order against her.
THE WORLD
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Cairo he will honor the peace treaties Israel signed with its neighbors. It was his first visit to an Arab nation since his May 7 election. He also said Foreign Minister David Levy will meet Palestinian President Arafat next week. Responding to Netanyahu's softened tone, Egyptian President Mubarak said that their meeting left him optimistic on the future of the Middle East peace process.
Unless Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic steps down, his party will be banned from Sept. 4 elections, said US envoy Richard Holbrooke, key architect of the Dayton accord. Also, Bosnian Serb and Yugoslav officials met in Belgrade to mull over the West's demand for Karadzic's arrest. And the Serb mayor of Ugljevik, Bosnia, threatened to capture and kill UN police monitors if Karadzic is arrested.
A man claiming to be Salman Raduyev, a Chechen rebel commander whom the Russians reported dead, held a news conference in Gudermes, Chechnya. He said he was in Germany for medical treatment. Russian military said in March that Raduyev died of battle wounds. At least two journalists said the man appeared to be Raduyev. The man said rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev is alive as well.
The Sri Lankan Army flew in reinforcements to support 1,200 soldiers besieged by Tamil separatists at a northern air base. The attack by 4,000 Tamil rebels on the Mullaittivu base was one of the biggest in the country's 13-year civil war. There were no reports of casualties.
UN arms experts suspended their operations after Iraq blocked access to a site near Baghdad. They were investigating Iraq's banned weapons program under the Gulf War cease-fire. Last month Iraq pledged to grant inspectors immediate, unconditional, and unrestricted access to all suspected sites.
Australia's push for tough gun laws received a boost when Queensland and the Northern Territory dropped their opposition to a proposed ban on semi-automatic and pump-action rifles. Western Australia is the lone dissenter and is expected to relent, federal officials said.
Japan's trade surplus dropped 40 percent in the first half of this year, its biggest decline in 16 years for a six-month period. The decline reflects moves by Japanese manufacturers to shift production overseas to avoid high labor costs and a strong yen, which erodes profits. Also, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said it will recall about 650,000 cars worldwide to replace faulty brake parts.
A Philippine court acquitted six Pakistanis accused of terrorism, saying evidence against them may have been planted by police. The acquittals raised questions about Manila's anti-terrorist campaign.
Ministers at the Conference on Climate Change in Geneva considered creating a legal instrument to enforce measures to reduce carbon gas emissions. The move was spurred when the US reversed its policy of supporting only voluntary reductions.
Southeast Asian nations planned to improve cooperation with projects including scientific development and AIDS prevention at an ASEAN standing committee meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia. The committee is expected to defend its decision not to demand sanctions against Burma at an ASEAN Regional Forum meeting next week. Burma is expected to eventually become a member of ASEAN.

After savoring two strawberry shakes at a truck stop, he planned to renew ties with his mother and grandmother. He is the third prisoner in the past month to be freed because of DNA evidence.
A ring Tanya Tokevich bought in Vancouver, Canada, for $20 was more than cheap costume jewelry. It turned out to be an $11,000 antique diamond ring, proving Mark Twain's adage: "Let us not be too particular. It is better to have second-hand diamonds than none at all."

Abstract: Florida Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson has viewed the Earth from a perspective reserved for a select group of people. In 1986, as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, the current Florida Insurance commissioner rode on the space shuttle Columbia, and looked down on the planet from orbit. "From that vantage point, changes in the Earth's weather and climate can seem peaceful and benign," he said last month at a meeting in Miami on climate change. "But, from down here, we know the fury that can lurk beneath the cloud cover. And we're finally beginning to realize that we human beings may be contributing to climate changes that could prove catastrophic." "Of the 50 states in our nation, Florida is the most vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change," Nelson said. "If the Earth continues to warm up, as scientists predict, our state could suffer relentless heat waves, beaches submerged by rising sea levels, contaminated drinking water, and more severe and damaging hurricanes."

Full text: Florida Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson has viewed the Earth from a perspective reserved for a select group of people. In 1986, as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, the current Florida Insurance commissioner rode on the space shuttle Columbia, and looked down on the planet from orbit.
"From that vantage point, changes in the Earth's weather and climate can seem peaceful and benign," he said last month at a meeting in Miami on climate change. "But, from down here, we know the fury that can lurk beneath the cloud cover. And we're finally beginning to realize that we human beings may be contributing to climate changes that could prove catastrophic."
Nelson never has been accused of being a radical environmentalist or an alarmist. Indeed, throughout his political career he has been a voice of moderation.
So when someone like Nelson starts warning that the massive release of carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse" gases into the atmosphere is causing global warming, even the most hard-bitten anti-environmentalists need to take notice.
"Of the 50 states in our nation, Florida is the most vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change," Nelson said. "If the Earth continues to warm up, as scientists predict, our state could suffer relentless heat waves, beaches submerged by rising sea levels, contaminated drinking water, and more severe and damaging hurricanes."
Hurricanes have been the main concern of Nelson's in his insurance commissioner post, to which he was elected in 1994. Many of his waking hours have been spent devising ways to make certain Florida residents and businesses can obtain insurance coverage.
That wasn't a problem until Aug. 24, 1992. On that day, Hurricane Andrew, which developed quickly, slammed into South Dade county. It caused $20 billion in damage and a $16 billion loss to insurance companies. Had the category four hurricane, with sustained winds of 140 mph, hit Miami or Fort Lauderdale, the damage toll could have approached $50 billion.
The 1995 hurricane season, the second busiest in more than a century of record keeping, did nothing to calm fears. Nineteen named storms, including 11 hurricanes, developed in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Two of the hurricanes, Erin and Opal, struck Florida. Opal alone did $3 billion in damage.
And last week, Hurricane Bertha took dead aim at Florida, then turned abruptly and struck points north. As hurricanes go, Bertha ranked in the lower echelon. The scariest thing about Bertha was that it formed off the coast of Africa in early July. These so-called Cape Verde hurricanes aren't supposed to form until late in the month, or in August, after water temperatures have had a chance to really heat up.
The enormously powerful, fast-developing Andrew, the active 1995 hurricane season and the early development of a Cape Verde hurricane aren't proof in and of themselves that the industrial processes of late 20th century society are causing global warming and changing the climate. But they certainly are consistent with the theory.
There are some people, including the Unabomber, who blame technology for the world's problems. They will only be satisfied by the dismantling of industrial society. The technology they scorn, however, could prove to be the world's salvation.
For instance, hydrogen is a clean-burning fuel that some day could replace polluting fossil fuels in cars, airplanes and other vehicles. Hydrogen can be obtained in abundance by separating it from the oxygen atom in water. When burned, it recombines with oxygen and forms water.
The problem is, it takes energy to separate the hydrogen and oxygen in the water molecule, and the technological breakthroughs in the development of solar and other alternative, non-pollutingpower sources that would permit the economical production of hydrogen have not yet taken place.
The key word here is "yet."In the last century, French author Jules Verne, a futurist if there ever was one, predicted the world someday would run on hydrogen. Many of Verne's visions have come to pass, including undersea and space travel, so it would be foolish to bet against his prediction.
Two decades ago, a handful of scientists warned that mankind's industrial activity was raising the Earth's temperature, with potentially disastrous effects. In January, a U.N.-sponsored group of 2,500 climate scientists from throughout the world issued a report drawing the same conclusions.
Now politicians like Nelson are beginning to voice realistic fears of the enormous economic consequences if something isn't done.
Scientists by themselves can't accomplish much. But if industry groups, like insurance, agriculture or tourism, become concerned about the economic impact on their businesses, then maybe we'll see some real mobilization in fighting the problem of global warming.

Full text: THE US
Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan was expected to present an upbeat picture of the US economy in an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee. He also was expected to push for higher interest rates.
The House voted to cancel its pay raises and those scheduled for the vice president, Cabinet, and federal judges. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved about $20 billion for energy and water programs for 1997. The Senate committee also approved a $12.65 billion bill for the Interior Department and other natural resources programs. The spending bills fall short of White House requests. And the House Commerce Committee was to consider a pesticide bill some say would end an unworkable law while still giving protection to infants and children. It would create a single standard for regulating pesticides in foods, ending a multiple-standard system.
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to subpoena Anthony Marceca, a former Clinton White House employee who gathered hundreds of FBI background files on Republicans. Earlier, Marceca refused to testify or to produce documents relating to the case.
White House aide Bruce Lindsey acknowledged during a Whitewater-related trial in Little Rock, Ark., that campaign finance reports didn't fully explain how President Clinton's 1990 Arkansas gubernatorial campaign spent large cash withdrawals. But he denied scheming with the two Arkansas bankers on trial to hide the withdrawals from the IRS.
The Justice Dept. is expected to announce the settlement of a two-year investigation of major Nasdaq dealers. The investigation looked into whether Wall Street firms created artificially high "spreads" between buy and sell prices on Nasdaq stocks.
Time Warner Inc. announced that Federal Trade Commission officials agreed to approve its $7.5 billion purchase of Turner Broadcasting System. The merger will create the world's largest media and entertainment company. FTC commissioners must still vote on the officials' recommendation. The approval is the last major hurdle to completing the deal.
The Clinton administration overruled the Secret Service and granted White House passes to employees with a history of drug use, Secret Service agent Arnold Cole said in an interview with House investigators. A voluntary drug-testing program was set up to allay the service's concerns, he added. A Senate subcommittee plans to hold White House background-checks hearings.
Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian is buying Metro-Goldwyn Mayer Inc. - for the third time. The $1.3 billion deal leaves French bank Credit Lyonnais, which acquired the company through default, with a $700 million loss. While recent hits "The Birdcage" and "Stargate" have helped resuscitate MGM, the studio lost an estimated $159 million last year.
At least five states rejected a Lloyd's of London settlement designed to cut US investors' losses by about $62 million. The states plan to pursue their legal cases against the British insurance market. While Arizona and Utah have regulators that are leaders in the group that negotiated the deal, their refusal won't scuttle it entirely. Lloyd's reported that states representing 84 percent of investors had either signed the deal or agreed to do so.
The US needs the equivalent of the "Manhattan Project" - which developed the first atom bomb - for cyber security, the Clinton administration said. A drive is needed to protect computer networks and critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks, said Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick. Clinton had requested that a blue-ribbon panel recommend measures to safeguard telecommunications, power systems, and water supplies.
The military raised more concerns about racism in its ranks when red swastikas were found on eight doors inside a Ft. Bragg, N.C., Army barracks. Investigators are trying to determine if the vandalism was racially motivated and if someone outside the unit entered the building.
THE WORLD
US envoy Richard Holbrooke said NATO fully endorses the effort to oust Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Holbrooke met with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, the only regional leader strong enough to deliver Karadzic to the UN War Crimes Tribunal. Such a move is unlikely because of a possible backlash by Serbian nationalists. Also, UN investigators excavating a mass grave near Srebrenica have uncovered the remains of 86 people believed to have been killed in last year's massacre. And 50 indicted war criminals are believed to have found sanctuary in the so-called Bosnian Serb Republic, 15 in the Muslim-Croat federation, and three in Yugoslavia, a UN report said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a surprise meeting with Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti - his first with an Arab leader since his election. After the meeting, Kabariti said he was reassured about Netanyahu's commitment to peace. Netanyahu, whose hard-line stance has dismayed Arab leaders, is to meet with Egypt's President Mubarak today. Also, Foreign Minister David Levy said he may meet with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in the next few days. And a German-brokered prisoner swap between Israel and Hizbullah guerrillas was postponed, but may take place today, sources said. Israel is trading 200 prisoners and two Shiite Muslim leaders for the remains of two Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon.
The EU said it may still impose sanctions against the US even though President Clinton imposed a six-month delay on an anti-Cuban bill that would hurt foreign companies.
Talks on the Northern Ireland peace process expanded to London, Strasbourg, and Dublin in an attempt to strengthen peace talks after a week of rioting by both Protestants and Catholics. But chairman George Mitchell of the US said that, despite much name-calling and finger-pointing, the Northern Ireland peace process remains on track.
Chechen rebels accused Russian troops of carrying out attacks on peaceful villages. Both sides scheduled meetings to plan new action in the breakaway republic, which has erupted in new fighting after a shaky seven-week cease-fire. Also, Russian President Yeltsin appointed Gen. Igor Rodionov as the new defense minister. Rodionov, best known for suppressing a pro-independence rally in Soviet Georgia, was new security head Alexander Lebed's first choice. He replaces Gen. Pavel Grachev, who was fired last month.
Three Australian states refused to agree to a ban of semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns, dealing a blow to government efforts to tighten gun laws after April's shooting massacre in Tasmania. Queensland, Northern Territory, and Western Australia proposed, instead of a ban, limiting the capacity of the guns - a move the other states opposed. Under Australia's federal system, gun laws can't be enacted unless all eight states and territories agree.
The time has come to commit to the fight against global warming, the US said at a conference in Geneva. Brushing aside objections by oil-producing countries, the US called for a world targets within 18 months to cap carbon gas emissions caused by burning fossil fuels. The Conference on Climate Change ends today.
The Philippines is allowing about 1,000 Vietnamese boat people to remain indefinitely. Most Asian countries repatriated - often forcibly - the Vietnamese, who fled their home in 1975. UN funding for Vietnamese refugee camps ran out in June.
Recent elections in Albania, won by the ruling Democrats and boycotted by the opposition, don't meet democratic standards, US-backed election monitors said.

"What would happen to these wonderful sale prices: $12.98, $7.99, $5.46? That's supposed to make you think you're paying less than you are actually paying."
-- Consumer Janice Heller Bass of Silver Spring, Md., on a congressional hearing that debated eliminating the penny.
A mystery baffling Washington insiders for months may be solved. The Washington Post says "Anonymous," the best-selling satire of Clinton's 1992 campaign, was written by Newsweek columnist Joe Klein. The Washington Post hired a handwriting expert to compare Klein's writing with notes jotted on the manuscript.
The latest trend among the outrageously hip? Dyeing your hair with Kool-Aid. The neon hair-dye mania is a growing rage among teens and college students, who say the color lasts more than a week, The Wall Street Journal reports.
Before you shell out big bucks for an African hedgehog or Japanese fighting fish, consider the newest pet trend: sugar gliders. The diminutive cousins of the Koala are like miniature flying squirrels. But price isn't proportional to size: The chipmunk-sized pets average $225 apiece.
THE DAY'S LIST
Pennypinching Reps
The 10 most frugal House office spenders last year, according to the National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan group. Reps receive a spending allowances for geographical variations in office rent and travel costs to and from Washington. Republicans made up 38 of the 50 most frugal spenders, but the top pennypincher was Democrat Andy Jacobs of Indiana. If all House members had spent as little as Jacobs, office spending would have been slashed 35 percent.

Full text: Bill Clinton, the US president, is expected to give the go-ahead for the enforcement on August 1 of the most controversial part of the so-called Helms-Burton law, which seeks to curb foreign investment in Cuba in the face of broad international condemnation. He would do this by not exercising a waiver clause delaying for six months the implementation of Title III, under which US claimants of properties nationalised in Cuba would be able to sue foreign firms judged to be "trafficking" in them. Most analysts believe Mr Clinton, in an election year, will not exercise the waiver to avoid being accused by Republican opponents of being "soft" on communist Cuba.
Dalai Lama visits Britain
The Dalai Lama visits London at the invitation of the Tibet Society and 27 UK Buddhist organisations. Britain was apparently asked by China to cancel the trip but refused. China has been particularly touchy about the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader and Nobel peace prize winner, since last month - when Germany's Bundestag adopted a resolution condemning Chinese human rights abuses in Tibet. China's official media has accused the Dalai Lama of trying to "split the motherland".
Clinton 's successor resigns
Jim Guy Tucker, who succeeded Bill Clinton, the US president, as governor of Arkansas, resigns his office following his conviction - along with two of Mr Clinton's former partners in the Whitewater property venture - for fraud. During the trial of Mr Tucker, who is appealing, the president testified as a defence witness. Meanwhile Bruce Lindsey, one of Mr Clinton's closest aides, has been named a co-conspirator in the trial of two Arkansas bankers accused of illegally using bank funds to reimburse themselves for contributions to political candidates - including Mr Clinton.
Lloyd's holds annual meeting
Lloyd's of London , the insurance market fighting to make a comeback after making losses of more than £8bn, holds its annual meeting at the Royal Festival Hall in London. It seeks support for its recovery plan, which includes a £3.1bn out-of-court settlement offer to Names. There will also be an extraordinary meeting called by some Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - who want extra benefits for the hardest hit. Lloyd's hopes the rebel motions will be defeated easily and that it will win strong backing for the plan, which Names would have until August 28 to accept.
US/Albanian manoeuvres
US and Albanian troops start a week of joint military manoeuvres code-named "Peaceful Eagle". Albania, whose new government was sworn in last week after controversial elections, was the first country to join Nato 's Partnership for Peace. It has been a base for US reconnaissance flights over Bosnia during the last few years of war and ethnic cleansing in former Yugoslavia. The US sees Albania as a stabilising force in a volatile region.
EU tackles Turkey deadlock
EU foreign ministers try to break the deadlock over aid to Turkey caused by a longstanding Greek veto. Ministers will also assess progress on a bilateral accord with Switzerland, the Middle East peace process and human rights in Burma. In Strasbourg, the European Parliament holds a plenary session at which, on Wednesday, the Irish presidency will set out its plans for the next six months.

MPs in UK armed forces vote
British MPs have their first and only chance to vote on the government's £1.5bn privatisation of 58,000 armed forces married quarters. The opposition Labour party is holding a debate on the sale, which it claims is a bad deal for the taxpayer and for families of serving personnel. More than 20 Conservative MPs also have reservations about the measure. Although the vote is not binding on the government, a defeat could force ministers to make concessions which would make the sale less attractive to the four shortlisted private-sector bidders.
India police report on bribes
India's Central Bureau of Investigation , the country's equivalent of the FBI , presents a progress report into the so-called hawala political bribes scandal, in which 25 top politicians from all parties - including seven former Congress party ministers - have been charged. Last week two state governors were also charged in India's broadest corruption scandal since independence. It revolves around alleged payments by Surendra Jain, a Delhi-based businessman. The latest charged, the state governors and a former minister, appear in court this week.

Kohl in official Austria trip
Helmut Kohl's biannual holidays in Austria's Salzburg region may have become a feature of the German political calendar, but the chancellor is going on his first official state visit there since 1984. The trip includes a stop at the Hungarian border to thank residents who helped the first East Germans escaping eastern Europe through the barbed wire fence.
British shadow cabinet votes
MPs from Britain's Labour party vote on whether to bring the annual shadow cabinet elections forward to July 24, instead of the usual date in October. Tony Blair, party leader, wants the contest now in order to avoid distractions in the run-up to a general election. He is likely to get his way. Some Labour MPs want to use the election to punish Harriet Harman, shadow health secretary, for sending her son to a grammar school. Mr Blair has persuaded a number of bright young allies not to stand - in the hope that Ms Harman will retain her place.
UN Hiroshima conference
The United Nations opens a conference on nuclear and conventional weapon disarma-ment in Hiro-shima, the target of the world's first atom bomb attack 51 years ago. The opening session will be addressed by Yukihiko Ikeda, the Japanese foreign minister (to July 19).
US/Japan insurance talks
The US and Japan open two days of talks in Tokyo in an attempt to resolve a dispute over access to the Japanese insurance market before the end of the month. Unusually, the US is anxious about the consequences of a proposed Japanese deregulation measure - rather than playing its habitual role of calling for fewer government regulations.
Lisbon in Portuguese push
The Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) , embracing more than 170m people, is launched in Lisbon. The CPLP aims to endow Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal and Sao Tome and Principe with more cultural, diplomatic and economic weight than they might have individually. An equally important motive appears to be an effort by Portugal to assert a cultural influence increasingly under threat in its former colonies. Last year, for example, Mozambique became a full member of the English-speaking Commonwealth.

Tube strike in London
A complete shutdown of the London Underground is expected when Tube train drivers who are members of the RMT transport union and Aslef , the drivers' union, go on strike for 24 hours. Some trains have run in the previous strikes because Aslef members make up only three-quarters of the Tube workforce. Now the two groups intend to co-ordinate. Eight more one-day strikes are planned if talks with management fail. The drivers want a one-hour cut in their basic working week and say London Transport has reneged on a deal.

Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, delivers his half-yearly "Humphrey Hawkins" monetary testi-mony to Congress. He will unveil the Fed 's latest economic projections and monetary targets. Investors will be listening closely for hints about the outlook for short-term interest rates. Following signs of accelerating economic growth, many analysts expect the Fed to raise rates at its August 20 meeting, if not before. Fears of higher rates have already prompted sharp falls in US share and bond prices.

Olympic Games start in US
One hundred years after their revival in Athens, the Olympic Games open in Atlanta, Georgia, US. On view: a record 10,788 competitors in 26 sports. Big talking point: will China, which is desperate to host the Olympics early next century, edge closer to the top of the medal winners' table? Big problem: Atlanta's ferociously humid summer weather, which is expected to penalise many teams, including northern European ones. Big pay-off: record Olympic cash flows, especially for television broadcasters (to Aug 4).

Japan implements a 200-mile economic zone around its shores, under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea. This highlights two territorial disputes over islands included in the zone which are jointly claimed with China (Senkaku or Diaoyutai) and South Korea (Takeshima or Tokdo). Both are in the middle of rich fishing grounds. All sides have set aside the squabble - for the moment - and are instead discussing fishing rights.

Full text: A GROUP of 58 international insurance companies yesterday called on governments of industrialised nations to achieve "early substantial reductions" in greenhouse gas emissions.
"We are worried about climate change because it is likely to cause more extreme weather events," Dr Andrew Dlugolecki of General Accident said at international talks in Geneva on the 1992 climate change convention. "We are losing increasing amounts of money through extreme weather." It is estimated that a single hurricane in the United States could set the global insurance industry back by $50 billion pounds 33 billion).
United Nations officials are delighted that a group normally known for its conservatism has joined the environmental cause. "When a major industry such as the insurance sector starts to worry, so should we," says Elizabeth Dowdeswell, the executive director of the UN Environment Programme.
British insurance companies are already facing payouts of pounds 500 million each year after a series of droughts. "A bad year of drought can cost millions of pounds in damage to house foundations," says Dr Dlugolecki.
The problem is not just the cost of severe weather: insurers are also affected by the increasing unpredictability of weather.
"The fluctuations in the amount paid for weather damage by insurance companies each year are becoming greater," says Ivo Knoepkel from the Zurich-based Swiss Reinsurance Company. Unpredictability makes it more difficult for insurers to work out the level of premiums.
Insurance companies admit that global warming does produce some benefits: there is expected to be a decline in claims relating to frost damage.

Full text:   FOSSILIZED: Powerful lobby groups representing fossil-fuel interests work vigorously to deny evidence that human activity is contributing to global warming -- but their efforts may be beginning to backfire.
Over the 10 years since world leaders first seriously began to tackle climate change, some of the planet's most sophisticated lobbyists have been employed to obstruct the process. However, there are signs of a backlash against this corporate anti-social behavior.
This week's crucial climate talks in Geneva have 150 countries discussing the next stage for the Climate Change Convention, and the plans to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases that are basically causing the problem.
For those who have attended the dozens of scientific meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and parallel political gatherings, the fossil-fuel lobby has been a constant burden as it strives to preserve its own short-term interests at all costs.
Scientists have finally concluded that human activities are having a discernible effect on the climate. And they have concluded there is no more legitimacy in the argument that there is still enough scientific uncertainty to warrant delay in action.
So if we are to stop the predicted catastrophe to our world, the fossil-fuel economy faces obsolescence, and the lobbyists know it. They represent what Merylin McKenzie Hedger, of the World Wide Fund for Nature, calls optimistically ``death row industries.'' There is still a lot of obstruction left in them, but it is matched by signs that they will not be allowed to get away with it much longer. Scientists, environmentalists, and businesses, notably insurance, are resisting.
Hedger says: ``People seem shocked that these industries are prepared to sacrifice our children's future so they can continue to make money now. But that is blatantly what they are doing.''
The giants of the lobbying business are the vast Global Climate Coalition, registered as a non-government organization, an ``NGO,'' with the same status at the talks as Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature, and the very green Climate Change Network. (Note the name similarities.)
The GCC is prepared to talk to journalists. It has a reasonable-sounding mission statement, which involves ``co-ordinating'' business participation in the scientific and policy debate on change.
So far it refuses to accept the IPCC science and says there is an ``open question'' about climate change. Its membership has roots in American business, and outside the talks, its main activities are convincing the U.S. Congress that action against global warming is bad for business and should not be taken until the middle of the next century at the earliest.
The membership roll contains multi-national corporations high on any environmentalists' top 10 most unpopular companies. There are the oil giants, Shell, Texaco, Exxon, British Petroleum, Amoco, Chevron and Mobil. Then there is the coal industry, the American automobile manufacturers, electric companies and the Air Transport Association. Other members, all big power users, are manufacturers of aluminum and plastics, Dow chemicals, and our old friend Union Carbide of Bhopal fame.
Contrarian science
These groups spend heavily not just on lobbying but on scientists -- not the mainstream kind, but what are known as ``contrarians.'' Their work is legitimate science but unorthodox -- they are often in a minority of one. Yet the lobby group gives them immense backing and publicity out of all proportion to their weight.
For example, Frederick Seitz was given prime space in the authoritative Wall Street Journal to attack all 1,000 scientists who had spent five years examining all possible evidence on climate change. Seitz is not a climate scientist himself, nor part of the IPCC process, yet he describes minor changes in the text of the scientists' report (intended to make it clearer) as a corruption of the process, ``an attempt to deceive policy makers and the public into believing that the scientific evidence shows human activities are causing global warming.''
He was attacking the single truth that the fossil-fuel lobby hates most -- that global warming is already here. Five years' work had concluded just that, but Seitz was given space to attack this and call for an abandonment of the whole project. Seitz is chairman of the George C. Marshall Institute in Washington, which has appeared in GCC documents before.
The insurance industry is beginning to fight back, and has told the International Chamber of Commerce, which until recently also ignored climate change, to become more neutral or lose powerful friends and members.
There are signs that even the administration in Washington is beginning to grow impatient with the industrial lobby. Eileen Clausson, leading for the U.S. administration at the climate talks, said: ``They are a very strong group of people who muddy the science. We call them the Naysayers.''
Environment groups, once frightened by being labelled scaremongers, are finding more courage, and the WWF is playing tougher and calling on companies like BP, which claim to be environmentally friendly and have a solar power division, to resign from the GCC.
``If they don't, we shall know where they really stand,'' Hedger says. ``Any claim of BP to care about the environment, while supporting this kind of underhand behavior, is hypocritical.''

Full text:   TENS OF thousands of British homeowners whose houses are built on clay have already felt the impact of global warming. Their insurance bills are up six-fold because the foundations of their homes are shrinking.
People on America's gulf coast feel it too: they are suffering more frequent hurricanes and have to pay more for their insurance as a result.
And millions of people in low-lying parts of developing countries can no longer get insurance at all.
The insurance industry accepts that global warming is already taking its toll. Others in business disagree.
The world's insurers have warned the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that they face financial ruin because of the havoc wreaked by climate change. Insurers now regard global warming as having arrived. So do scientists on the UN Climate Change panel, who say manmade climate change is now 'discernible'.
But more powerful voices still deny global warming exists, or that it is a problem. Millions of pounds are still being spent to convince politicians that there is nothing to worry about.
The Global Climate Coalition, as this group styles itself, represents the fossil fuel lobby. It fears climate change is bad for business.
Such groups realised early that calls for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions could cause serious disruption to the coal and oil industries. Lined up with them are other heavy users of power, including the automobile industry.
With 150 countries gathering in Geneva for the second 'conference of the parties' to decide the next steps to combat global warming, the stage is set for a clash of the world's two biggest industry groups.
It has taken a long time for the insurance industry to realise that its future is threatened by climate change. Now though, 60 of the world's biggest insurance companies have formed a group to counter the fossil-fuel lobbyists. At the talks, the UN panel and the new insurance lobby will hold a seminar to 'educate' politicians about the dangers the world faces because of climate change.
Reinsurance group Swiss Re was the first to wake up to the need for counter-propaganda. In a booklet to be presented to politicians it states that the more quickly and radically the climate changes, the more extreme will be the damage.
This would pose a threat not only to individual citizens, families and enterprises but also to whole cities and branches of the economy - even entire states and social systems. 'In brief,' it says, 'it is damage which had better not be risked because it can no longer be handled.'
Rudolf Kellenberger, a member of the executive board, said: 'Human intervention in the natural climatic system could accelerate global climatic change to such an extent that society might no longer be able to adapt quickly enough.'
The Climate Coalition, which includes Shell, BP, Exxon and Ford, claims the scientists are going over the top and says there is as yet no proven need to do anything.
The group has most of the American Congress on its side and is seriously hampering the US delegation's freedom to negotiate new targets for greenhouse gas emissions.
The insurance companies have one weapon up their sleeves which so far they have not used, though they realise its power. They are big investors in the companies trying to sabotage the climate change negotiations. If they switched their funds from oil to solar energy, that could really change the world.

Full text: The fossil-fuel lobby will be out in force next week, trying to convince 150 countries that mounting evidence of global warming is a lot of hot air.
Over the 10 years since world leaders first seriously began to tackle climate change, some of the planet's most sophisticated lobbyists have been employed to try to obstruct the process.
Crucial talks beginning Monday in Geneva have 150 countries discussing the next stage for the Climate Change Convention, and the plans to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases. Those attending will encounter more lobbying, but there are signs of both a political and business backlash against it.
Those who have attended the dozens of scientific meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the parallel political gatherings, have grown used to encountering the fossil fuel lobby.
As scientists and politicians try to agree internationally on addressing the greenhouse gas problem, there are men in suits making objections -- they interrupt every meeting, stalk delegates in coffee bars and corridors, all to delay, obscure and if possible stop action.
In the last few months, scientists have finally concluded human activities are having a discernible effect on the climate. And they have concluded there is no more legitimacy in arguing there is still enough scientific uncertainty to warrant delay in action.
But action against global warming threatens the future of the fossil fuel economy, and the lobbyists know it. They represent industries on ``death row,'' says Merylin McKenzie Hedger of the World Wide Fund for Nature.
There is still a lot of obstruction left in them, as the Geneva talks will show, but matched by signs that scientists, environmentalists, and businesses, notably insurance, are ready to resist.
Hedger says: ``People seem shocked these industries are prepared to sacrifice our children's future so they can continue to make money now. ''
There have been two main groups of lobbyists. One is run by an American lawyer, Don Pearlman, who has repeatedly challenged the wording of documents, removing as much certainty as possible from the scientific consensus designed to guide politicians. He has repeatedly objected to graphics that illustrate best to politicians with little time what is happening.
While Pearlman refuses to say directly whom he represents, his links with oil-producing states are obvious by the company he keeps: he is mainly seen with representatives from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Approached by the Guardian newspaper about his purposes, he will not even say ``no comment.''
But the giants of the lobbying business are the vast Global Climate Coalition, registered as a non-government organization, with the same status at the talks as Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature, and the very green Climate Change Network.
The coalition has a reasonable sounding mission statement which involves ``co-ordinating'' business participation in the scientific and policy debate on change.
So far it still refuses to accept the international panel's science and says there is an ``open question'' about climate change. Its membership has roots in American business, and outside the talks, its main activities are convincing the U.S. Congress that global warming is bad for business and action should be delayed until at least the middle of the next century.
The coalition's membership roll contains multi-national corporations high on any environmentalists' top 10 most unpopular companies. There are the oil giants, Shell, Texaco, Exxon, British Petroleum, Amoco, Chevron and Mobil.
Then there is the coal industry, the American Automobile Manufacturers, Ford and General Motors, electric companies, and the Air Transport Association. Other members, all big power users, are manufacturers of aluminium and plastics; Dow chemicals and Union Carbide.
These groups spend heavily not just on lobbying but on scientists -- not the mainstream kind, but what are known as the ``contrarians.''
Their work is legitimate science but unorthodox -- they're often in a minority of one. Yet they're given immense backing and publicity out of all proportion to their weight by the lobby group.
For example, Frederick Seitz was given prime space in the authoritative Wall Street Journal to attack all 1,000 scientists who had spent five years examining all possible evidence on climate change. Seitz is not a climate scientist himself, nor part of the international panel process, yet he describes minor changes in the text of the scientists' report (intended to make it clearer) as a corruption of the process, ``an attempt to deceive policy makers and the public into believing that the scientific evidence shows human activities are causing global warming.''
He was attacking the finding the fossil-fuel lobby hates most -- that global warming is already here. Five years' work had concluded just that, but Seitz was given space to attack this and call for an abandonment of the whole project.
Dr. Benjamin Santer of the prestigious Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the scientists Seitz named in his piece, said it would be a ``tragedy'' if such an attack was to destroy the work of so many scientists.
Meanwhile, the insurance industry is beginning to fight back. It has told the International Chamber of Commerce, which until recently also ignored climate change, to become more neutral or lose powerful friends and members.
There are signs that even the administration in Washington is beginning to grow impatient with the powerful industrial lobby. Eileen Clausson, leading the U.S. delegation at the climate talks, said: ``They are a very strong group of people who muddy the science. We call them the Naysayers.''

Full text:   If global warming occurs, large portions of Florida, Louisiana and other low-lying parts of the world from Bangladesh to Bimini could sink someday beneath rising oceans. If that happens, future generations will confront a range of problems that stagger the mind.
A brief list of those problems suggests horrifying consequences: tropical diseases infesting humans and livestock in formerly temperate latitudes; catastrophic property losses and staggering insurance claims in densely developed coastal communities; stronger and more numerous hurricanes and typhoons; drastically diminished crop and forest yields; sharp reductions in fisheries production.
Those outcomes are based on ideas that scientists worldwide gradually came to accept and, now, more rapidly embrace. Their meaning in Florida's future was the topic of a town hall meeting convened in Miami recently by Dade County and some environmental groups.
The participants included Tim Wirth, a former Colorado senator who is undersecretary of state for global affairs; Florida Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson; and Dr. Paul Reiter of the Centers for Disease Control.
Global warming is the presumed effect on the world's climate of increasing emissions of carbon dioxide and other combustion gases that form an atmospheric blanket that prevents heat from escaping the Earth.
The latest reference for informed discussion of the phenomenon is a collection of reports prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPCC is a United Nations study group that has condensed the response to global warming of 2,500 climatologists and other scientists from 150 nations. Their consensus:
* Global warming is real.
* The condition is exacerbated by the combustion of fossil fuels and other human activities.
* Coping with global warming will require international cooperation and concerted change of lifestyles in developed and developing nations.
Yet there are scientists who remain skeptical. They accuse their cohorts of embracing the latest scientific theory as a means of attracting and extending research funding.
One of the most prominent critics is Richard S. Lindzen, a professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who sealed a reputation for brilliance with his election at the tender age of 37 to the National Academy of Sciences.
Lindzen recently told the New York Times that the theory of global warming is "bunk," claiming that fatal flaws infest the essential computer models. He said that those mistakes distort the scientific principles underlying their design. Lindzen said a key assumption that atmospheric water vapor will exacerbate global warming is based on principles of physics that might not prevail in the upper atmosphere.
Another scientific critic whose name may be familiar to Herald-Tribune readers is hurricane prognosticator William Gray of Colorado State University. Gray's predictions of Atlantic hurricane frequency and intensity, based on various climatic vectors, have been remarkably accurate.
Gray called Lindzen's outspoken views "courageous" and said he agrees with Lindzen's reasoning. Gray claims that many older scientists are skeptical about global warming but remain silent because they fear professional criticism and funding losses.
So, the scientific debate on global warming has become a political hot potato. That's unfortunate because the public and policy-makers need unbiased scientific information so they can make prudent, informed and cost-effective decisions on everything from land uses to energy supplies.
While scientists continue their debate, it makes sense to adopt strategies that, while they could help prevent global warming, make sense because of the energy efficiencies realized. For example:
* Adopt international accords to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
* Implement commercial-scale, renewable energy production - an effort which will require time and billions of dollars to accomplish.
* Raise gasoline taxes and fuel efficiencies of cars and light trucks, which are responsible for about 20 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.
* Educate consumers to use more energy efficient appliances and lighting in homes and offices.
Useful as these strategies would be, they may not be enough to prepare Americans - and, in particular, Floridians - for the predicted effects of long-term global warming. That's why it's imperative for the scientific community to provide the most objective information possible concerning global warming. If the threat is real, significant steps must be taken, and there is little time to waste.

Our warming world's hot war: Is the fossil-fuel industry leading a counter-attack on the science and warnings of climate change? On the eve of a world gathering to review plans to limit the emission of greenhouse gases, one writer says yes.: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: For those who have attended the dozens of scientific meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the parallel political gatherings, the fossil-fuel lobby has been a constant burden. As scientists and politicians try to agree internationally on addressing the greenhouse problem, men in suits make objections -- they interrupt every meeting, stalk delegates in coffee bars and corridors, all to delay, obscure and if possible stop action. Their perseverance and dedication, backed by unlimited resources, show the importance of their mission to preserve the short-term interests of the fossil-fuel lobby at all costs. So if we are to stop the predicted catastrophe to our world, the fossil-fuel economy faces obsolescence, and the lobbyists know it. They represent what Merylin McKenzie Hedger, of the World Wide Fund for Nature, calls optimistically ``death row industries.'' There is still a lot of obstruction left in them, as the Geneva talks will show, but matched by signs that they will not be allowed to get away with it much longer. Scientists, environmentalists, and businesses, notably insurance, are resisting.

Full text:   Over the 10 years since world leaders first seriously began to tackle climate change, some of the planet's most sophisticated lobbyists have been employed to try (and often succeed) to obstruct the process.
Next week in Geneva, 150 countries will discuss the next stage for the Climate Change Convention and plans to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases. Those attending will encounter more black propaganda, although there are signs of both a political and business backlash against this corporate behavior.
For those who have attended the dozens of scientific meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the parallel political gatherings, the fossil-fuel lobby has been a constant burden.
As scientists and politicians try to agree internationally on addressing the greenhouse problem, men in suits make objections -- they interrupt every meeting, stalk delegates in coffee bars and corridors, all to delay, obscure and if possible stop action. Their perseverance and dedication, backed by unlimited resources, show the importance of their mission to preserve the short-term interests of the fossil-fuel lobby at all costs.
In the last few months, scientists have finally concluded that human activities are having a discernible effect on the climate. And they have concluded there is no more legitimacy in the argument that there is still enough scientific uncertainty to warrant delay in action.
So if we are to stop the predicted catastrophe to our world, the fossil-fuel economy faces obsolescence, and the lobbyists know it. They represent what Merylin McKenzie Hedger, of the World Wide Fund for Nature, calls optimistically ``death row industries.'' There is still a lot of obstruction left in them, as the Geneva talks will show, but matched by signs that they will not be allowed to get away with it much longer. Scientists, environmentalists, and businesses, notably insurance, are resisting.
Hedger says: ``People seem shocked that these industries are prepared to sacrifice our children's future so they can continue to make money now. But that is blatantly what they are doing.''
There have been two main groups of lobbyists. One is run by an American lawyer, Don Pearlman, who has repeatedly challenged the wording of documents, removing as much certainty as possible from the scientific consensus designed to guide politicians. He has repeatedly objected to graphics which illustrate best to politicians with little time what is happening.
While Pearlman refuses to say directly whom he represents, his links with oil-producing states are obvious by the company he keeps: he is mainly seen with representatives from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Approached by the Guardian about his purposes, he will not speak, even to say ``no comment.''
But the giants of the lobbying business are the vast Global Climate Coalition, registered as a non-government organization at the meeting, with the same status at the talks as Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature, and the very green Climate Change Network. (Note the name similarities.)
The GCC is prepared to talk to journalists. It has a reasonable sounding mission statement which involves ``co-ordinating'' business participation in the scientific and policy debate on change. So far it still refuses to accept the IPCC science and says there is an ``open question'' about climate change. Its membership has roots in American business, and outside the talks, its main activities are convincing the U.S. Congress that global warming is bad for business and action should not be taken until the middle of the next century.
The membership roll contains multinational corporations high on any environmentalists' top 10 most unpopular companies. There are the oil giants, Shell, Texaco, Exxon, British Petroleum, Amoco, Chevron and Mobil. Then there is the coal industry, the American Automobile Manufacturers, Ford and General Motors, electric companies, and the Air Transport Association. Other members, all big power-users, are manufacturers of aluminum and plastics. Then there's Dow Chemicals and Union Carbide of Bhopal fame.
These groups spend heavily not just on lobbying but on scientists, not the mainstream kind -- but what are known now as the ``contrarians''. Their work is legitimate science but unorthodox -- they are often in a minority of one. Yet they are given immense backing and publicity out of all proportion to their weight by the lobby group.
For example, Frederick Seitz was given prime space in the authoritative Wall Street Journal to attack all 1,000 scientists who had spent five years examining the evidence on climate change. Seitz is not a climate scientist himself, nor part of the IPCC process, yet he describes minor changes in the text of the scientists' report (intended to make it clearer) as a corruption of the process, ``an attempt to deceive policy makers and the public into believing that the scientific evidence shows human activities are causing global warming''.
He was attacking the single truth that the fossil-fuel lobby hates most -- that global warming is already here. Five years' work had concluded just that, but Seitz was given space to attack this and call for an abandonment of the whole project. Seitz is chairman of the George C. Marshall Institute in Washington, which has appeared in GCC documents before.
Seitz named in his piece Benjamin Santer, from the prestigious Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Santer was shocked at such an attack and said it would be a ``tragedy'' if it was to destroy the work of so many scientists.
Sir John Houghton, former head of the UK's Meteorological Office and co-chair of Working Group 1 of IPCC, who is not inclined to florid language, described the attack as scurrilous. And Seitz's piece was only one of many which have appeared in the U.S. and elsewhere. The journal Nature was not fooled and accused the GCC of bad behavior.
The insurance industry is beginning to fight back, and has told the International Chamber of Commerce, which until recently also ignored climate change, to become more neutral or lose powerful friends and members.
There are signs that even the administration in Washington is beginning to grow impatient with the powerful industrial lobby. Eileen Clausson, leading for the U.S. administration at the climate talks said: ``They are a very strong group of people who muddy the science. We call them the Naysayers.''
Environment groups, once frightened by being labelled scaremongers, are finding more courage and the WWF is playing tougher and calling on companies like British Petroleum, which claim to be environmentally friendly and have a solar power division, to resign from the GCC. Hedger says: ``Any claim of BP to care about the environment, while supporting this kind of underhand behavior, is hypocritical. We shall be calling on them to withdraw their membership and support from GCC. If they don't we shall know where they really stand.''

Abstract: Britain will experience changes in climate during the next 25 years which will have the effect of moving the country more than 100 miles south. In 2020, it will be as though Manchester has moved to Oxford. According to a government report published yesterday, tourism and leisure industries are expected to boom, especially in southern England, but the Scottish ski industry may be wiped out by lack of snow. Most aspects of national life will be affected, creating a range of winners and losers. Home heating bills may fall because demand for fuel is expected to drop by 3 per cent, but water bills may rise sharply in southern England to pay for new reservoirs as demand soars.

Full text: Britain will experience changes in climate during the next 25 years which will have the effect of moving the country more than 100 miles south. In 2020, it will be as though Manchester has moved to Oxford.
By 2050 we may prefer Britain's beaches to those of the uncomfortably hot Mediterranean, but our health is likely to suffer. Droughts will increase across the most densely populated and intensively farmed parts of the country.
According to a government report published yesterday, tourism and leisure industries are expected to boom, especially in southern England, but the Scottish ski industry may be wiped out by lack of snow.
Most aspects of national life will be affected, creating a range of winners and losers. Home heating bills may fall because demand for fuel is expected to drop by 3 per cent, but water bills may rise sharply in southern England to pay for new reservoirs as demand soars.
"Summer droughts are forecast to be more severe and frequent in the south," says the report.
The main benefits of global warming fall on forestry, where tree plantations will grow more quickly; on cattle and sheep grazing in a warmer and wetter Scotland and northern England; and in tourism and recreation.
But it is expected to have a net adverse effect on soil erosion, wildlife, the insurance industry, health, water supplies and crop-farming in the Midlands, southern England and Wales.
The 270-page document, written by a panel of 22 experts, was launched by John Gummer, Secretary of State for the Environment, in advance of international negotiations on combating global warming in Geneva later this month.
Mr Gummer hopes it will increase pressure on governments of wealthy nations like Britain - which have produced the lion's share of 'greenhouse emissions' - to pledge themselves to curbing pollution in the first 10 years of the millennium.
"Unless we act now, the consequences outlined in this report will cost us and our children dear in the future, " he said.
The report examines the impact of climate change in 2020 and 2050, based on the latest forecasts from the Meteorological Office's Hadley Centre. The government-funded centre in Bracknell, Berkshire, is one of a handful around the world using supercomputer simulations to predict how the atmospheric build-up of heat- trapping gases will alter air and sea temperatures, currents, winds, rain and snowfall.
There is now a consensus among climate experts that the 0.75 degrees C rise in global average temperatures over the past century will be man- made.
Average UK temperatures are expected to be about 0.9 C higher than the 1961-1990 average by 2020, and 1.6 C higher in 2050. While total annual rainfall is predicted to increase by 5 per cent by 2020 and 10 per cent by 2050, summer rainfall is expected to decline over most of England and Wales.
The report points out that three of the five warmest years in the Met Office's 337-year Central England Temperature Record occurred in the past 10 years - 1989, 1990 and 1995. The summers of 1976 and 1995 were the warmest ever recorded in England.
However, Britain should not be affected by the spread of tropical diseases, such as malaria, dengue and leishmaniasis, which are carried by insects and thrive in warm conditions. But food-borne and water-borne diseases, which cause diarrhoeal and dysenteric infections are "likely to spread more readily in warmer and wetter conditions," says the report.
Wildlife species living on semi-Arctic mountain tops, such as the ptarmigan and snow bunting, may disappear from a warmer Britain, along with their habitat. The brown trout, which needs cold water in its life cycle is also likely to decline.
Many beech trees and "street trees", planted along the pavements of towns and cities, are expected to fall victim to the hotter, drier summers in the southern half of Britain.
Sea levels in southern England will be two feet higher in 2050, although they will be much lower in the north - the southern half of the UK was already sinking before global warming expanded the oceans.

DISASTERS: Stormy weather will cost us more Rachel Baird on the insurers' problems with our changing world

Author: Baird, Rachel

Abstract: IT HAS not been a good week for insurers. Way before the start of the hurricane season, two ripped into Mexico; bush fires destroyed hundreds of houses in the southwest US, where it is so dry after years of drought that some towns have banned smoking outdoors; and massive early floods hit India and Bangladesh. Evidence of global warming? Perhaps, say the world's more forward-looking insurers, who despair of motor and energy industry lobbyists denying the evidence that human-induced climate change has started. For the first time, four insurers, representing 60 major companies, will attend next week's meeting on climate change as official observers, out of self-interest. Frank Nutter, president of the Reinsurance Association of America recently warned the US Senate that climate change could bankrupt the industry. Claims for weather-related disasters have risen from $16 billion for all the 1980s to $48 billion for just the first half of the 1990s, according to reinsurance giant Munich Re. While not all of this is due to wilder weather, some insurers are convinced the weather has changed for the worse, and others fear it will do. One of the four insurers in Geneva will be Dr Andrew Dlugolecki - an assistant general manager at the UK's General Accident insurance company and a world expert on insurance and climate change. He wrote the relevant chapter for the IPCC. "We don't want to lose a lot of money, and we have lost a lot in some big incidents, such as storms," says Dlugolecki.

One of the four insurers in Geneva will be Dr Andrew Dlugolecki - an assistant general manager at the UK's General Accident insurance company and a world expert on insurance and climate change. He wrote the relevant chapter for the IPCC. "We don't want to lose a lot of money, and we have lost a lot in some big incidents, such as storms," says Dlugolecki.
His reading of the science is that there will in future be more extreme weather events - such as droughts and floods - costing insurers money. This is shared by leading US climatologists at the Goddards Institute of Space Studies, who this week announced that 1995 was the hottest year since records began in 1866 and have predicted another record year by the end of the century. Right on cue, the Worldwatch Institute in Washington announced carbon emissions rose to record highs, too.
Insurers are taking action to limit the cost of storms, floods and subsidence (although they do not necessarily link these directly with climate change). They are raising premiums to cover themselves against the costs of bad weather and some are even refusing to provide insurance in the riskiest parts of the world, such as the hurricane-prone Caribbean.
Hurricane Andrew in 1992 is estimated to have caused total losses of $25 billion in Florida, equivalent to the combined losses of the previous three most costly US storms, according to Christopher Flavin of the US Worldwatch Institute. This sort of severe weather in a rich, urban area most scares insurers. They are also scared that if climate patterns really are changing they cannot rely on their records to tell them accurately about probabilities. The huge US insurer Allstate is even now reassessing catastrophe protection because it was taken out before Hurricane Andrew.
Weather-related events have almost doubled the cost to consumers of household buildings insurance in the UK over the last 20 years, says Dlugolecki. And over the last 10 years insurers have started charging more in areas prone to subsidence, where before everyone paid the same for cover against subsidence. Insurers have also funded careful studies of sea defences and of flooding and storm damage across the UK, to help them charge property insurance rates which accurately reflect risks. This means greater inequality in what people pay. "You're beginning to see a complete shift in the old stability in the household marketplace," says Dlugolecki.
Some insurers will pull out of "high hazard" areas of the UK altogether; some will stay. They are going to charge "a fairly differentiated price" (ie a high one) to those unlucky enough to live in an area prone to floods, storm damage or subsidence. The "differentiated price" may be so high that there is effectively no insurance available.
Could insurers use climate change as an excuse to make us all pay more? This is "a valid question", says Dlugolecki, but he argues that the market is so competitive that it would be impossible (not to mention illegal) to run a cartel. Someone would always undercut the insurers who charged high premiums.
Meanwhile, the director of Greenpeace's Solar Initiative, Jeremy Leggett, is working on channelling banks' and insurers' funds into the solar power industry. Whatever Leggett thinks of the insurers' motives for being in Geneva, he is helping them put their money where their mouths are.

Abstract: Next week's crucial climate talks in Geneva have 150 countries discussing the next stage for the Climate Change Convention, and the plans to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases which are basically causing the problem. Those attending will encounter more black propaganda: but there are signs of both a political and business backlash against this corporate anti-social behaviour. For those who have attended the dozens of scientific meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the parallel political gatherings, the fossil fuel lobby have been a constant burden. As scientists and politicians try to agree internationally on addressing the greenhouse problem, there are men in suits making objections - they interrupt every meeting, stalk delegates in coffee bars and corridors, all to delay, obscure and if possible stop action. Their perseverance and dedication, backed by unlimited resources, show the importance of their mission to preserve the short term interests of the fossil fuel lobby at all costs. But the giants of the lobbying business are the vast Global Climate Coalition, registered as a non-government organisation, an "NGO", with the same status at the talks as Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature, and the very green Climate Change Network. (Note the name similarities.) The GCC is prepared to talk to journalists. It has a reasonable sounding mission statement which involves "co-ordinating" business participation in the scientific and policy debate on change. So far it still refuses to accept the IPCC science and says there is an "open question" about climate change. Its membership has roots in American business, and outside the talks, its main activities are convincing the US Congress that global warming is bad for business and action should not be taken until the middle of the next century at the earliest.

Full text: OVER THE 10 years since world leaders first seriously began to tackle
climate change, some of the planet's most sophisticated lobbyists have been employed to try (and often succeed) to obstruct the process.
Next week's crucial climate talks in Geneva have 150 countries discussing the next stage for the Climate Change Convention, and the plans to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases which are basically causing the problem. Those attending will encounter more black propaganda: but there are signs of both a political and business backlash against this corporate anti-social behaviour.
For those who have attended the dozens of scientific meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the parallel political gatherings, the fossil fuel lobby have been a constant burden. As scientists and politicians try to agree internationally on addressing the greenhouse problem, there are men in suits making objections - they interrupt every meeting, stalk delegates in coffee bars and corridors, all to delay, obscure and if possible stop action. Their perseverance and dedication, backed by unlimited resources, show the importance of their mission to preserve the short term interests of the fossil fuel lobby at all costs.
In the last few months, scientists have finally concluded that human activities are having a discernable effect on the climate and there is no more legitimacy in the argument that there is still enough scientific uncertainty to warrant delay in action.
So if we are to stop the predicted catastrophe to our world, the fossil fuel economy faces obsolescence, and the lobbyists know it. They represent what Merylin McKenzie Hedger, of the World Wide Fund for Nature, calls optimistically "death row industries." There is still a lot of obstruction left in them, as the Geneva talks will show, but matched by signs that they will not be allowed to get away with it much longer. Scientists, environmentalists, and businesses, notably insurance, are resisting.
Hedger says: " People seem shocked that these industries are prepared to sacrifice our children's future so they can continue to make money now. But that is blatantly what they are doing."
There have been two main groups of lobbyists. One is run by an American lawyer, Don Pearlman, who has repeatedly challenged the wording of documents, removing as much certainty as possible from the scientific consensus designed to guide politicians. He has repeatedly objected to graphics which illustrate best to politicians with little time what is happening. While Pearlman refuses to say directly who he represents, his links with oil-producing states are obvious by the company he keeps: he is mainly seen with representatives from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Approached by the Guardian about his purposes, he will not speak, even to say no comment.
But the giants of the lobbying business are the vast Global Climate Coalition, registered as a non-government organisation, an "NGO", with the same status at the talks as Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature, and the very green Climate Change Network. (Note the name similarities.) The GCC is prepared to talk to journalists. It has a reasonable sounding mission statement which involves "co-ordinating" business participation in the scientific and policy debate on change. So far it still refuses to accept the IPCC science and says there is an "open question" about climate change. Its membership has roots in American business, and outside the talks, its main activities are convincing the US Congress that global warming is bad for business and action should not be taken until the middle of the next century at the earliest.
The membership roll contains multi-national corporations high on any environmentalists' top 10 most unpopular companies. There are the oil giants, Shell, Texaco, Exxon, British Petroleum, Amoco, Chevron and Mobil. Then there is the coal industry, the American Automobile Manufacturers, Ford and General Motors, electric companies, and the Air Transport Association. Other members, all big power users, are aluminium manufacturers, plastics, Dow chemicals and our old friend Union Carbide of Bhopal fame.
These groups spend heavily not just on lobbying but on scientists, not the mainstream kind - but what are known now as the "contrarians". Their work is legitimate sciencebut unorthodox - they are often in a minority of one. Yet they are given immense backing and publicity out of all proportion to their weight by the lobby group.
FOR example, Frederick Seitz was given prime space in the authoritative Wall Street Journal to attack all 1,000 scientists who had spent five years examining all possible evidence on climate change. Seitz is not a climate scientist himself, nor part of the IPCC process, yet he describes minor changes in the text of the scientists' report (intended to make it clearer) as a corruption of the process, "an attempt to deceive policy makers and the public into believing that the scientific evidence shows human activities are causing global warming".
He was attacking the single truth that the fossil-fuel lobby hates most - that global warming is already here. Five years' work had concluded just that, but Seitz was given space to attack this and call for an abandonment of the whole project. Seitz is chairman of the George C Marshall Institute in Washington, which has appeared in GCC documents before.
Seitz named in his piece Dr Benjamin D Santer, from the prestigious Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Santer was shocked at such an attack and said it would be a "tragedy" if it was to destroy the work of so many scientists. Sir John Houghton, former head of the UK's Met Office and co-chair of Working Group 1 of IPCC, not inclined to florid language, described the attack as "scurrilous." And Seitz's piece was only one of many which have appeared in the US and here. The journal Nature was not fooled and accused the GCC of bad behaviour.
Interestingly, the insurance industry is beginning to fight back, and has told the International Chamber of Commerce, which until recently also ignored climate change, to become more neutral or lose powerful friends and members. There are signs that even the administration in Washington is beginning to grow impatient with the powerful industrial lobby. Eileen Clausson, leading for the US administration at the climate talks said: "They are a very strong group of people who muddy the science. We call them the Naysayers."
Environment groups, once frightened by being labelled scaremongers, are finding more courage and the WWF is playing tougher and calling on companies like BP, which claim to be environmentally friendly and have a solar power division, to resign from the GCC. Hedger says: "Any claim of BP to care about the environment, while supporting this kind of underhand behaviour, is hypocritical. We shall be calling on them to withdraw their membership and support from GCC. If they don't we shall know where they really stand."

Full text: Global warming will widen the UK's climatic gap between the wet north and the dry south, a government review body warned yesterday.
The UK Climate Change Impacts Review Group , an independent scientific panel reporting to the Department of the Environment , predicts that the north and west of the country will become even wetter over the next half-century, with more flooding.
The south and east will become drier with frequent droughts. The climate of the London area in 2020 will be similar to that of the Champagne or Loire regions of France today; by 2050, it will be similar to Bordeaux's.
Professor Martin Parry, of University College London , who chaired the group, said some industry sectors would benefit from these changes but a larger number would lose out.
Likely beneficiaries include tourism and recreation; forestry - with a predicted 15 per cent increase in timber yields; and some farming in upland regions.
There is a longer list of losers. Farmers in most of England will suffer from soil erosion and reduced crop yields. Some plant and animal species will find it difficult to adapt as climate zones move northwards by 200km over the next 30 years, and some, such as rare ferns, may become extinct. There may also be health problems if, for example, insect-borne diseases become established in the warmer conditions.
The insurance industry is vulnerable, the report says. The cost of weather-related claims has been rising rapidly since the mid-1980s, and drought-related subsidence, storms and flooding will all lead to many more claims over the next few decades.
The review predicts an increase in the average UK temperature from 9C to 10.6C by 2050. At the same time, global sea level will rise by 35cm, causing problems in low-lying regions.
The group's first report on climate change in the UK, published in 1991, was a relatively sketchy document that gave vague predictions of what might happen in the middle of the next century. This second report is a much fuller and more confident analysis.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said the review "is based on a wide consensus among our scientific experts that climate change will have an increasing impact". He attacked those who "refused to believe the evidence before them".
The review panel had deliberately refrained from being alarmist, Mr Gummer said. "We cannot rule out the possibility of a surprise - for example, that climate change could produce changes in the circulation of the Gulf Stream, which would make things very different indeed."
Mr Gummer said he would call, at a UN -sponsored conference on climate change in Geneva next week, for further cuts in the emissions of "greenhouse gases" - mainly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels - by developed countries. UK emissions are expected to be 4 per cent to 8 per cent below 1990 levels by 2000, he added.
Mr Charles Secrett, director of the environmental group Friends of the Earth , called the report "the best analysis yet of the potentially devastating impact of global warming on UK agriculture and water resources, human health and wild species and habitats".
Greenpeace was more hostile. "The climate is changing but policies aren't," said Mr Douglas Parr, the group's climate campaigner. "The government is doing pathetically little in the face of this massive ecological threat."

It's true: there really are more disasters than there used to be

Abstract: The world really is becoming a more dangerous place. An authoritative report published today documents an alarming worldwide increase in floods, hurricanes, storms and other climatic catastrophes over the last few years. Losses from such "weather-related disasters" in the 1990s are so far running at six times the level of the 1980s, says the report, by Washington's prestigious Worldwatch Institute. And, it says, this may just be "a preview of things to come", as global warming takes hold. "During the past five years," says the report, "the world has experienced unprecedented damage from weather-related disasters". It calculates that they cost the world $162bn (pounds 105bn) during the first half of the 1990s, compared to just $54bn for the entire decade of the 1980s, which means that the rate of damage has jumped sixfold.

Full text: And the next victim may be the insurance industry.
The world really is becoming a more dangerous place. An authoritative report published today documents an alarming worldwide increase in floods, hurricanes, storms and other climatic catastrophes over the last few years.
Losses from such "weather-related disasters" in the 1990s are so far running at six times the level of the 1980s, says the report, by Washington's prestigious Worldwatch Institute. And, it says, this may just be "a preview of things to come", as global warming takes hold.
Insurance firms, who have seen their payouts soar in parallel with the costs of the catastrophes, are warning that the trend could "bankrupt" their industry. They are so concerned that a worldwide alliance of more than 50 companies will next week issue an unprecedented appeal to governments at international negotiations in Geneva to cap emissions of the pollution that causes the climatic change.
"During the past five years," says the report, "the world has experienced unprecedented damage from weather-related disasters". It calculates that they cost the world $162bn (pounds 105bn) during the first half of the 1990s, compared to just $54bn for the entire decade of the 1980s, which means that the rate of damage has jumped sixfold.
Between 1990 and 1995 the world suffered 16 climatic catastrophes that each cost more than $3bn: up to 1987 there had never been a disaster that cost even as much as $1bn.
These include:
A 170 mph cyclone that hit Bangladesh in May 1991, killing 140,000 people and damaging or destroying more than a million homes. The cost, $3bn, was more than 10 per cent of the country's gross national product.
Hurricane Andrew, the most expensive disaster ever, which virtually flattened more than 160 square miles of Florida in August 1992. Losses reached $30bn, equivalent to the cost of the three previously most expensive US storms put together.
The 1993 flooding of the Mississippi, and the 1994 Italian floods, which cost $12bn and $9.3bn respectively.
Floods in China and North Korea in 1995, which together caused damage worth $21.7bn.
Christopher Flavin, Vice President for Research at the Worldwatch Institute and one of the authors of the report, said last week: "We keep expecting things to return to normal, but they don't. We thought this might be happening in the early part of last year, but then the Asian floods pushed the figures right back up again." It was also one of the worst ever years for hurricanes in the Atlantic, and in the end the year set a new record for disaster losses.
"This has now gone beyond the level at which it could be a simple anomaly," Mr Flavin added. "It is such a sharp change, happening right across the globe, that there really seems to be something happening to the climate."
The report stops short of blaming global warming for the disasters so far, but says that it is likely to cause more of them in future. Recent studies had concluded that "the coming period of rapid climate change is likely to be erratic, disruptive and unpredictable". It is backed by the latest report of the official Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, representing the consensus of more than 2,000 leading scientists, published this month, which says that "the incidence of floods, droughts, fires and heat outbreaks is expected to increase in some regions" as temperatures rise.
Some scientists believe that the warming could greatly increase the power of hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons, producing winds of up to 220mph. One leading insurance expert has predicted that it could even cause Caribbean hurricanes to reach as far north as New York.
The insurance industry has already been badly shaken by Hurricane Andrew. Its costs wiped out seven US insurance companies and the then director of the US National Hurricane Centre estimated that if Andrew had strayed just a little further north, it would have hit Miami and New Orleans, causing damage of $100bn - more than half the capital of all the property and casualty insurance companies in the country.
Franklin Nutter, president of the Reinsurance Association of America, warns: "The insurance industry is first in line to be affected by climate change. . . It could bankrupt the industry." HR Kaufmann, general manager of Swiss Re, one of Europe's largest insurers, adds: "There is a significant body of scientific evidence indicating that last year's record insured loss from natural catastrophes was not a random occurrence. Failure to act would leave the industry and its policyholders vulnerable to truly disastrous consequences."
Now 56 insurance companies are about to add their weight to calls for strengthening the international treaty to combat climate change, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio four years ago. Next week they will urge governments meeting in Geneva to review the treaty and put a ceiling on emissions that cause global warming.

FLORIDA ENDANGERED BY WARMING: [ALL EDITIONS.=.SUNDAY]

Abstract: State Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson sees steamy Florida in particular danger from heat waves that kill crops, wipe out tourist beaches, and contaminate drinking water. Global warming also might bring a greater possibility of more frequent and deadlier hurricanes. [Timothy Wirth] says some experts believe that global warming already has spurred more hurricanes. Last year was the busiest Atlantic hurricane season in 60 years, with 19 named storms in the United States killing 121 people and causing $7.7 billion worth of damage. Another concern is the spread of disease. The last global warming occurred naturally in the 14th century, spawning some of mankind's worst plagues, Wirth said.

Full text: Monstrous hurricanes. Deadly tropical diseases. Barrier islands swallowed by the sea.
These scenarios are no mythical future but a real possibility for Florida and nearby states if global warming continues because of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, the U.S. undersecretary of state for global affairs said last week.
"The international scientific community is saying, `This is happening. Hey, pay attention. This could have disastrous consequences,'"
said Timothy Wirth, in Miami to speak to scientists at the Town Hall Meeting on Climate Change and Florida's Future.
Not everyone agrees with the doom-and-gloom prognosis. Dissenting scientists have said that the data are inconclusive and that unpopular measures such as energy taxes to cut consumption are unnecessary.
Still, last month's report by the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change said that if emissions from fossil fuels continue at current levels, the Earth will warm by as much as 6 degrees Fahrenheit in the next century.
"There is now overwhelming agreement in the scientific community that as carbon goes up, we can see temperatures starting to go up," Wirth said.
This century, sea levels have risen as much as 14 inches in some places.
The greenhouse effect is a thin layer of atmosphere that works as a thermostat. Not enough greenhouse effect and heat bounces off a planet the way it does on frigid Mars, too much and it cooks like Venus.
An estimated $2 trillion worth of insured properties along coasts in the United States could be put in jeopardy if sea levels continue to rise, Florida officials say.
"Florida and Louisiana are most vulnerable because they are not only very, very low, but they are very much in violent storms'
paths," said Wirth, who was a Colorado congressman and senator from 1974 to 1990.
State Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson sees steamy Florida in particular danger from heat waves that kill crops, wipe out tourist beaches, and contaminate drinking water. Global warming also might bring a greater possibility of more frequent and deadlier hurricanes.
Wirth says some experts believe that global warming already has spurred more hurricanes. Last year was the busiest Atlantic hurricane season in 60 years, with 19 named storms in the United States killing 121 people and causing $7.7 billion worth of damage.
Another concern is the spread of disease. The last global warming occurred naturally in the 14th century, spawning some of mankind's worst plagues, Wirth said.

Full text: Florida is the state with the most to lose from global warming.
As the planet warms, ice in Antarctica will melt and make sea levels rise, damaging coastal property. Climate change also could cause stronger hurricanes, said Bill Nelson, Florida treasurer and insurance commissioner.
"We're the most vulnerable to damage caused by climate change," said Nelson, speaking at a meeting on Thursday to call attention to climate change.
About 90 people, many environmental activists, attended the meeting at the Hotel Intercontinental. The meeting was sponsored by Dade County and several environmental organizations.
Panelist after panelist spoke of a bleak future resulting from the greenhouse effect. Scientists think gases spewed into the air when fossil fuels are burned trap heat, warming the Earth.
Such global warming could have drastic effects, changing weather patterns around the planet.
While global warming has been the subject of debate in the scientific community for more than a decade, an international panel of scientists recently concluded that human activity is having a "discernible effect" on climate.
"There is an international consensus," said Timothy Wirth, the U.S. undersecretary of state for global affairs. Wirth, a former senator from Colorado, will be the chief negotiator in international meetings aimed at cutting the production of gases blamed for causing the greenhouse effect.
One way that global warming could affect the planet is through the melting of polar ice caps, raising sea levels around the planet.
"We have sort of warmed the ocean of the Earth's atmosphere, and you know we're going to be melting the ice," said Hal Wanless, a geology professor at the University of Miami. "There's plenty of ice left to melt."
Wanless said sea levels had been fairly steady for about 1,000 years. But since about 1930, the sea level in Key West has risen about 8 inches, Wanless said.
"The rate of rise we have right now is catastrophic, as far as I'm concerned," Wanless said.
Up to $2 trillion in property on the U.S. coastline - including about $1 trillion in Florida - could be damaged by rising sea levels, Nelson said.
Global warming also could affect people's health, said Paul Reiter, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As the planet warms, the areas that support disease-carrying mosquitoes could increase in size.
"It's quite conceivable that with a few degrees change in the climate, could give rise to epidemics of tropical dieseases," Reiter said.
Wirth said the international negotiations, which start next month, are the most complex in which the United States have ever been involved. More than 180 countries will participate.
To be successful, any agreement must cover the interests of the 40 to 60 island nations whose existence is threatened by rising sea levels, as well as oil-exporting states that aren't eager to curb the use of fossil fuels.
Developing countries such as China, India and Brazil, are concerned that international agreements on global warming will curb their growth, Wirth said.
Measures to cut emissions could include taxes on fossil fuels or incentives to use alternative fuels. But Wirth didn't give concrete actions that the United States would like to see put into effect.
He views his job as educating the public and creating a consensus among politicians. "You've got to get people on board," Wirth said.

Full text: MIAMI - If you think summers are miserably hot and wet now, stick around.
Things are going to get worse. Maybe a lot worse.
So warned the 100 or so environmentalists, scientists, politicians and bureaucrats who gathered Thursday at Miami's Hotel Intercontinental for a "town hall meeting" on global warming.
They had catastrophes in mind: superstrong hurricanes, rising seas, swamped beaches, salty water supplies and swarming mosquitoes.
"The potentially catastrophic impacts of global warming cannot be contained after the fact," said Bill Nelson, Florida's insurance commissioner. "We need to pursue policies now to reduce pollution that can cause global warming."
The solutions? Sharp reductions in the burning of fossil fuels for electricity and transportation, all seemed to agree. Their efforts face stiff opposition from utilities and automobile manufacturers, among others.
"We're facing an uphill battle because a lot of the powers are against us," said Harvey Ruvin, Dade County, Fla.'s clerk of courts and the leader of the county's effort to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases. "That's why we need to take local action to demonstrate that people really care about this."
Sponsored by several environmental groups and Dade County's Department of Environmental Resource Management, the meeting was the first in a national series on climate change. Conservationists hope to drum up support for inevitable higher fuel prices and energy conservation measures they say would prevent devastating changes to the earth's atmosphere.
A United Nations scientific panel released a report recently concluding that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are most likely responsible for changes in the world's climate. The report predicted a rise in global temperatures of 1.8 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100 and outlined potentially devastating environmental and health hazards the warming would bring.
Global temperatures rose a half to 1 degree Fahrenheit in the last century. The two warmest years on record were 1990 and 1995.
Seas are already rising here at an accelerated - and alarming - rate, said Harold Wanless, a University of Miami marine geologist. Waters have risen 8 inches since 1930 along Florida's southern Atlantic and Gulf coasts, he said, compared to a 3-inch rise the previous century.
The immediate impact of rising sea level is seen first on the beach. For every foot the sea rises, 60 to 100 feet of the shore vanishes, according to federal and state scientists.

Abstract: Scientists at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale have found evidence of five Mayan towns in Guatemala, including a port city used by the Spanish to build a ship in their conquest of the Mayans. The towns are located in the Central American nation's Peten region, about 40 miles from the more famous classic Mayan city in Tikal. Spanish explorers and missionaries came to the region in the 1500s and 1600s. "Natives here resisted Spanish influence more than a hundred years after the rest of the Mayan people had fallen under Spanish control," said Don Rice, director of SIU's Center for Archaeological Investigations. "We're eager to discover new things about a time and a native people we didn't know much about before."

Scientists at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale have found evidence of five Mayan towns in Guatemala, including a port city used by the Spanish to build a ship in their conquest of the Mayans.
The towns are located in the Central American nation's Peten region, about 40 miles from the more famous classic Mayan city in Tikal. Spanish explorers and missionaries came to the region in the 1500s and 1600s.
The elaborate Mayan society in Peten collapsed about 800 A.D., but survivors continued farming in the region.
"Natives here resisted Spanish influence more than a hundred years after the rest of the Mayan people had fallen under Spanish control," said Don Rice, director of SIU's Center for Archaeological Investigations. "We're eager to discover new things about a time and a native people we didn't know much about before."
Rice found the cities with the help of several researchers, including his wife, Prudence Rice, chair of the university's anthropology department. Another researcher, Grant Jones of Davidson College, in Davidson, N.C., found evidence of the cities in the journals of Spanish priests and conquerors in archives in Spain.
The SIU scientists found the settlement sites during preliminary field excavations over the past two summers. They will dig more deeply during the next few summers.
"We hope to uncover structural foundations, fortifications and artifacts," said Prudence Rice. "At the port, we expect to find a lot of the Spaniards' shipbuilding tools, nails, kitchen utensils and the remains of meals."
The research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation.

Rare Plants Like Gold
Next time you take an aspirin for a headache, think of the 14 species of willow trees threatened with extinction in the United States.
A chemical found in willow trees was key to developing aspirin, consumed at the rate of some 80 million pills a day. A new study by St. Louis researchers says endangering willows and hundreds of other rare U.S. plants also endangers the economic benefits that plants bring Americans.
The study, by the Center for Plant Conservation, shows that 80 percent of rare U.S. plants have close relatives that - like the willow - are economically useful. Relatives of food crops alone are worth about $10 billion a year in wholesale farm values, conclude Oliver Phillips and Brien Meilleur.
Meilleur is president and executive director of the center and Phillips is a scientist at the University of Leeds, in England. The center is located at the Missouri Botanical Garden.
The results of the study "surprised the heck out of us," said Meilleur. "It shows that if we continue to consume the plant diversity around us, we're losing the potential to develop new crops and other economic plants of the future.
"It's like we're losing an insurance policy that protects our own survival."
Many crops require occasional infusions of genetic material from close wild relatives. These infusions supply such useful features as improved nutritional value, disease resistance or more hardiness when confronted with climate change. They include common Midwestern crops as well as such crops as almonds, grapes, sunflowers, walnuts, roses, beans, squashes and cherries.

Full text:   For six decades, weather observers at Logan International Airport would look to the sky once an hour, 24 hours a day, and check a bank of gauges and dials, gathering the latest information to feed to meteorologists.
But earlier this spring, the Logan weathermen were replaced by machines. At the airport, as at scores of sites nationwide, a $4.5 billion National Weather Service overhaul is deploying automated sensors to do the work of the human observers.
The new machines, which continuously collect information on temperature, wind speed, precipitation and barometric pressure, are yielding a trove of new data for the Weather Service and forecasters who rely on it. By next fall, the project will quintuple the number of sites reporting weather conditions 24 hours a day in southern New England, potentially improving forecasts greatly.
However, the move has broken up a century-old set of Boston snowfall and sunshine records, upsetting some climatologists and private meteorologists. They say the new measuring devices are erratic and likely to generate faulty data, undermining studies of climate change.
"The electronic gadgets don't do the job as well, and they can't measure snowfall," said Robert Lautzenheiser, a retired state climatologist and monthly Globe contributor, who continues to maintain records at his Reading home.
Weather Service officials admit the automated stations are not perfect and have bugs that still need to be worked out. "From a forecasting perspective, it has been a net gain for us, but there are some things a machine can't replicate," said Robert M. Thompson, meteorologist-in-charge at the Weather Service's Taunton office. It oversees Massachusetts, Rhode Island and nearby parts of New Hampshire and Connecticut.
The great plus, Thompson said, is that the project will vastly increase the number of places around southern New England where weather conditions are monitored around the clock -- from five to 24 when the last sites are outfitted next summer -- giving weather forecasters a much fuller picture of regional weather flow.
The Automated Surface Observing System, as the machines are known, has proven a controversial part of a generally acclaimed $4.5 billion effort by the Weather Service, Defense Department and Federal Aviation Administration to upgrade government forecasting and storm monitoring. Nationwide, it includes 161 new radars, several satellites and super-powerful computers.
Across the country, 850 of the observation units are being installed, replacing many staffed offices. In this region, automated units over the last year have replaced manned stations at Logan, Worcester, T. F. Green (Providence) and Bradley International airports (Springfield).
Federal budget cuts, as well as a demand for better information, are driving the move toward automated stations, Thompson said. No one has been laid off because of automation, but several people have been reassigned and some jobs left unfilled when people retired, Thompson said.
Previously, weather observations were reported by a person who read various dials and devices once an hour, more often during severe weather. Round-the-clock observations for the Taunton office region came from just five spots: the three big international airports and the Otis and Westover air bases on Cape Cod and in western Massachusetts. A few other airport locations provided data only during daylight hours.
The new stations -- installed mostly over the last year at about $100,000 each -- comprise several computerized devices linked by telephone to Taunton that measure wind direction and speed, temperature, dew point, barometric pressure, type and amount of precipitation, cloud condition and visibility.
Eleven are in service, nine are due to go on line by fall, and the last four next summer. Massachusetts units include sites in Chatham, New Bedford, North Adams, Orange and Plymouth, where the Weather Service had never before monitored conditions.
Although the machines handle basic data well, they lag humans in many ways, critics and agency officials are agreed. They can only see cloud cover up to 12,000 feet; they rely on observing just one part of the sky to estimate visibility and fog; and they sometimes cannot tell snow from sleet or freezing rain.
Pilots' groups, weather service employee unions and Congress' General Accounting Office have all criticized aspects of the system's performance. Service officials say they are continually making improvements through a normal "shakeout" period, and FAA contractors are replacing people at airports like Logan.
The automated facilities measure snowfall by melting it into the same device that measures rainfall, then multiplying by 10 to estimate snow depth. But that method can be way off, according to Lautzenheiser and climatologist David Taylor of Weather Services Corp. in Bedford, because the heated machine evaporates snow before it gets counted and because some snow exceeds the 10:1 ratio.
The volunteer observers the Weather Service will increasingly rely on for snowfall totals are often less accurate than professionals, they said.
Another record that has been lost in the changeover is monthly reports of Boston's total sunshine, a number that has been compiled since the 1890s and is useful, for example, to people interested in solar heating, said David Spiegler, president of DBS Associates in Billerica, a meteorological consulting firm. The new machines cannot yet count that figure.
Alan Dunham, who oversees the automated devices in southern New England, said the agency is working on those criticisms.
"With any technology, there are continuous improvements," Dunham said. Dunham, a 13-year Weather Service veteran, said, "It's not perfect, but it's really exceeding my expectations, and it'll still get better."
The new network could also complicate the Port Authority's $2 million snow-plowing insurance policy at Logan International Airport, which is based on official Weather Service snowfall measurements that no longer will be made. Weather Service meteorologists were removed in April and replaced with private contractors paid by the FAA.
One question is whether the change could affect the insurance policy Massport holds that provides reimbursement, up to $2 million, for snowplowing costs if snowfall exceeds a projected level. The contract language specifies it must be based on the count by the Weather Service at Logan. With this winter's record snowfall, that policy saved Massport more than $1 million.
As of April, the FAA took over weather observation at Logan using contract employees, meaning snowfall records next winter would not officially be Weather Service reports.
Jeremy Crockford, spokesman for Massport executive director Stephen P. Tocco, said, "We're not worried. We're confident we can work something out with the insurer as a means to measure the snowfall."
FAA spokeswoman Arlene Salac said contractors at Logan "will continue to take snow measurements as they have in the past" -- a surprisingly simple process of using a ruler on a hedge-shielded bench behind the old weather service station.

Abstract: The 5,021 people registered as Green in New Mexico still short of 1 percent of the state's registered voters have a choice between veteran environmentalist Sam Hitt of Santa Fe and Abraham Gutmann of Albuquerque, who has been a leader of the Green Party since its inception in New Mexico. Both Hitt, 48, and Gutmann, 42, say a contested Senate primary is not a ploy to attract more attention to the Greens, who made waves statewide in 1994 when Roberto Mondragon's candidacy for governor attracted about 11 percent of the vote. Hitt, who was raised in suburban Detroit, said he grew up around talk of forestry and natural resources his father worked for the Forest Service for a time and his Oregon uncle was a fisherman. Hitt came to Santa Fe in 1968 to attend St. John's College.

In its first election year as an officially designated major political party, New Mexico's upstart Green Party finds itself with not one but two candidates for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Republican Pete Domenici.
The 5,021 people registered as Green in New Mexico still short of 1 percent of the state's registered voters have a choice between veteran environmentalist Sam Hitt of Santa Fe and Abraham Gutmann of Albuquerque, who has been a leader of the Green Party since its inception in New Mexico.
Both Hitt, 48, and Gutmann, 42, say a contested Senate primary is not a ploy to attract more attention to the Greens, who made waves statewide in 1994 when Roberto Mondragon's candidacy for governor attracted about 11 percent of the vote.
Both said they came to the decision to run for Senate separately. And Hitt noted ruefully that if the goal was to attract the spotlight, "we haven't got a bit of attention yet" a situation that could improve for the Green nominee come the fall general election, when the presidential race promises to put politics on the front burner.
"We did not discourage people from running," said Steve Cabiedes, the Greens' Bernalillo County chairman. "We felt like it was healthy to have a contested primary, to promote debate and interest."
There also is an issue in the background that has split some Greens Hitt's involvement in an anti-logging lawsuit that spurred restrictions on home-use wood gathering by Northern New Mexico villagers living near the Carson National Forest. At a protest of the wood-gathering restrictions last year, Hitt was hanged in effigy. Mondragon attended the event.
"Just like in the rest of the state, it's an issue that cuts across groups even within our own party," said Cabiedes, a Hitt supporter who emphasizes he'll back whoever wins the primary.
Gutmann, in an interview, did not raise the logging lawsuit as an issue, although when asked he said he probably would have handled the suit differently than Hitt did.
Hitt says he hasn't found the controversy coming up often in the campaign. "Some people are contrary to my campaign because of that issue, but it's mainly people who don't know me," Hitt said. "I've spent a lot of fence-mending time."
Hitt, director of the Santa Fe-based Forest Guardians group, said the Forest Service was to blame in the dispute, "practicing divide and conquer tactics" against environmentalists and rural Hispanics. He said the Forest Service had failed to come up with a sustainable plan to provide for firewood needs.
Gutmann, who was born in Chicago and was active in the anti-war movement in the 1970s, moved to New Mexico in 1988 after 15 years outside the country. He lived and studied in Egypt, Cyprus, Turkey and Syria and traveled in South America. Gutmann said that during his years abroad, he published a series of books on spiritual topics.
While living in Taos, he helped found the New Mexico Green Party. He ran as a Green candidate for the state Legislature in 1992, was active in Mondragon's 1994 gubernatorial campaign and said he's registered 2,500 Green voters himself. Gutmann has a wholesale clothing business, gives private lessons in Arabic and Turkish and is pursuing a bachelor's degree in Spanish at The University of New Mexico.
"The primary reason I'm running is to bring the benefits of true multiparty democracy to this country," Gutmann said. He said the Republicans and Democrats are bankrolled by the same big-money interests.
"They agree with each other on big issues but they're always attacking each other," Gutmann said. "It's poisoned the atmosphere in Washington."
Gutmann calls for a major national effort, equivalent to the Apollo space program, to curtail the country's dependence on oil and other fossil fuels and solving the problems of global climate change.
He also said the country should move toward "more human friendly" housing and development patterns. "The whole pattern now is based on automobile dependency," he saR>id.
Gutmann supports decriminalization of drug possession. He said locking up people for drug use is overcrowding the criminal justice system and amounts to "a violation of civil liberties." On health care, he favors a "single payer" approach that takes insurance companies out of the system. He has set a limit of $250 for campaign contributions.
Hitt, who was raised in suburban Detroit, said he grew up around talk of forestry and natural resources his father worked for the Forest Service for a time and his Oregon uncle was a fisherman. Hitt came to Santa Fe in 1968 to attend St. John's College.
After graduation, he did forestry and agricultural work for the Jicarilla Apaches and with La Clinica de La Gente near Tierra Amarilla. He began his environmental advocacy work in the early 1980s with legal action that helped end the Forest Service's use of DDT for pest control. He founded Forest Guardians in 1988 and the group waged a long but successful fight against logging on Elk Mountain north of Pecos.
Forest Guardians is now active in environmental causes throughout the Southwest, "bringing law and science to bear" on forest and habitat preservation issues.
Despite Forest Guardians' success, Hitt said one reason he's running for senator is "a sense that we're losing the war private money from elite interests are undermining our democracy." He said he supports campaign reform to limit contributions and spending and provide more public financing "so that a third party candidate has a chance."
Hitt said another major issue for him is "the growing disparity" between rich and poor. "I would propose the end of `wealth-fare' as we know it by eliminating tax breaks and subsidies and other benefits for corporations." He also would provide tax breaks and other incentives to businesses that provide profit-sharing and reduced work weeks to employees.
On the environment, Hitt supports jail time for executives of polluting companies. "Kind of a three strikes and you're oR>ut for repeat polluters," he said. He also would support a German-style program to require manufacturers to take back and recycle old appliances and cars as much as possible. On grazing, he would support buying out ranchers who have permits to graze on public lands.
"If we're going to clear cut old growth," Hitt said, "let's start with Pete Domenici."

Abstract: Most capitalistic countries - European Community, Australia, Canada, Japan, etc. - practice various forms of enlightened capitalism. Compared with the U.S. none has our wealth, resources or productive capabilities; yet their workers do better than ours when it comes to benefits: health care, sick leave, vacation, workplace respect, safety and retirement security. Also, only in the U.S. is government maligned as a "too big" enemy, when in fact, relative to GNP we spend less (except for "defense," where we outspend all our allies combined), tax less, and provide fewer services for workers and their families. Corporate U.S.A., gone global, is far from enlightened. Instead, we have a short-sighted, bottom-line driven culture that sees more profits as the only measure of success, regardless of the long-term social and economic effects on our nation as a whole. Theirs is a dog-eat-dog, winner-take-all ethic that regards cooperation, compromise, and compassion as losers. Trickle-down Reaganomics resulted in the biggest increase in our national debt since we became a nation, and led to the decline in the standard of living for most working Americans. Today, Dan Miller and his GOP Contract cohorts insist on more of the same: less taxes for the rich, the difference being made up on the backs of the elderly, poor and disabled. While far from perfect, President Clinton has given us three years of deficit reduction, a down-sized government that is more efficient with fewer regulations. Under his administration we have seen a steady growth in the economy without inflation, a drop in unemployment, and an increase in jobs, although too many have been at minimum wage, which should be corrected. The nation's crime rate is down and progress has been made in curbing illegal immigration and drugs coming from abroad.

Full text:   Far from `enlightened'
GOP defenders of Congressman Dan Miller and "enlightened capitalism," please note ( letter, May 7).
Most capitalistic countries - European Community, Australia, Canada, Japan, etc. - practice various forms of enlightened capitalism. Compared with the U.S. none has our wealth, resources or productive capabilities; yet their workers do better than ours when it comes to benefits: health care, sick leave, vacation, workplace respect, safety and retirement security. Also, only in the U.S. is government maligned as a "too big" enemy, when in fact, relative to GNP we spend less (except for "defense," where we outspend all our allies combined), tax less, and provide fewer services for workers and their families.
Corporate U.S.A., gone global, is far from enlightened. Instead, we have a short-sighted, bottom-line driven culture that sees more profits as the only measure of success, regardless of the long-term social and economic effects on our nation as a whole. Theirs is a dog-eat-dog, winner-take-all ethic that regards cooperation, compromise, and compassion as losers. Trickle-down Reaganomics resulted in the biggest increase in our national debt since we became a nation, and led to the decline in the standard of living for most working Americans. Today, Dan Miller and his GOP Contract cohorts insist on more of the same: less taxes for the rich, the difference being made up on the backs of the elderly, poor and disabled.
The fact is, when it comes to "freeloaders," corporate U.S.A. - from agriculture to defense - receives more of our tax dollars than do the poor.
While far from perfect, President Clinton has given us three years of deficit reduction, a down-sized government that is more efficient with fewer regulations. Under his administration we have seen a steady growth in the economy without inflation, a drop in unemployment, and an increase in jobs, although too many have been at minimum wage, which should be corrected. The nation's crime rate is down and progress has been made in curbing illegal immigration and drugs coming from abroad. The president has done a remarkable job in the use of the power of his office in cooling tempers, which has made peace possible in some of the world's most troublesome areas. All this, despite hostile, vindictive, personal attacks by Congress.
Come November, voters should reject Dan Miller's "Restoring the Dream," which is nothing but a baked-over version of the GOP failed "contract." Americans who want to see our nation enter the 21st century prepared to lead - because our children are better educated, computer-trained, and know how to get along and solve problems through cooperative team efforts - should support the president.

A foster mom, and glad of it
Four years ago, I made a decision that has profoundly changed my life. I chose to become a foster parent. I wanted to make a difference in someone's life.
My own children were grown and they were supportive. I enrolled in the special course, filled out reams of paperwork, had several home visits, was fingerprinted, had a visit from the Health Department, confirmed that I had committed no felonies, and, oh yes, my family, friends and business associates became my references. All of this to take care of someone else's child.
The kids who come into our home have been neglected or abandoned, physically, emotionally, or sexually abused or their parents have been incarcerated. For whatever reason, their parents haven't been able to provide them with a safe, loving home.
These kids look like yours or mine on the outside, but on the inside, their world has fallen apart or disappeared. They don't know why they feel like they do and often, they can't explain it.
I have watched a 7-year-old blossom like a flower, her confidence and self-esteem growing because of the help she gets to recover from her abuse. There's an 8-year-old boy who would rather run away than go to sleep each evening because of things that happened to him in the night.
These kids don't deserve the abuse; they have the right to a safe, loving childhood and foster families strive to provide that. Am I making a difference? I dearly hope so.
Being a foster mom has taught me patience and understanding. I have opened my heart and my home to these special children of our community. Please think of us with kindness.

Global risk is real
A recent issue of your always fine newspaper was truly exceptional. Waldo Proffitt's report on the recent ManaSota-88 workshop was outstanding. As he says, global warming as a result of human activity may be questioned by a few scientists, but most evidence indicates it is real. The main point is that without any doubt, the risk is real. And the consequences would be horrendous.
We must do all we can to reduce human activities that contribute to climate change. That means turning to the solar solution in every way and as soon as possible. It certainly means thumbs down on such dirty, polluting fuel as Orimulsion.
Another article in the same edition tells what happens when polluting industry is crammed into a small area with millions of people, their garbage and lead-laden car exhaust (Cairo is the example, but it is one of many). You also included a report on "Vital Signs 1996," published by Worldwatch, that says our planet is in deep trouble in spite of a few good trends. Several items in the "Earthweek Diary" attest to that.
Should we care that frogs and toads are declining alarmingly in Yosemite National Park? Yes. Their decline and other facts an article cited sound an alarm as surely as does the dead canary in a killer mine.
There was another good read, too; Mina Walther always enlightens. An article on Medigap is important. So is humor. But for those who care deeply about our planet, this issue was a feast. The following day's editorial, "A Warning on Warming," was icing on the cake. It is later than we think, but it is not yet too late if we have the will to act.

Proof is lacking
I'm writing to raise questions about certain points in Mr. Waldo Proffitt's column, "Confronting Global Warming," and his embrace of the Greenpeace view of the world as interpreted by Jeremy Leggett.
The Siting Board's stated reasons for rejecting FPL's request to burn Orimulsion were based on uncertainty about impacts on Tampa Bay, especially of nitrogen emissions, plus unknown dispersal processes and potential impacts on the bay in the event of an accidental spill. The Siting Board stated that such uncertainties (in addition to known increases in truck traffic) were seen as too large for a majority to agree.
Potential global warming is characterized by far greater uncertainty on the part of both scientists and policy makers. Natural climate variability has brought both higher and lower global temperatures before mankind was a potential factor. Projections of future potential warming are made by large computer models so complex that internal uncertainties are too great to be the basis for radical policy action (such as banning any new fossil fuel plants) that would drastically raise energy costs.
Lamentably, Mr. Leggett and Greenpeace (joined by Mr. Proffitt and Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson) are burdened by no such uncertainties. The Greenpeace campaign could result in diminished availability and soaring cost of insurance, since we know from experience this is the most risk-averse of industries.
Potential global warming is a serious issue that would benefit from cooler heads and better knowledge than that displayed in Mr. Proffitt's column.

Keep it civil
My husband and I are appreciative of the forum for public opinion provided by the Herald-Tribune on its Letters to the Editor page. We find the selection of readers' letters to be balanced in regard to political views.
Instead of using this free showcase for dissenting opinions, some choose the deplorable option of sending hate mail to writers' residences. This has occurred more than once in our case, following the publication of letters written from a conservative point of view. In each case the letter was filled with disgusting obscenities and was, of course, unsigned - hallmarks of the intellectually bankrupt and the cowardly.

Dole a hero
Maureen Dowd's May 17 column, ridiculing Bob Dole, tells us so much more of the shallowness of the character of this columnist than it tells us about Dole.
What has she ever done for her country that can even touch his experience in World War II and his extensive service in Congress? He loves his country - does she? How much talent does it take to belittle a war hero?

FEAR OF STORMS DRIVES INSURERS AWAY FROM SHORE: BLAME IT ON HURRICANE ANDREW. SAYS ONE LOCAL AGENT: ``NO ONE WANTS TO WRITE POLICIES.''

Full text:   For centuries, human beings have been drawn to the power and the beauty of the ocean, but the end of the millennium has produced a notable exception: the insurer.
During the last three years, fearing catastrophic losses from hurricanes, insurers have become more reluctant to write homeowner policies along the East Coast, including the Jersey Shore.
``It gets worse every day,'' said Bill McMahon, whose insurance agency has offices in Ocean City, Avalon and Sea Isle City. ``No one wants to write policies.''
The industry contends that it is fighting for its life, that a period of unprecedented coastal building and an increased potential for hurricane damage have exposed insurance companies to increasing losses.
In coastal states such as Florida, North Carolina, New York and New Jersey, state programs that were set up to be insurers of last resort are swelling with coastal property owners shunned by traditional insurers. Because the coverage is less extensive, homeowners have to buy additional ``wraparound'' policies to cover items such as theft and burst pipes.
That drives up the cost. McMahon said homeowners end up paying several hundred dollars more in annual premiums. Another agent, Bruce Koch, who has an agency in Ocean City, said annual premiums now typically equal 1 percent of a home's market value. And that doesn't include flood insurance, which must be purchased separately.
``The cost is not extreme, but it's higher,'' said Gene Laffey, the president of the Cape May County Board of Realtors.
And insurance agents and others say that many companies have stopped writing new policies east of the Garden State Parkway.
The eschewing of coastal real estate by insurers is commonly called ``shorelining.''
``You have people living in places that weren't meant for habitation,'' said Steve Goldstein of the Insurance Information Institute, in New York City. ``Contrary to what people think, we're not a social agency. We're a business.''
The source of the availability problem during the last three years can be summarized in a word: Andrew.
That powerful hurricane redefined the landscape of risk.
In 1987, the industry determined that a worst-case disaster would cost no more than $8 billion, according to Sean Mooney, an economist with the institute.
Two years later, Hurricane Hugo, which devastated the Carolinas from Charleston to Charlotte, cost $4.2 billion in claims. It was the first time that a hurricane had generated $1 billion in insurance losses.
Andrew, which hit South Florida in August 1992, ended up costing the industry $15.5 billion. The worst-case estimate has climbed since to $50 billion.
Since Andrew, more and more coastal property owners have had to scramble for coverage, according to industry and state officials.
In Florida, the state itself has become one of the biggest insurers. A total of 1.1 million property owners get insurance through state programs that were supposed to be insurers of last resort, Insurance Department spokeswoman Shelly Palm said.
In North Carolina, an estimated 40 percent of all coastal residents are in similar programs, Insurance Department official Bernard Cox said.
And Cox said companies' decisions to pull out had nothing to do with rates. ``It's not the pricing,'' he said, adding that if the department granted carriers a 50 percent rate increase, ``the companies would not go back in there.''
On Long Island, the number of policies in the state's high-risk pool has more than doubled in Nassau County and jumped 40 percent in Suffolk County since the end of 1991, according to figures from the New York Insurance Department.
Because of its location, New Jersey is less vulnerable to hurricanes than Florida or North Carolina or even Long Island. Hurricanes are erratic, but they generally travel south to north. Thus they may bypass New Jersey and slam into Long Island, which juts into the Atlantic.
Still, New Jersey gets hit by other storms, particularly northeasters, and insurance availability has been a problem. In New Jersey's highest-risk coastal zip code areas, about 12 percent of all properties are insured under the state's high-risk FAIR (Fair Access to Insurance Requirements) Plan, the Insurance Department said.
The plan operates as an insurance company, and, historically, it has paid out more than it collects in premiums, according to the New Jersey Insurance News Service. A special fund makes up the shortfalls, but Insurance Commissioner Elizabeth Randall has proposed assessing insurers directly for the shortfalls.
Statewide, the FAIR Plan market share increased about 15 percent between 1993 and 1994, according to the news service's data.
Laffey, the Realtor, believes that the state's estimates are low.
State Rep. John C. Gibson, a Republican from Sea Isle City, said, ``There's at least 40 percent more policies in the FAIR Plan than there were a few years ago.''
Laffey said the state doesn't understand the dimensions of the problem.
New Jersey ``has been closing its eyes to it,'' agreed Kenneth Smith, the director of the Coastal Alliance, a real-estate lobbying group. ``It's been a problem for years.''
McMahon said that his FAIR Plan-related business had increased about tenfold in the last five years.
Concerned about the increasing availability problem, the New Jersey Legislature in December 1993 imposed a nine-month moratorium on all policy cancellations and nonrenewals along the coast. It also commissioned a study to determine whether insurers were changing their underwriting habits.
It found that some carriers did not even have written underwriting guidelines.
The study also found that insurers covering about half of all coastal properties had taken or were planning to take action to cut their coastal exposure.
Three months ago, Randall announced a program aimed at inducing insurers to reenter coastal markets voluntarily. Among other things, it allows insurers to set higher deductibles.
If insurers don't cooperate, she said recently, ``the department is prepared to move forward with a regulatory approach.''
``That's a good way to start,'' Gibson said, ``as long as we don't get too patient with the industry.''
McMahon said that since Randall announced her program, only one company, Franklin Mutual Insurance Co., of Branchville, N.J., had shown interest in participating. He said the seven other companies he had worked with had shown no interest.
McMahon said the increasing expense of reinsurance is a big reason for insurers' reluctance to write at the Shore. Reinsurance is purchased by insurers to cover some of their potential losses, thus reducing their own risks.
``The companies would love the business, but they can't get the reinsurance for it,'' said John Tiene of the Insurance News Service.
Frank Nutter, the president of the Reinsurance Association of America, suggested that until recently, the insurance industry had its head in the clouds when it came to assessing its risks.
``Its assumptions about the potential losses were really wrong and understated,'' Nutter said.
Before Andrew, the East Coast had experienced a generation-long lull in devastating hurricanes. That period coincided with a building boom. The total property value along the New Jersey coast tripled, to $153 billion, from 1980 to 1992, according to Tiene. The insurance institute estimates that $2 trillion worth of real estate occupies coastal counties along the Gulf and the Atlantic.
The hurricane lull may be over. The 1995 tropical-storm seasons were the second busiest on record, with 19 named storms.
Nutter said the industry is greatly concerned about overarching questions of climate change and how it might affect storm activity.
William Gray, one of the nation's most respected long-range hurricane forecasters, discounts global warming's effects on hurricanes, arguing that enhanced warming couldn't explain both the lull and the uptick in hurricane activity.
Gray, who works out of Colorado State University, uses global wind patterns and rainfall conditions in western Africa to develop his forecasts. And global warming aside, he believes the Atlantic and the Caribbean have entered an active hurricane period.
``Apart from the greenhouse effect, it appears we're getting more storms,'' said Mooney of the insurance institute.
Although Gray doesn't predict where hurricanes will make landfall, he holds that with increased numbers of hurricanes, damage is inevitable.
Nevertheless, argued Ed Buscemi, a Long Island councilman whose own insurance was canceled, that doesn't give insurers the right to shoreline.
``To delete a certain class because they live in a certain place,'' he said, ``that's atrocious.''

Full text: THE Government yesterday called on the insurance industry to act as a police force in the fight against industrial pollution.
Environment Secretary John Gummer said market forces, expressed through insurance company pressure on policyholders, could be a more effective force than regulation.
He called on industry to take account of environmental costs and urged insurers to press customers to use technology to avoid creating risks.
Opening an international conference in London on insurance and the environment, Mr Gummer said: "The trouble with nineteenth-century businesses is that they took their profit, leaving the costs to future generations. We mustn't let business get away with not costing goods properly."
He told 100 chief executives of insurers from 15 countries that it was essential to develop ways of assessing liability, or insurers would have to become more risk-averse, which would be damaging for industry.
The conference, sponsored by the UN Environment Programme, follows last year's commitment by the insurance industry in a statement of principle agreed by 50 of the world's leading companies, including the UK's General Accident. Today NatWest Bank's insurance subsidiary will sign the statement, which pledges that insurers will work towards sustainable development by encouraging sound environmental management.
The insurance industry has become increasingly worried about risks from climate change resulting from pollution. Between 1987 and 1993 there were 16 environment-related catastrophes which cost more than $1 billion. The majority of the losses were linked to windstorms and insurers are worried that, if destructive weather patterns continue, their costs will spiral.
The conference called for better environmental reporting by companies so that portfolio managers could incorporate green criteria in their investment decisions.

Abstract: Perhaps Bill Nelson's experience as a congressional astronaut lends unique perspective to his role as Florida's insurance commissioner. Whatever its genesis, a recent proposal by Nelson - to form a regional or federal disaster relief fund before global warming's predicted impacts submerge low-lying coastlines in Florida and other Southeastern states - makes abundant sense. It also is a gutsy call for an elected Cabinet member to predict worse times for beleagured insurance customers (i.e. voters) due to a climatic phenomenon that not everyone agrees exists. As a congressman from Florida's Space Coast and chairman of the House Space Science and Applications Subcommittee, Nelson in 1986 flew aboard a Columbia shuttle flight as a civilian payload specialist 10 days before the Challenger explosion. While he seldom mentions the experience, when he does he invariably recounts how fragile the globe appears from the heavens. The ravages of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 in south Dade County reminded owners of waterfront property and flood-prone homes that they occupy particularly fragile geography. The $16 billion in total losses ($7.3 billion insured loss) that Andrew caused distinguished it as the nation's costliest natural disaster. The magnitude of the losses, both personal and monetary, horrified not only insurers but also the insured.

Whatever its genesis, a recent proposal by Nelson - to form a regional or federal disaster relief fund before global warming's predicted impacts submerge low-lying coastlines in Florida and other Southeastern states - makes abundant sense. It also is a gutsy call for an elected Cabinet member to predict worse times for beleagured insurance customers (i.e. voters) due to a climatic phenomenon that not everyone agrees exists. As a congressman from Florida's Space Coast and chairman of the House Space Science and Applications Subcommittee, Nelson in 1986 flew aboard a Columbia shuttle flight as a civilian payload specialist 10 days before the Challenger explosion. While he seldom mentions the experience, when he does he invariably recounts how fragile the globe appears from the heavens.
Andrew's reminder
The ravages of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 in south Dade County reminded owners of waterfront property and flood-prone homes that they occupy particularly fragile geography. The $16 billion in total losses ($7.3 billion insured loss) that Andrew caused distinguished it as the nation's costliest natural disaster. The magnitude of the losses, both personal and monetary, horrified not only insurers but also the insured.
The state responded by creating the joint underwriting association as a property insurer of last resort, but its premiums were so affordable at first that the flight of a number of private insurance companies from Florida accelerated. Many insurers who remained simply stopped writing homeowner's insurance, a move Nelson fought.
Nelson obviously believes that scientific warnings of global warming's impacts are warranted. At a recent speech to participants in a conference on Longboat Key on "Climate Change and the Financial Sector," Nelson ticked off the expected horrors: relentless heat waves; beaches and river banks immersed by a rising sea level; contaminated drinking water, and hurricanes even more severe than Andrew. Coupled with the increasing urbanization of Florida's coastline, the probability of future damage records is almost certain.
More disasters on the way
Nelson's proposal underscores the need to prepare for when, not if, the Florida shoreline, and indeed every coastline in the nation, confronts another Andrew-scale storm. History provides ample proof that other states are equally vulnerable, including the following examples:
* In October 1995, Hurricane Opal caused $1.86 billion in insured losses as it churned from Pensacola to North Carolina.
* In March 1993, an unnamed "worst storm of the century" caused $1.625 billion in insured property losses on the Eastern Seaboard.
* In September 1989, Hurricane Hugo imposed $4.195 billion in insured losses from Georgia to Virginia.
Nelson and many of his former House colleagues are well aware that, as devastating as many of those disaster records appear, but for chance they could have been far worse. Disaster and insurance specialists have estimated that had Andrew struck the South Florida coast only 40 miles further north, the total damages resulting easily could have surpassed $50 billion, not only plunging many insurers into bankruptcy but pushing South Florida into a prolonged recession, if not depression.
With nearly $1 trillion in insured property exposure along its 1,500-mile coastline and its position at the extreme southern edge of the nation, Florida faces the most potential damage from global warming's effects. As a result, Nelson has had a hard time selling his proposal for either a national or regional disaster fund paid for by the insurance industry.
His call for those funds and for other measures to help remedy global warming and reduce the man-made factors contributing to its potential for harm are only common-sense precautions. His proposals would be expensive, but, as history already has shown, not heeding such warnings has every potential for being far more costly.

Abstract: On April 23 the Florida governor and Cabinet, acting as the Siting Board, by a 4 to 3 vote rejected the application of Florida Power & Light to burn a new and dirty fossil fuel, Orimulsion, in its Manatee County power plant. The reasons for the rejection were laid out in a 26-page "final order." On May 9, ManaSota-88 held a workshop on "Climate Change and the Financial Sector." Planning for the workshop had been under way for months, and the date had been set well before the Siting Board decision was announced. Orimulsion had been the subject of debate in Manatee for at least two years. There had been extensive coverage in the press. Manatee County commissioners had modified air quality rules to assist the fuel change. A hearing examiner had spent many days taking testimony from friends and foes (predominantly friends) of the FPL request.

Full text:   On April 23 the Florida governor and Cabinet, acting as the Siting Board, by a 4 to 3 vote rejected the application of Florida Power & Light to burn a new and dirty fossil fuel, Orimulsion, in its Manatee County power plant. The reasons for the rejection were laid out in a 26-page "final order."
On May 9, ManaSota-88 held a workshop on "Climate Change and the Financial Sector." Planning for the workshop had been under way for months, and the date had been set well before the Siting Board decision was announced.
Yet, it was only at that workshop, more than a fortnight after the decision, that there was any significant, extended public discussion of what I would consider the most compelling reason the Orimulsion proposal should not be allowed to go forward.
Orimulsion had been the subject of debate in Manatee for at least two years. There had been extensive coverage in the press. Manatee County commissioners had modified air quality rules to assist the fuel change. A hearing examiner had spent many days taking testimony from friends and foes (predominantly friends) of the FPL request.
Florida Power & Light brought in experts by the carload, studies by the dozen; sent uncounted lobbyists to Tallahassee to work on bureaucrats, legislators and Cabinet members. State regulatory and environmental agencies pondered and pondered. The governor and Cabinet talked about Orimulsion and Manatee for hours.
ManaSota-88 was the most vocal and persistent opponent of the introduction of Orimulsion. ManaSota-88 and other environmental groups gathered and presented pound upon pound of data on what the change would mean to air and water quality, highway safety and other aspects of life in Manatee and adjacent counties.
My best recollection is that nobody cited climate change as a factor to be considered. Not until the ManaSota-88 workshop of May 9, and even then Orimulsion was not at the center of the discussion. The focus at the workshop was on insurance and banking, highlighted by the remarks of Jeremy Leggett, director of the Greenpeace International Solar Initiative.
Leggett, who holds a doctoral degree in earth sciences from Oxford, spent several years as a consultant to the oil industry. Now, he is the ambassador of Greenpeace to the insurance and banking world. He reported that heads of many of the largest insurance companies in Europe are concerned about the possibility that climate change could bankrupt the industry. If the insurers are worried, so are their bankers.
Leggett says, and a recent story in Business Week also reports, that the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded that worldwide temperatures will rise 1 to 3.5 degrees centigrade by the year 2100, that higher temperatures will lead to more and worse droughts and floods, that sea level will rise a foot and a half by 2100, and that much of this change is the result of human influence, for which read the Greenhouse Effect.
Leggett says the overwhelming majority of earth scientists now believe that the Greenhouse Effect is real and that it is raising global temperatures. A few reputable scientists dissent. Not many, but enough to enable offending industries to say that the case is not proven. To which Leggett replies, and European insurers have concluded, "The absence of certainty is not the same as the absence of risk."
The cause of the potentially catastrophic warming of the Earth is the increase in so-called greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The blanket of gas prevents heat from rising away from the Earth. The burning of fossil fuels - coal, oil, natural gas or Orimulsion - is the chief source of these gases.
Florida, of all the states, has the most to lose from climate change, as Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson pointed out in his remarks at the ManaSota-88 workshop.
How can we stop global warming? The sad truth is there is no way to stop it quickly. The process is under way and will continue for decades, if not centuries. But we can slow it down and perhaps keep it from getting worse by cutting back, way back, on our use of fossil fuels.
The object of both private and public energy strategy in Florida should be to encourage a massive shift to solar energy in this state and throughout the world.
According to Leggett, a high executive of Shell Oil has said that solar energy in the present state of its technology can meet all the energy needs of the world a thousand times over.
We should set out to do it, and Florida should take the lead. The Siting Board should not approve another fossil fuel-fired electric power plant, and the legislature should find appropriate carrots and sticks to persuade energy companies to start the transition to solar power.
How's that for a project to get the next millennium off to a good start?

Abstract: [Alec Paul], who did a study last year of the province's tornado hazard, said Saskatchewan averages only 1.4 strong tornadoes a year. Saskatchewan's worst were the 1912 Regina tornado which killed 30 people and injured 300 and the 1944 Kamsack twister which killed three and injured 44. Overall, Saskatchewan farmers are meeting the tornado hazard by practising erosion-reducing farming techniques, taking out crop and hail insurance and keeping on top of storm forecasts so they can take appropriate cover, he said.

Full text: On June 29, 1963, two men were standing at their farmhouse window watching a storm when the house suddenly blew apart and they were thrown 100 metres into the air.
The tornado, one of Saskatchewan's most severe, took the life of one man and seriously injured the another.
That twister, which occurred in the Spy Hill area near the Manitoba border, cut a swath almost 1.6 kilometres wide and 22 kilometres long, destroying two farmhouses.
It was similar in intensity to the Edmonton tornado a few years ago which killed 22 people, but didn't cause anywhere near the devastation because it happened in a relatively unpopulated rural area.
"The strong ones are infrequent in Saskatchewan but we should be as ready as we can," University of Regina geography professor Alec Paul told a national geography conference on campus Wednesday.
"It is surprising how many (people) are still caught off guard by sudden storms even when severe thunderstorm watches and warnings even tornado watches are in effect."
He noted the province's tornado season runs from late May to the end of August.
Paul, who did a study last year of the province's tornado hazard, said Saskatchewan averages only 1.4 strong tornadoes a year.
Between 1906 and 1991, Saskatchewan had 690 reported tornadoes, of which 118 were classified as strong tornadoes (F2 or greater).
There were 10, including the Spy Hill tornado, that were classified as F3 or F4. (The most intense is F5 which is extremely rare, occurring once or twice a year in the entire U.S.)
Saskatchewan's worst were the 1912 Regina tornado which killed 30 people and injured 300 and the 1944 Kamsack twister which killed three and injured 44.
However, in future there may be a slight increase in tornado activity on the Prairies due to global climate change, he said.
An increase in extreme weather events such as storms and floods is widely predicted to go hand in hand with global warming over the next half century due to the burning of fossil fuels and the buildup of "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Paul says there's so much variation in tornado frequency in this province that it's impossible to see any clear trend to date. He noted some years there are none and some years there are several.
But global warming could effectively mean a northward shift of the climate of the Dakota states, he said. Since North Dakota now gets twice as many tornadoes on average as the Saskatchewan grain belt, the province could get hit with about three per year over the next couple of generations, he said.
Since there's also a higher frequency of flooding downpours in the northern U.S. Great Plains, more farmland flooding and soil erosion could result in Saskatchewan, he said.
However, the frequency of hail storms in the Dakotas doesn't seem to be a great deal worse than in Saskatchewan, he noted.
Overall, Saskatchewan farmers are meeting the tornado hazard by practising erosion-reducing farming techniques, taking out crop and hail insurance and keeping on top of storm forecasts so they can take appropriate cover, he said.

Abstract: Florida is the state most vulnerable to the global warming that scientists believe is taking place, Bill Nelson said. "If the earth continues to warm up, as scientists predict, our state could suffer relentless heat waves, beaches submerged by rising sea levels, contaminated drinking water and more severe and damaging hurricanes," Nelson said in a speech at the Longboat Key Holiday Inn. The state's current problems in keeping property insurance available and affordable started with Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Nelson said, and global warming has the potential to bring more, and stronger, hurricanes.

Full text:   Florida's worst insurance crisis could still be ahead, the state's insurance commissioner warned Thursday.
Florida is the state most vulnerable to the global warming that scientists believe is taking place, Bill Nelson said.
"If the earth continues to warm up, as scientists predict, our state could suffer relentless heat waves, beaches submerged by rising sea levels, contaminated drinking water and more severe and damaging hurricanes," Nelson said in a speech at the Longboat Key Holiday Inn.
He spoke at a conference on "Climate Change & the Financial Sector" hosted by the environmental group Manasota-88.
Florida has nearly $1 trillion in insured residential and commercial properties along its coastline, Nelson said, so "the insurance industry has a huge stake in this."
The state's current problems in keeping property insurance available and affordable started with Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Nelson said, and global warming has the potential to bring more, and stronger, hurricanes.
Nelson said that some of the warmest years on record since 1860 have occurred since 1979, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that worldwide temperatures will rise by 1.8 to 6.3 degrees by 2100.
Nelson said he's proposing these steps for how the problem can be addressed:
* Congress should form a national disaster fund paid for by the insurance industry to help spread the risk of natural disasters across the country, whether from hurricanes, earthquakes or flooding.
Florida already has such a fund, but if a storm were to hit a major urban areas, such as Tampa Bay, Fort Lauderdale or Miami, the losses would be too much for any national insurance company or the state to handle, he said.
* If Congress won't pass such a federal fund, Nelson is lobbying other southeast coastal states to develop a similar regional disaster fund.
But, he said, he's running into resistance since no other southeastern state has as much coastline as Florida and faces as much risk.
* Governments should consider the threat of global warming in making certain decisions, such as the siting of power plants, the development of stronger building codes and assessing coastal development and growth management plans.
* More vigorous exploration of alternative and renewable energy supplies.
* Government, industry and citizens should pursue ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nelson also criticized U.S. insurance companies for not signing a United Nations pledge to consider climate change and other environmental problems in their business practices. More than 50 European and Asian insurers have signed the accord, he said.
Dr. Jeremy Leggett, Greenpeace International's director of solar initiative, also spoke at the conference.
"It was significantly stronger statement than I expected," Leggett said of Nelson's remarks. "This was a prescient and forward-looking message which the insurance industry would do well to listen closely to."
Leggett works with insurance companies and banks around the world on assessing the financial risk of global warming.

There are cruel seas coming Blue-ribbon panel predicts human and financial costs of global warming will be horrendous: [Final Edition]

Abstract: THE COST OF building sea walls to protect vulnerable cities and coastal infrastructure from the rise of sea levels in the next century will be reckoned in the trillions of dollars. Rising sea levels pose a major threat for hundreds of millions of people who live in coastal zones around the world. The IPCC scientists predict a 50-centimetre rise in average sea levels by 2100, between two and five times the rise in the past century, accompanied by an average increase in temperatures between 1.5 and four degrees Celsius. But there remain significant uncertainties. The sea-level rise could be as high as 95 centimetres or as low as 15 centimetres, depending on the fate of Greenland and Antarctica's great ice sheets. And in some parts of the world, sea-level rises could be two or three times greater than the average, because of changes in global ocean circulation, local tide regimes and local heating.

Full text: THE COST OF building sea walls to protect vulnerable cities and coastal infrastructure from the rise of sea levels in the next century will be reckoned in the trillions of dollars.
This is the conclusion of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which conducted a detailed assessment of the effects of climate change for the United Nations.
The analysis, based on advice from the world's best scientific brains, has been assembled in a book - Climate Change 1995 - to be published in April by Cambridge University Press in England. It will be read with enormous interest not only by environmentalists but also by decision-makers in government and in all areas of investment planning, especially in industries such as shipping, insurance, trade, finance, energy, marine construction and agriculture.
Rising sea levels pose a major threat for hundreds of millions of people who live in coastal zones around the world. The IPCC scientists predict a 50-centimetre rise in average sea levels by 2100, between two and five times the rise in the past century, accompanied by an average increase in temperatures between 1.5 and four degrees Celsius.
But there remain significant uncertainties. The sea-level rise could be as high as 95 centimetres or as low as 15 centimetres, depending on the fate of Greenland and Antarctica's great ice sheets. And in some parts of the world, sea-level rises could be two or three times greater than the average, because of changes in global ocean circulation, local tide regimes and local heating.
Climate change may have profound effects on circulation systems that are the dominant influence on local climate - such as El Nino, the Asian monsoon and even ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream, which keeps Western Europe warm in winter.
Time lags in the onset of melting will ensure that sea-level rises should continue for many centuries, whatever happens to future greenhouse gas emissions.
There is also an outside possibility of a rise in sea level of up to six metres, if warming triggered a catastrophic collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is known to be unstable.
Ice melting in the Arctic could have dramatic socio-economic impacts. The IPCC believes that there will be ``substantially less ice in the Arctic Ocean'' by the year 2050. Climate change is expected to free both the North West Passage and the Russian North Sea Route of ice for much of the year.
The entire Arctic Ocean coastline may be opened up for further economic development, including oil prospecting and other industries.
This, comments the IPCC, could threaten large and pristine protected areas in the Arctic and increase the amount of pollution entering that vulnerable environment. Stringent controls on pollution of these newly accessible regions will be necessary, the scientists insist, ``because ice will retard clean-up possibilities for more than 200 days a year.''
The latest studies quoted by the IPCC suggest that a one-metre rise in sea levels would flood 17 per cent of Bangladesh, while 80 per cent of the Majuro atoll, home of the capital of the Marshall Islands, could go. Other island atoll states that would partly or entirely disappear include Tuvalu and Kiribati in the Pacific and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean.
Some atolls may survive rising sea levels if their corals can grow fast enough to compensate, says the IPCC. But they face being struck by more intense tropical storms that would destroy the coral, flood lowlands and contaminate vital groundwater resources with salt. They are ``among the most sensitive environments to long-term climate change and sea-level rise,'' comments the IPCC.
Countries where coastal protection would cost more than 5 per cent of the gross domestic product each year include Anguilla, the Cocos Islands, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Kiribati, the Maldives, the Marshall Islands, Mozambique, the Turks and Caicos Islands and Tuvalu. Protecting the Netherlands alone from a half-metre rise in sea levels has been put at $3.5 trillion (U.S.).
Inland, shrinking glaciers and melting snow will change the seasonal flow of rivers, altering the ecosystem of wetlands and coastal waters and disrupting activities from agriculture to the generation of hydro-electric power.
For example, the amount of water running off from the glaciers of central Asia in the year 2050 could be three times as much as today, causing extensive flooding. But when the glaciers finish melting, the region could gradually change into a more arid, interior desert.
The biggest populations affected would be about 70 million each in China (for instance, the lower valleys of the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers) and Bangladesh, countries that both regularly suffer heavy death tolls from flooding.
``But very large populations'' are also vulnerable in Egypt (especially on the Nile delta), India, Mozambique, Pakistan and Vietnam. Large populations in West Africa are also at risk, with many big cities on low lagoon coasts from Senegal in Gambia to Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Cameroon and Gabon.
Disease may thrive in the changing climate, the IPCC goes on. There could be an extra 50-to-80-million cases of malaria, as 60 per cent of the world's population finds itself living in potential malarial zones.
But ``the gravest effects of climate change'', it fears, may be ``through sudden human migration, as millions are displaced by shoreline erosions, river and coastal flooding and severe drought.

Abstract: THERE is an important question that almost no one is asking: Are world financial markets bad for the environment? The query may at first sound absurd, but consider this logic. To conserve the environment we need "sustainable development." That is: forms of progress that meet needs today without making it impossible for future generations to meet their own needs. Whatever forms of progress we get - sustainable or otherwise - are going to be financed mainly by stock markets, bond markets, and debt markets (banks). These markets rigorously "discount" the future. They place little or no value on clean air and water or a stable climate. They purportedly encourage companies, and investors, to think only of the next quarter's returns, never of the next generation. They have not been very effective at rewarding clean companies nor punishing polluting companies.

Full text: THERE is an important question that almost no one is asking: Are world financial markets bad for the environment?
The query may at first sound absurd, but consider this logic. To conserve the environment we need "sustainable development." That is: forms of progress that meet needs today without making it impossible for future generations to meet their own needs. Whatever forms of progress we get - sustainable or otherwise - are going to be financed mainly by stock markets, bond markets, and debt markets (banks).
These markets rigorously "discount" the future. They place little or no value on clean air and water or a stable climate. They purportedly encourage companies, and investors, to think only of the next quarter's returns, never of the next generation. They have not been very effective at rewarding clean companies nor punishing polluting companies.
So, are financial markets intrinsically opposed to this goal of sustainable development?
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a global group of 120-plus like-minded corporations, recently created a task force to study this question. Our findings are now published in book form.
First the bad news - and this is not a new thought but may be a new insight for many. It almost always makes more financial sense to destroy a sustainable natural resource by overuse or overharvesting, and to put the money in the bank, rather than to use the resource sustainably. This is true of forests, whales, fish, and usually of topsoil.
It is true because, with prevailing interest rates, one can enjoy higher annual returns by harvesting and selling all the trees or fish, and banking the money, than by harvesting sustainably. Interest earned will almost always exceed annual profits from maximum sustainable yields of slow-growing creatures like rain-forest trees. Human laws and institutions must be made to reflect this dire reality.
Now the good news. We found a lot of positive change in the financial community. A growing number of companies are moving beyond regulations and even beyond green consumer pressure to prove to themselves and the markets that "eco-efficiency" pays. Eco-efficiency is the word the WBCSD coined to describe businesses that add ever more value with ever less waste and pollution.
Some investors are making money in the fast-growing environmental sector. A rising minority of analysts and investors realize that eco-efficient companies are generally better managed, and that good management is a vital indicator of corporate success.
Bankers suddenly got interested in the environment in the early 1990s because of a few US court cases that made foreclosing banks financially liable for the ground pollution caused by the foreclosed company. So more and more banks are establishing environmental officers to make sure they don't lend to polluting companies which might themselves incur large fines and thus become bad debtors. A few banks are even selling business customers advice on environmental liabilities.
Many insurance companies - paying out more each year for devastating storms and floods - are becoming as convinced as environmentalists that pollution is changing the climate. They are beginning to attend governmental climate meetings and to lobby for action. They are also creating new business by becoming environmental consultants. The key question is: Will they follow the same logic in their investments as they see in their risk business? If so, their vast investment power would encourage eco-efficiency, and thus slow climate change.
We found that the accounting profession, often accused of being the most conservative among the financial- community players, is in fact among the most creative in coming up with new ways to help companies account for their costs in using environmental resources. The standard accounting practices of the US are steadily gaining in "environmental content," and these practices are being adopted among the world's emerging markets.
Even the rating companies are adding the long-term value of environmental conservation to their rating techniques and are developing new types of environmental rating systems.
Over all, on the question of whether financial markets are "anti-environment," we found cause for concern, but also a lot of changes in the financial community, which is slowly beginning to equate corporate financial excellence with environmental excellence. We think that, without major changes in laws, the markets will begin to reward clean companies more - as profitability is seen to be linked to eco-efficiency, which is a crucial part of Total Quality Management.
And instead of finding gloom and doom, we found a lot of business opportunity in the slow progress toward financial markets that place value on "sustainable" environmental practices.

Abstract: The Earth's thermostat might lie in a species of microscopic ocean plant called phytoplankton, says oceanography professor Bruce Johnson, a university scientist working with the Canadian Joint Global Ocean Flux Study. Samples show more nutrients were available for the phytoplankton just before the Earth started going into the deep freeze. The plants bloomed, robbing the atmosphere of carbon dioxide. This decrease has a chilling effect, says Johnson. In the North Pacific, regions of the Pacific near the equator, and in the southern ocean around Antarctia, plant growth is limited by minute concentrations of iron, a nutrient the phytoplankton need to grow, he said.

Full text: Scientists at Dalhousie University in Halifax believe they may have found a way to combat global warming.
The Earth's thermostat might lie in a species of microscopic ocean plant called phytoplankton, says oceanography professor Bruce Johnson, a university scientist working with the Canadian Joint Global Ocean Flux Study.
Sediment samples taken recently from the Pacific Ocean off Baja, Calif., show the tiny plants may have caused the last ice age, which ended about 12,000 years ago.
"There are some really interesting couplings between the growth of ocean plants and climate," says Johnson.
Samples show more nutrients were available for the phytoplankton just before the Earth started going into the deep freeze. The plants bloomed, robbing the atmosphere of carbon dioxide. This decrease has a chilling effect, says Johnson.
Over the past 150 years, deforestation, the burning of fossil fuels and cement production have caused a drastic increase in carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere in what is commonly known as the greenhouse effect.
But Johnson and other researchers working on the study think the trend is reversible.
In the North Pacific, regions of the Pacific near the equator, and in the southern ocean around Antarctia, plant growth is limited by minute concentrations of iron, a nutrient the phytoplankton need to grow, he said.
When iron is added to water samples from the area, "you get a big bloom of phytoplankton.
"There is a great interest in trying to manipulate the ocean phytoplankton growth to reduce the (carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere. It appears to be one of the less expensive options."
Phytoplankton farms are a possibility in the future, he said.
"This is the ocean equivalent of tree planting. One could presumably do this in large regions of the ocean."
Fertilizing the ocean with iron has been done on a small scale, he said.
Johnson said his group is trying to get funding for further study from insurance companies.
"They have a real interest in climate change, as you might guess, with hurricanes and increasing frequency of storms and droughts."

Full text: GREENPEACE has urged the Government and the financial sector to "get behind the campaign to stop climate change" by investing in renewable sources of energy, such as solar power.
A press conference yesterday marked the publication of a new book, Climate Change and the Financial Sector, a record of the proceedings of the world's first global warming conference for insurers, bankers and other representatives of the financial services sector.
Held in Berlin last April to coincide with the first Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the meeting led to Greenpeace forging new links with major insurance and reinsurance companies throughout the world which tear catastrophic losses from climate change.
Dr Jeremy Leggett, the book's editor, said these companies were "increasingly coming to realise that their industry will be the first losers to changes in climatic conditions". They were also among the first to respond, by joining environmentalists to call for changes in policy.
He spoke at length about the consequences not only for the environment but for the global financial industry, if action was not taken "immediately" to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. He also emphasised that climate change was now a fact, not a theory.
At the Berlin conference, top executives from the worldwide insurance sector became part of the lobbying effort to persuade delegates that its causes - the emissions of carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse gases" from burning fossil fuels - would have to be confronted.
For the first time, "men in grey suits" lined up with environmentalists in taking on lobbyists for the oil industry, the oil producing states and others with a vested interest in fossil fuels. This showed "just how worried" insurers bad become about climate change, said Dr Leggett.
Ms Clare O'Grady Walshe, executive director of Greenpeace Ireland, said she and her colleagues had met a number of senior executives from the Irish financial sector earlier this week and were "very encouraged" by the response they received.
"The Irish financial sector needs to join those abroad who have already begun to lobby for green investment in clean, renewable sources of energy, such as solar power," she said. Greenpeace regards this as crucial if solar energy is to become competitive with fossil fuels.
Ms O'Grady Walshe said Greenpeace was also "encouraged" by the attitude of the Minister for the Environment Mr Howlin, to the suggestions it had put to him at a recent meeting. Yesterday, a Greenpeace delegation met Mr Emmet Stagg, the Minister of State with responsibility for alternative energy.

Abstract: Charles Krauthammer {"Climate of Opinion," op-ed, Jan. 19} takes a legitimate point -- that one massive blizzard on the East Coast of the United States cannot be blamed on global warming -- and then commits the same sin he accuses the media and environmental community of: proselytizing with fiction. Moreover, one of the scientists Dr. Krauthammer quotes, Patrick Mi\chaels, is funded by the Western Fuels Association -- an alliance of oil and coal producing companies. Researchers are now required to disclose funding sources in order to publish in medical journals. Dr. Krauthammer also ignores the recent report of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Released in December, the report concludes that earth's rising temperature is caused at least in part by industrial activity that emits gasses into the atmosphere. One likely result of such warming, it concludes, is an increase in severe weather events. The IPCC is made up of more than 2,500 of the most respected scientists from 55 countries.

Full text: Charles Krauthammer {"Climate of Opinion," op-ed, Jan. 19} takes a legitimate point -- that one massive blizzard on the East Coast of the United States cannot be blamed on global warming -- and then commits the same sin he accuses the media and environmental community of: proselytizing with fiction.
He supports his views by quoting two scientists who scoff at the assertion that climate change may be causing more extreme weather conditions. He fails to mention, however, that the scientists sharing this view are in a minuscule minority.
Moreover, one of the scientists Dr. Krauthammer quotes, Patrick Mi\chaels, is funded by the Western Fuels Association -- an alliance of oil and coal producing companies. Researchers are now required to disclose funding sources in order to publish in medical journals.
Dr. Krauthammer also ignores the recent report of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Released in December, the report concludes that earth's rising temperature is caused at least in part by industrial activity that emits gasses into the atmosphere. One likely result of such warming, it concludes, is an increase in severe weather events. The IPCC is made up of more than 2,500 of the most respected scientists from 55 countries.
Dr. Krauthammer then turns to the subject of nuclear power. But after suggesting that nuclear power might be embraced by those concerned with global warming, he writes that, "of course," nuclear power offends the environmentalists' theology as well.
But from a health perspective, the risks of nuclear power go well beyond leaks and accidents. A "life-cycle" analysis must include the hazards and costs of mining, transport and the yet-unsolved issue of disposal. A similar chain pertains to fossil fuels, the hazards of which include: damage to marine and land environments (e.g., Nigeria's delta region and Ecuador's Amazon headwaters) through extraction, transport and refining, and effects on people's hearts and lungs of local pollution, plus the aggregate -- the global destabilizing impacts of combustion.
American utilities have abandoned the idea of increasing the use of nuclear power because it is extraordinarily expensive and because the public lost faith in the technology. In any event, the nuclear power industry never would have gotten off the ground if Congress had not placed a cap on liability in severe accidents. Without this provision (the Price-Anderson Act), insurance premiums would have been prohibitively expensive.
Fortunately, other solutions are at hand. Technologies for alternative energy and greater energy efficiency in industry, offices, cars and homes are available today. Many businesses have found that energy-efficient technology saves money while improving productivity, and the electric utility industry has begun to embrace solar energy. Even Shell Oil has concluded that solar energy will be fully competitive with fossil-fuel generated power by 2015.
But Dr. Krauthammer's readers should not be misled: The overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activity is related to the changing and more variable climate, that impacts are beginning to be felt and that the costs of delaying action on developing an alternative and energy-efficient future are mounting.

Abstract: Chief among the latter is the effort to debunk the issue by discrediting those who are concerned about it. In U.S. Congress, the natural approach is to impute a political or ideological motive. Global warming, says Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, chairman of the House subcommittee that allocates research funds, is "liberal claptrap" pushed along by "PC scientists." It is "a politicized instead of a scientific concept." Their voices, incalculably amplified by editors and producers seeking "balance," give the impression of a scientific debate that simply no longer exists. One can always find a few qualified contrarians on any scientific frontier. But if you subtract the ideologues and the self-interested on both sides of this issue, the overwhelming body of expert opinion now takes greenhouse warming as a serious challenge to man and nature's long-term well-being, by a ratio of 20, 50 or a 100 to one.

Full text: Note
With the agreement reached by the world's governments a month ago that global warming is under way, climate change has moved from "Is there a problem?" squarely into the "What do we do about it?" phase.
The closer countries come to taking action, the louder one can expect the opposition to become and the more intense efforts to push the issue back into the limbo of scientific uncertainty.
There is nothing about global warming that should make it a partisan issue, though it is sliding toward becoming one. As many corporate and real estate interests are likely to be hurt by doing nothing as by curbing emissions. What's most troubling is that by and large we (legislators, the public, the media and many industries) are ill equipped to separate the serious arguments from the phoneys and red herrings that dominate what passes for a greenhouse debate.
Chief among the latter is the effort to debunk the issue by discrediting those who are concerned about it. In U.S. Congress, the natural approach is to impute a political or ideological motive. Global warming, says Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, chairman of the House subcommittee that allocates research funds, is "liberal claptrap" pushed along by "PC scientists." It is "a politicized instead of a scientific concept."
Mere appeasement
The liberal conspiracy is international. House Majority Whip Tom DeLay explains this year's Nobel prize in chemistry to the discoverers of chlorofluorocarbons' role in ozone depletion as "nothing more than the Nobel appeasement prize" awarded because Sweden is "an extremist environmental country."
A commentator who dislikes environmentalists says global warming provides "environmental fundamentalists" with a "primitive religion" that attributes "everything bad" to the greenhouse effect. "Rarely daunted by fact" and aided by a gullible media, they blame industrialized man's "sins" and promote "hysteria."
A second strategy is the appeal to selected scientific opinion, in this case, to a group of about half a dozen men and women who believe global warming won't happen or will pose no problem. This tiny handful of individuals provides almost all the expert ammunition for the debunkers.
Their voices, incalculably amplified by editors and producers seeking "balance," give the impression of a scientific debate that simply no longer exists. One can always find a few qualified contrarians on any scientific frontier. But if you subtract the ideologues and the self-interested on both sides of this issue, the overwhelming body of expert opinion now takes greenhouse warming as a serious challenge to man and nature's long-term well-being, by a ratio of 20, 50 or a 100 to one.
The third strategy is to choose ignorance. In this group are the don't-confuse-me-with-the-facts crowd in Congress. Others brush the issue aside with uneasy and tired jokes.
Global warming is an international security issue with stupendous economic and ecological stakes. Directly involved are some of the global economy's largest industries: the fossil-fuel business, banking and insurance industries, with trillions of dollars of assets, are potentially at risk. Other industries, such as agriculture, and national economies are also affected.
It is time to move beyond the jokes, sneers, name-calling, know- nothing-ism and false controversies to the real choices. The solid body of scientific evidence obliges us to ask what we're going to do about global warming and how much we are willing to pay.

Abstract: With the agreement reached by the world's governments last month that global warming is under way, climate change has moved from "Is there a problem?" squarely into the "What do we do about it?" phase. The closer countries come to taking action, the louder one can expect the opposition to become and the more intense the efforts to push the issue back over the line into the limbo of scientific uncertainty. Chief among the latter is the effort to debunk the issue by discrediting those who are concerned about it. In Congress, the natural approach is to impute a political or ideological motive. Global warming, says Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., chairman of the House subcommittee that allocates research funds, is "liberal claptrap" pushed along by "PC scientists. Their voices, incalculably amplified by editors and producers seeking "balance," give the impression of a scientific debate that simply no longer exists. One can always find a few qualified contrarians on any scientific frontier. But if you subtract the ideologues and the self-interested on both sides of this issue, you find that the overwhelming body of expert opinion now takes greenhouse warming as a serious challenge to man and nature's long-term well-being, by a ratio of 20, 50 or a 100 to one. That doesn't mean they are right, but such a heavy disproportion has to be reflected by anyone who deals with this issue seriously. There remain myriad complexities, unexplained phenomena and uncertainties to fuel valid scientific debate, but the fundamentals now rest on a solid base of theory and empirical evidence.

Full text: With the agreement reached by the world's governments last month that global warming is under way, climate change has moved from "Is there a problem?" squarely into the "What do we do about it?" phase. The closer countries come to taking action, the louder one can expect the opposition to become and the more intense the efforts to push the issue back over the line into the limbo of scientific uncertainty.
There is nothing about global warming that should make it a partisan issue, though it is sliding toward becoming one.
As many corporate and real estate interests are likely to be hurt by doing nothing as by curbing emissions.
What's most troubling is that by and large we (legislators, the public, the media and many industries) are ill equipped to separate the serious arguments from the phonies and red herrings that dominate what passes for a greenhouse debate.
Chief among the latter is the effort to debunk the issue by discrediting those who are concerned about it. In Congress, the natural approach is to impute a political or ideological motive. Global warming, says Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., chairman of the House subcommittee that allocates research funds, is "liberal claptrap" pushed along by "PC scientists.
The liberal conspiracy is international. House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, explains this year's Nobel prize in chemistry to the discoverers of chlorofluorocarbons' role in ozone depletion as "nothing more than the Nobel appeasement prize" awarded because Sweden is "an extremist environmental country."
A commentator who dislikes environmentalists sees a different motive. Global warming provides "environmental fundamentalists" with a "primitive religion" that attributes "everything bad" to the greenhouse effect. "Rarely daunted by fact" and aided by a gullible media, they blame industrialized man's "sins" and promote "hysteria."The issue is an all-purpose outlet for environmental "scolding."
A second strategy is the appeal to selected scientific opinion, in this case, to a group of about half a dozen men and women who believe that global warming won't happen or will pose no problem. This tiny handful of individuals provides almost all the expert ammunition for the debunkers and testimony for the fossil-fuel industry.
Their voices, incalculably amplified by editors and producers seeking "balance," give the impression of a scientific debate that simply no longer exists. One can always find a few qualified contrarians on any scientific frontier. But if you subtract the ideologues and the self-interested on both sides of this issue, you find that the overwhelming body of expert opinion now takes greenhouse warming as a serious challenge to man and nature's long-term well-being, by a ratio of 20, 50 or a 100 to one. That doesn't mean they are right, but such a heavy disproportion has to be reflected by anyone who deals with this issue seriously. There remain myriad complexities, unexplained phenomena and uncertainties to fuel valid scientific debate, but the fundamentals now rest on a solid base of theory and empirical evidence.
There may still turn out to be some offsetting phenomenon, a negative feedback loop of some kind that removes the risk. But for more than a decade research results have moved consistently in the opposite direction.
The third strategy is to choose ignorance. For those who want to leave the choices to others that's okay. But for those who have a role to play in the debate it is not. In this group are the don't-confuse-me-with-the-facts crowd in Congress. "I'm not going to get involved in peer review mumbo jumbo" says Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., who nevertheless wants to make policy. Others brush the issue aside with uneasy and now somewhat tired jokes or are satisfied with their own instincts.
Global warming is a national - no, an international - security issue with stupendous economic and ecological stakes. Directly involved are some of the global economy's largest industries: the fossil-fuel business, banking and insurance industries, with trillions of dollars of assets, are potentially at risk. Other industries - agriculture, for example - and national economies are scarcely less affected. All parties need to be able to address questions on behalf of the public or private interest they represent for which there are as yet no satisfactory answers.
How does one treat high uncertainty when possible outcomes are irreversible? Should we postpone steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for a few decades until knowledge is greater and technological alternatives to fossil fuels are more advanced? Or will technology not advance without policy signals to guide it?
Are present and likely future trends in energy use moving in the right or the wrong direction? Is gradual change despite high uncertainty preferable to the possibility of having to make an abrupt and drastic change of course at some later date, and if so, at what premium? What economically efficient mechanisms can be devised to ensure that all countries act in concert?
It is time and past to move beyond the jokes, the sneers, the name-calling, the know-nothingism and the false controversies and on to the real choices. The solid body of scientific evidence obliges us to ask what we're going to do about global warming and how much we are willing to pay.

Abstract: WASHINGTON (Reuter) - Warning the Earth is rapidly failing in its ability to support humankind, a research group is urging governments to switch from taxing income to taxing activities that harm the environment. Falling grain reserves, soaring food prices and huge increases in weather-related insurance claims last year all signal severe stress on the planet, the Worldwatch Institute said yesterday in its annual State of the World report. ``We're entering uncharted waters. Expanding human enterprise is colliding with the Earth's limits,'' Worldwatch president Lester Brown said.

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuter) - Warning the Earth is rapidly failing in its ability to support humankind, a research group is urging governments to switch from taxing income to taxing activities that harm the environment.
Falling grain reserves, soaring food prices and huge increases in weather-related insurance claims last year all signal severe stress on the planet, the Worldwatch Institute said yesterday in its annual State of the World report.
``We're entering uncharted waters. Expanding human enterprise is colliding with the Earth's limits,'' Worldwatch president Lester Brown said.
He called on governments to convert their revenue-raising efforts from taxes on income and investment to taxes on environmentally destructive activities, while ending subsidies for mining, fishing and fuel-burning industries.
``The tax code belongs to another age. It makes no sense in the 1990s to have a subsidy on the fishing fleet when fisheries are in decline and fish prices are rising,'' Brown said.
Sweden and Denmark have already started to shift their tax base, with Holland, Spain and Britain following suit, the institute's report says.
In the United States, burning a gallon of gasoline costs the driver only $1.20 (U.S.), but it can cost the country another $3 in medical bills and property damage.
For the first time, the report notes, bankers as well as agri- businesses and insurance companies are beginning to pay serious heed to environmental concerns, particularly in the chemical and real estate sectors.
``Another wave of bad debt could be created by climate change as rising sea levels and more intense, more powerful storms devastate coastal real estate,'' the report says.
Since 1990, the worldwide insurance industry has paid out $48 billion for weather-related losses, compared with $14 billion for the entire 1980s.
Brown said erratic weather such as the blizzards that hit the eastern United States last week or the heatwave that killed hundreds of people in the American Midwest six months ago could be signs of global warming.
Partly because of heat stress on last year's U.S. corn crop, world grain stocks are projected to be a record low of 48 days of world consumption, compared with 55 days after the 1973 grain crisis.
Any serious weather problems next year will cause chaos in with grain markets and food prices, he said.

Abstract: Climatic disasters are causing such expensive damage worldwide that the insurance industry and, increasingly, bankers have plunged into studies of global warming. Their interest injects new economic concerns into a scientific debate over the product of another collection of corporate giants--the petroleum industry. The independent research organization, which has previously warned of growing grain prices stemming from the increased competition for food around the world, said disasters during the first half of the decade have cost the insurance industry more than three times as much as storm damage throughout the 1980s. As a result, institute President Lester R. Brown said Saturday, the insurance industry's concerns place it at odds with the petroleum industry because the burning of fossil fuels is considered a potential cause of climate change, particularly global warming.

Full text: Climatic disasters are causing such expensive damage worldwide that the insurance industry and, increasingly, bankers have plunged into studies of global warming. Their interest injects new economic concerns into a scientific debate over the product of another collection of corporate giants--the petroleum industry.
Those are the findings of an annual study of global environmental and population developments conducted by the Worldwatch Institute.
The independent research organization, which has previously warned of growing grain prices stemming from the increased competition for food around the world, said disasters during the first half of the decade have cost the insurance industry more than three times as much as storm damage throughout the 1980s.
*
As a result, institute President Lester R. Brown said Saturday, the insurance industry's concerns place it at odds with the petroleum industry because the burning of fossil fuels is considered a potential cause of climate change, particularly global warming.
The findings are included in the institute's annual report, State of the World, which was issued Saturday.
Since 1990, the insurance industry worldwide has paid out $48 billion for weather-related losses, "compared with losses of $14 billion for the entire decade of the '80s," wrote Brown and co-author Christopher Flavin, vice president for research at the institute.
The disasters included Hurricane Andrew, which struck the Florida coast in August 1992 and caused an estimated $30 billion in damage, and floods last winter in northern Europe that cost $3.5 billion.
*
Brown acknowledged that greater coastal development and higher real estate costs were responsible for some of the increased damage totals, but these factors do not "begin to match the increasing {risk} the insurance industry is facing."
The insurance industry is so concerned that it is paying for exhaustive research on the human-induced aspect of climate change, Brown said.
The interest shown by that industry and, to a growing extent, bankers concerned about long-range real estate investments, would introduce powerful economic incentives to the debate over global warming.
While the scientific community is not unanimous in its judgment, there is growing support for the theory that if average global temperatures are increasing, fossil fuels and the resulting higher levels of carbon dioxide are playing an important role.
"The entry of the insurance industry into the debate on climate change is a potential watershed," the report said, citing the industry's successful effort to establish stricter fire and auto safety standards in the United States.
"After suffering billions of dollars of losses from more intense storms and other related disasters in the early '90s, some insurance executives are joining the call to slow climate change," the report said.
The institute has been known for bleak forecasts that conservative organizations often challenge as unsupported cries of doom. In addition, its forecasts have differed with the generally more optimistic tone of studies by the World Bank.
Worldwatch focuses research on global environmental issues involving energy, food and population. Half its funding comes from sales of its reports, and half from organizations such as the Ford and Mellon foundations.
The report also draws attention to the growing competition in the world's oceans for a dwindling supply of fish.
The year 1995 saw more conflicts between nations over fishing territory than occurred in the entire 19th century, Brown said. "That's something that's not going to go away," he said.
But similar pressure is growing as a result of limited grain harvests and increasing prices.
"Barring any new technologies that can lead to quantum jumps in food production, like the discovery of fertilizer or the hybridization of corn, the world is facing unprecedented difficulty on the food front," the report said.
It continued:
"The lack of growth of the world grain harvest since 1990 coupled with the continuing growth in world population and the increased likelihood of crop-damaging heat waves in the years ahead at least carries the potential of severe food shortages. . . . Food prices spiraling out of control could trigger not only economic instability but widespread political upheavals."

Full text: THE EDITORIAL PAGE; Today's debate: PROTECTING THE PLANET; OPPOSING VIEW: Rushing into costly environmental `fixes' could have heavy consequences for us all; John Shlaes is executive director of The Global Climate Coalition, Washington, D.C.
At the beginning of what may be a very cold winter, policymakers in Washington and other capitals continue to debate what should be done about so-called "global warming."
Certain proposals suggest controlling everything from vehicle choice to the size of our homes. Some politicize the climate-change debate, using the specter of flooding coastlines and epidemics of disease to frighten the public and to expand government regulation of individual lifestyles.
Headlines designed to frighten the public perpetuate the fear factor: " '95 the hottest year on record." But few probably read that the data are preliminary and the difference is so small (1995 was 0.07 degree warmer than 1990) that it could have resulted from an error in measuring equipment.
While almost everyone agrees that human activity has and will continue to have an impact on our environment, scientists studying that impact say there are many uncertainties. Indeed, that is why the U.S. business community has and will continue to work toward economically and environmentally effective policies, including leading the world in voluntary efforts to reduce emissions.
Members of the Global Climate Coalition do agree these kinds of steps must be taken now if global leaders are going to be able to effectively respond to concerns about climate change. We don't think, however, that an effective approach to potential climate change is going to be higher taxes, lower standards of living and slower economic progress.
The fact is, if all economic activity in the United States were halted today, it would have virtually no impact on future climate change.
Scientists and economists agree that we have time. What should we be doing?
Develop partnerships to move more efficient U.S. energy technologies into developing countries, the source of the vast majority of future emissions.
Strongly support focused research to reduce the remaining scientific uncertainties.
Continually re-evaluate the state of the science and update policies as necessary.
All of these will require sound policies to assure that we have the capital and the capability to develop creative and effective approaches to this global issue. That's the best insurance we can buy.

Abstract: One impact has in fact been landing on your doormat for several years: the steady rise in insurance premiums, which owes much to a string of the most expensive weather disasters in history. Since 1987, 11 weather catastrophes have cost more than a billion dollars each in insurance claims, whereas in the previous 20 years no disaster hit the billion-dollar mark. The worst weather catastrophes were with Cyclone Iniki in 1992, costing $1.4 billion, Hurricane Hugo in 1989 at $5.8 billion, the Mississippi floods in 1993 at $15.6 billion, and the most expensive disaster, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, at $20 billion.

Full text: Greenhouse gases responsible for hike in insurance premiums
London, England
NO matter where you live, there is no escaping the recent changes in global climate. The effects of catastrophic hurricanes and floods across the world are creeping into our everyday lives.
One impact has in fact been landing on your doormat for several years: the steady rise in insurance premiums, which owes much to a string of the most expensive weather disasters in history.
Since 1987, 11 weather catastrophes have cost more than a billion dollars each in insurance claims, whereas in the previous 20 years no disaster hit the billion-dollar mark.
That is partly because more people are living in tropical storm belts and also because there are simply more storms these days.
The worst weather catastrophes were with Cyclone Iniki in 1992, costing $1.4 billion, Hurricane Hugo in 1989 at $5.8 billion, the Mississippi floods in 1993 at $15.6 billion, and the most expensive disaster, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, at $20 billion.
This year is bringing in a record number of hurricanes, including the all-time third most expensive one, Hurricane Opal, which caused $1.8 billion damages in Florida alone.
Call it man-made pollution or a natural swing of climate, but the insurance industry has finally woken up to global climate change.
Last year, the huge German insurance company Munich Re said that climate change was here and would lead to rises in premiums.
That was too late for nine American insurance companies, which collapsed after Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki.
To understand more about why your insurance premiums are going up, it is worth a quick detour around the insurance industry.
Catastrophe insurance works by sharing risks across a sort of extended family of insurers and reinsurers.
Unfortunately, some of the family could not take it any longer when the big bills arrived, and many reinsurers dropped out of the market. That is when the alarm bells sounded.
The amount of catastrophe reinsurance available has shrunk and that, in turn, means insurers cannot spread the risk of a disaster so widely.
But someone has to pay the bills, and that is usually us, of course.
There have been several kneejerk hikes in premiums from the insurance industry after big weather disasters. Take, for instance, the October 1987 storm, which cost $4 billion in northwest Europe, and was followed soon afterwards by an average 10-per-cent rise in household insurance.
The future is not looking too good either. The fear is that global warming is pushing up the numbers of storms by warming sea waters, on which many tropical storms like hurricanes feed for their energy.
Global warming is also bringing coastal flooding due to rises in the sea level. Increasing sea temperatures means the water is expanding, and chunks of the polar icecaps are melting and breaking off.
Many insurers are also beginning to realize that man-made pollution is at least partly behind the global warming.
American Re, the third-largest US reinsurer, is so worried by greenhouse gases that it has started its own investment company to promote renewable energy like solar power, to alleviate the greenhouse effect.

Abstract: John Robinson will make his fourth trip to the Rose Bowl as a head coach with USC on Jan. 1, but he was there first as a player, with Oregon in 1958 when the Ducks lost to Ohio State, 10-7. "I played end and got in for about the last seven seconds," Robinson recalled. "Ohio State had a big All-American lineman {Aurelius Thomas} and when the game ended, he hugged me and said, 'You played a great game.' Bring 'em back: The NBA may regret losing its replacement referees when it comes time to balance its books. In 5 1/2 weeks, the replacements suspended 27 players for a total of 29 games. By contrast, writes Bob Fedas of the Boston Globe, only 21 players were suspended all of last season.

Bring 'em back: The NBA may regret losing its replacement referees when it comes time to balance its books. In 5 1/2 weeks, the replacements suspended 27 players for a total of 29 games. By contrast, writes Bob Fedas of the Boston Globe, only 21 players were suspended all of last season.
That adds up to a lot of revenue from fines.

Wants the Worm: Doc Rivers, the San Antonio Spur veteran point guard, thinks it was a mistake to let go of Dennis Rodman, despite the commotion he wrought with his changing hair color and his off-the-wall comments and behavior.
"All that stuff means nothing," Rivers said. "Dennis is a basketball player. We miss more than just his rebounding. We miss his attitude, his air of toughness. He put fear into people."

Global warming is also bringing coastal flooding, due to rises in the sea level: increasing sea temperatures means the water is expanding, and chunks of the polar icecaps are melting and breaking off.

But leaving aside the arguments about the causes of global warming, the insurance industry is gearing itself up for a more dangerous climate in the future. Watch out for your insurance premiums.

Experts warn fossil fuels must be curbed

Abstract: Slowing down the effects of global warming will depend on getting Western countries to stabilise their use of fossil fuels and limiting the use of such fuels by developing giants such as China, say scientists and pressure groups. Their calls follow the latest report by the United Nation's Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Madrid, which said rises in global temperatures exceed natural variation. In the US a heatwave in Chicago caused a number of deaths, especially among the elderly. Pacific Ocean countries endured a record number of typhoons, while the Atlantic spawned hurricanes well into October - the season usually ends in September. Spain suffered a drought. Storms, cyclones, floods and natural disasters are reckoned to be costing insurance companies 14 times more than they were 30 years ago. Global warming is now reckoned to have increased average temperatures worldwide by 0.5C in the past 100 years. But scientists believe this gradual change is causing abrupt changes in weather systems. "Rising temperatures might mean that events like the hurricane which hit Britain in 1987 will happen more frequently," said David Viner, a senior researcher at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (UEA). "And as sea levels rise, floods that might have happened once every 50 or 100 years will be more likely. Most floods are actually caused by surges rather than gradual rises in the sea level."

Slowing down the effects of global warming will depend on getting Western countries to stabilise their use of fossil fuels and limiting the use of such fuels by developing giants such as China, say scientists and pressure groups. Their calls follow the latest report by the United Nation's Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Madrid, which said rises in global temperatures exceed natural variation.
Evidence that global warming is under way in earnest has been building up in the past year, amidst a number of notable changes in weather patterns. While Britain revelled in one of the longest, hottest and driest summers on record, other parts of the world suffered.
In the US a heatwave in Chicago caused a number of deaths, especially among the elderly. Pacific Ocean countries endured a record number of typhoons, while the Atlantic spawned hurricanes well into October - the season usually ends in September. Spain suffered a drought. Storms, cyclones, floods and natural disasters are reckoned to be costing insurance companies 14 times more than they were 30 years ago.
A number of countries also saw unusual flora and fauna: hammerhead and thresher sharks were caught in the Channel for only the second time this century, while in Britain birds, insects and plants were found further north than usual.
Global warming is now reckoned to have increased average temperatures worldwide by 0.5C in the past 100 years. But scientists believe this gradual change is causing abrupt changes in weather systems. "Rising temperatures might mean that events like the hurricane which hit Britain in 1987 will happen more frequently," said David Viner, a senior researcher at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (UEA). "And as sea levels rise, floods that might have happened once every 50 or 100 years will be more likely. Most floods are actually caused by surges rather than gradual rises in the sea level."
Now that the IPCC has agreed at this week's meeting that global warming is occurring, scientists are trying to predict the rise in sea levels expected as glaciers melt and the seas expand.
"It's very difficult to predict with any accuracy," said Dr Viner, one of the UEA team which investigated the topic in a 1992 report for the pressure group Greenpeace. "For Britain, you might get a rise in mean sea level of 10cm off East Anglia, yet of 20cm off Northern Ireland because there is also the movement of undersea tectonic plates and localised warming of the sea to take into account."
But slowing down global warming will prove hard, scientists agree. Predictions based on the best models available suggest that mean surface temperatures will rise by between 1C and 3.5C by 2100.
"Governments have to take on policies to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and oxides of nitrogen, which are all greenhouse gases," said Dr Viner. However, developing countries such as China and India pose a huge problem for Western governments eager to impose cuts in emissions by reducing the use of coal, gas and oil-fuelled power stations and road vehicles. A Greenpeace spokeswoman said: "These countries are saying 'You benefited from industrialisation over the last 100 years - now it's our turn'."
China is understood to be opening an average of two coal-fired power stations every week as it sprints towards a capitalist economy. "China has massive coal reserves and wants to exploit them," said Dr Viner. "Who will pay for it not to?"
Pressure groups for the nuclear lobby have argued for years that nuclear power does not contribute to global warming. However, environmental groups, as well as some Western governments, oppose the spread of nuclear technology. And as Dr Viner said: "It has its own associated environmental problems."
Western governments aiming to stabilise and then reduce emissions of greenhouse gases may start by putting economic pressure on modes of power generation and transport which are comparatively polluting. For example, aircraft create eight times more pollution than cars, and 22 times more than electric trains, per passenger mile.
Some countries whose economies depend on fossil fuel exports are still fighting a rearguard action against the suggestion that the rise in global temperatures is due to humans. But Geoff Jenkins, head of the climate prediction programme at the UK Meteorological Office, said: "There's no argument that in the past 100 years global temperatures have risen. The argument is now only how much man has influenced that. But all our simulations now point to humans being the cause of warming. There is natural variability as well. It's just a question of the proportion."

Stormy weather: The glorious summer of '95 wasn't so benign: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: Catch-phrases like ``global warming,'' ``climate change'' and ``greenhouse effect'' are familiar to us now, as more and more unusual weather-related phenomena give evidence of an unnatural warming of the atmosphere. Explaining away an unusually warm summer in southern Quebec by referring to global warming is simplistic, but on a global scale, an increasing majority of scientists agree that the atmosphere has changed. The greenhouse effect occurs naturally in our atmosphere and we can be thankful it does. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane and nitrous oxide partially absorb long-wave infrared radiation emitted from the surface of the Earth. They are reflected back to Earth, warming the atmosphere, before they escape into space, resulting in a net warming of the Earth's surface by about 33 degrees C. Without these naturally produced greenhouse gases, the Earth's surface temperature would be a very chilly minus-18C rather than our comfortable 15C. In 1988, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program assembled a panel of more than 300 climate experts and directed them to investigate climate change. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has now grown to more than 1,500 people from 60 different nations.

Full text:   Ed Cowell is a Montreal meteorologist.
With our furnaces clicking on and snow tires on our minds, we can only reminisce about the summer that didn't want to quit. In southern Quebec, we basked in record-breaking warm temperatures and sunshine, but we should be concerned by what was going on in the rest of the world.
The summer of '95 was not nearly as fair elsewhere. Heavy rains and flooding over the southern United States, killer heat waves in the American midwest and near-record numbers of devastating Atlantic hurricanes spoiled our southern neighbors' summer.
Torrential rains caused flooding in parts of Europe and Australia. Unbearable heat waves in Africa and India worsened ongoing droughts and caused outbreaks of deadly diseases. Unusually hot, dry weather caused millions of dollars of damage in forest fires in the West.
Catch-phrases like ``global warming,'' ``climate change'' and ``greenhouse effect'' are familiar to us now, as more and more unusual weather-related phenomena give evidence of an unnatural warming of the atmosphere. Explaining away an unusually warm summer in southern Quebec by referring to global warming is simplistic, but on a global scale, an increasing majority of scientists agree that the atmosphere has changed.
The greenhouse effect occurs naturally in our atmosphere and we can be thankful it does. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane and nitrous oxide partially absorb long-wave infrared radiation emitted from the surface of the Earth. They are reflected back to Earth, warming the atmosphere, before they escape into space, resulting in a net warming of the Earth's surface by about 33 degrees C. Without these naturally produced greenhouse gases, the Earth's surface temperature would be a very chilly minus-18C rather than our comfortable 15C.
However, when extra large quantities of man-made gases, mainly carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are pumped into the atmosphere through the burning of huge amounts of fossil fuels, deforestation and intensive farming, increased concentrations of these gases further warm the atmosphere.
Carbon-dioxide concentrations have increased by almost 30 per cent since pre-industrial times, causing the Earth's temperature to have risen an estimated 0.5 to 0.6 C in the last century.
In 1988, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program assembled a panel of more than 300 climate experts and directed them to investigate climate change. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has now grown to more than 1,500 people from 60 different nations. Using sophisticated computer models of the Earth's atmosphere, these scientists concluded that a doubling of carbon dioxide during the next century would lead to a global warming of 1.5 to 4.5C. This would have serious consequences for
the world's economic, social and natural systems. They recommended reducing carbon-dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2000 if we are to see any slowing of the warming trend.
Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC), which met for the first time in Berlin this spring, found that time-frame to be unrealistic and preferred to push it to 2005 or 2010. Politicians vs. scientists? We know who hold the purse strings. But some good did come from this convention. That was the involvement of different sectors, such as the insurance, tourism, real estate, finance and clean-energy industries as well as municipalities - all of which have an interest in cutting emissions.
Governments have to resolve to implement these reductions in spite of opposing lobbyists and continuing cutbacks.
Why? Consider some of the signs that point squarely at global warming.
- The nine hottest years on record have all occurred since 1980, despite the two- to three-year cooling effect of Mount Pinatubo's eruption in the Philippines.
- A pronounced loss of ice mass and glacier retreat has occurred everywhere.
- In 1994, one of the hottest years for some time, massive fires and water shortages plagued southern Europe.
- Alpine plants have migrated upward in the Alps and trees and small animals are migrating northward in Canada due to warming air.
- Temperatures in Antarctica have increased by 2.5C since 1940, causing disintegration of the ice sheets and the formation of huge icebergs.
- Two devastating floods within 15 months caused billions of dollars in damage and displaced a quarter of a million people in Holland.
Should this warming continue at present rates until the end of the next century, the increased frequency and intensity of storms, hurricanes and typhoons will cause unprecedented floods. Severe droughts will bring starvation and more forest fires. Melting glaciers and polar ice will raise sea levels up to 0.6 metres, permanently flooding heavily populated low-lying areas and creating hundreds of millions of refugees. Entire ecosystems will be wiped out. Potable water supplies will be disrupted and temperatures will favor the growth of disease-spreading insect populations.
Some areas would likely see some benefit from this global warming with more favorable growing conditions and precipitation patterns - but the negative effects far outweigh the positive.
The replacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy sources must be encouraged. Hydroelectricity, solar voltaic power and hot-water systems, wind turbines, fuel cells and bio-fuel plantations are all self-sustaining, clean energy sources with considerable existing technology. Our governments should be urged to replace polluting electrical-supply systems with renewable technologies at a steady rate.
As individuals, we can reduce emissions. We can buy smaller, more efficient cars and support car pooling, ride a bike or walk. We can use public transport and buy ``smart'' appliances and simply turn off the lights.
This is a serious international problem. Eventually, lives will depend on our fixing it.

Abstract: A RADICAL change in campaigning policy on climate change is being adopted by the World Wide Fund for Nature after its campaign director, Adam Markham, acknowledged the organisation had failed its members politically in the last "two or three years". As the climate change talks in Geneva this week struggle to get past the stalemate which has existed since the Berlin Climate Conference of last Spring, Markham said that talking direct to politicians and using reason was not working - at least, not fast enough to get the required action. "We should have a new campaign slogan, No More Mr Nice Guy," said Markham. "Let's go to the front line people who are going to be affected; people who are going to lose the things they value. We have to build political pressure by informing these people. If they get organised into lobbies, groups of hundreds of thousands of voters, then the politicians realise that, unlike us, they cannot ignore these people. They will pay at the ballot box if they do."

Full text: A RADICAL change in campaigning policy on climate change is being adopted by the World Wide Fund for Nature after its campaign director, Adam Markham, acknowledged the organisation had failed its members politically in the last "two or three years".
As the climate change talks in Geneva this week struggle to get past the stalemate which has existed since the Berlin Climate Conference of last Spring, Markham said that talking direct to politicians and using reason was not working - at least, not fast enough to get the required action.
He said that industry, particularly the oil and coal sectors, with their emphasis on uncertainties and the need for more research, had been more successful in getting to politicians at negotiations. As a result, very little was happening. There was no sign of targets and timetables for the necessary cuts in emissions by 2005 and 2010.
"We should have a new campaign slogan, No More Mr Nice Guy," said Markham. "Let's go to the front line people who are going to be affected; people who are going to lose the things they value. We have to build political pressure by informing these people. If they get organised into lobbies, groups of hundreds of thousands of voters, then the politicians realise that, unlike us, they cannot ignore these people. They will pay at the ballot box if they do."
Jeremy Leggatt, science director at Greenpeace, had pioneered this approach by explaining to the insurance industry the implication of climate change for its future. He had told the industry it faced bankruptcy because of the increase in claims that more storms, floods and droughts would bring. After years of effort on his part, the insurance industry was becoming a lobby worrying about global warming.
But that again was an industry lobby. Markham wants to go direct to the people who were affected. His first example was a group in the United States called Trout Unlimited. It has a membership of 600,000 people whose idea of heaven is heading for the hills and spending hours in their waders trying to catch trout and salmon - or, even more special, the native brook trout.
Fishing is big business in several states - Idaho, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and Ohio. But the trout is a sensitive creature which cannot cope with temperature changes in the water. The latest science on global warming shows that the rivers in all six states will become too warm for brook trout. If the species is to survive at all it will have to migrate north to rivers in cooler climes.
TO Adam Markham, this presents a political opportunity. For the 600,000 voters in Trout Unlimited, the loss of the haunt of the brook trout is a tragedy - and this number of people have clout. But add to that the hoteliers, fishing shops and tourist industry for whom the loss of trout will spell economic disaster. This is a lobby at least as strong as the 400,000 US coal miners who are helping to persuade politicians to do nothing about climate change in order to save their jobs.
Another example is the skiing industry. According to the latest, as yet unpublished, effects of climate change, the winter snowlines will move north 5 to 10 degrees latitude by 2050, and the snow season will be shortened by a month. More important from the skiing point of view, the snow line could rise between 100 and 400 metres, depending on precipitation. This is very bad news from some American ski resorts; but, closer to home, it will mean the end for the Cairngorms in Scotland as an expanding ski resort. Much of the Alps will need artificial snow machines if the business is not to founder because the season is badly shortened.
"If these predictions are right," says Markham, "then the whole industry is in deep trouble, yet at Geneva, with the skiing mountains all around, there is not a single representative of the industry present. We need to get these people mobilised. In a few years time it will be too late for them; in 30 years it will be too late for us all. It's time we started playing hard ball, too."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A world-wide scientific assessment of global warming forecasts an increase in diseases, dramatic shifts in forests, and consequences for industries from insurance to tourism.
The report issued yesterday is the first thorough update in five years from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Compared with their first report in 1990, the scientists slightly reduced their projections of how much global temperatures and sea levels might rise as man-made and natural gases in the atmosphere trap heat close to Earth's surface in the so-called greenhouse effect. The new estimate, which will be part of the later report, projects the global mean temperature will rise one to 3.5 degrees Celsius (1.8 to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit) by the year 2100 and that sea levels will rise 15 to 95 centimeters (5.9 to 37.4 inches).
Based on those estimates, the report projected the effect on human health to be mostly adverse. It predicts more deaths from heat waves, though fewer from extreme cold.
The projected rate of climate change would be troubling for forests, as entire forest types could disappear because climate bands will shift faster than tree species historically have migrated.
The report also singled out the property-insurance industry as vulnerable to extreme climate events. It predicts more frequent floods and droughts.
It also predicts less snow cover in the mountains and more frequent coastal flooding that would affect tourism.

Abstract: Vast areas will flood, some people may starve, glaciers will melt and deserts could expand and turn more extreme, according to a report on the effects of global warming over the next 100 years. Scientists from more than 30 nations said in a report issued on Tuesday that global warming, triggered in part by human activity, would cause a 2to 6-degree Farenheit rise in average surface temperature, melt a third of the Earth's glaciers and cause a sea level rise of 6 inches to 3 feet by 2100. The report was prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group II to advise world governments. It involves an analysis of the impact of global warming.

Vast areas will flood, some people may starve, glaciers will melt and deserts could expand and turn more extreme, according to a report on the effects of global warming over the next 100 years.
Scientists from more than 30 nations said in a report issued on Tuesday that global warming, triggered in part by human activity, would cause a 2to 6-degree Farenheit rise in average surface temperature, melt a third of the Earth's glaciers and cause a sea level rise of 6 inches to 3 feet by 2100.
The report said people who live in hot climates, along low coastal areas and on small islands would be the most seriously affected.
"Climate change will affect all countries in one way or another," said Robert Watson of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the lead author of the report.
But he said poor countries already stressed from hot climates, deserts and marginal agricultural production are apt to suffer the most.
The report was prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group II to advise world governments. It involves an analysis of the impact of global warming.
The report's estimates of temperature and sea level rise are based on new studies but are only slightly lower than estimates made last year by another working group of the climate panel.
Global warming is thought to be caused by an increase in the amount of carbon dioxide and some industrial gases spewed into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels, through destruction of forests and by some farming.
Carbon dioxide and other gases warm the planet by trapping heat in the atmosphere, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect.
Global warming could be slowed, said Watson, if the release of greenhouse gases were stabilized. That would require changes in how fossil fuels are used. Use of known technology could reduce the release of carbon dioxide by 30 percent within three decades, he said.
GLOBAL SHIFT
A panel of scientists studying global warming predicts vast changes worldwide over the next century:
-- RAIN FORESTS: Those in the tropics and in the northern latitudes will change. Hotter, drier tropics may cause some rain forests to become grasslands, while cold tundra areas will warm enough to grow forests.
-- FOOD PRODUCTION: Some regions may grow new types of crops, while marginal farmlands in hot areas may become unusable. Famine may occur in tropical countries where food already is short.
-- CLIMATE: Deserts are likely to become hotter and drier.
-- GLACIERS: Up to one-half of the mountain glaciers will disappear, in some cases changing river flows and affecting hydroelectric plants.
-- WATER LEVELS: Rising sea levels will flood some coastal areas, ranging from 1 percent of the land in Egypt to 80 percent of the Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands. About 70 million people each in China and in Bangladesh will be affected by rising water.
-- ECONOMIC IMPACT: Higher temperatures may cause more extreme storms that could cripple insurance companies, already stressed from a series of billion-dollar storms since 1987.
-- DISEASE: As warm temperatures creep north, so will some insects, and with them could come disease. For instance, the worldwide incidence of malaria, carried by mosquitoes, could increase by 50 million to 80 million cases annually.

What We Should Do About `Global Warming'...

Author: By Jo nathan H. Adler

Abstract: The recent release of yet another report claiming that human activity is contributing to global warming has renewed calls for drastic cuts in man-made greenhouse gas emmissions. But even if the findings are true, we may have more to fear from global warming policies than global warming itself. The economic slowdown that would result from the responses commonly advocated by environmentalists and media sources like the New York Times would greatly reduce our ability to adapt to possible changes. The cause of the renewed interest is a draft summary which has been released worldwide via the Internet purporting to document the consensus views of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of scientists created under the auspices of the United Nations to provide governments with an overview of research on global warming and potential policy options. The document concludes that "a pattern of climatic response to human activities is identifiable in the climatological record." In the words of the Environmental Defense Fund's Michael Oppenheimer, scientists have "discovered the smoking gun" linking human activity to global warming. The model supporting the most recent exclamations of a "smoking gun" connecting human activity to climatic changes is the first to adequately represent the impact of nongreenhouse gases emitted by human activity -- gases that could mitigate any warming due to increases in carbon dioxide. The result is the lowest projected temperature change generated by a computer model to date. The IPCC draft predicts a warming of only 0.8 to 3.5 degrees celsius by the year 2100, significantly less warming than predicted in the apocalyptic scenarios with which we are all too familiar. Indeed, the IPCC's lower-bound warming estimate is just over half that predicted just three years ago.

Full text: The recent release of yet another report claiming that human activity is contributing to global warming has renewed calls for drastic cuts in man-made greenhouse gas emmissions. But even if the findings are true, we may have more to fear from global warming policies than global warming itself. The economic slowdown that would result from the responses commonly advocated by environmentalists and media sources like the New York Times would greatly reduce our ability to adapt to possible changes.
The cause of the renewed interest is a draft summary which has been released worldwide via the Internet purporting to document the consensus views of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of scientists created under the auspices of the United Nations to provide governments with an overview of research on global warming and potential policy options. The document concludes that "a pattern of climatic response to human activities is identifiable in the climatological record." In the words of the Environmental Defense Fund's Michael Oppenheimer, scientists have "discovered the smoking gun" linking human activity to global warming.
Although the draft is likely to change before it becomes official, the reality is that human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels, is greatly increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. And it is quite conceivable that this will enhance the greenhouse effect (a natural phenomenon that keeps the earth's climate livable) and raise the earth's average temperature to some degree. How much and how fast is still profoundly uncertain, though the IPCC has a guess, and the summary's release was no doubt intended to encourage policy responses.
The primary basis for global warming forecasts is found in the global circulation models, masterfully complex computer programs that seek to simulate atmospheric changes. As these models have become more accurate at estimating present temperatures, they have also forecast less extreme temperature rises due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases.
The model supporting the most recent exclamations of a "smoking gun" connecting human activity to climatic changes is the first to adequately represent the impact of nongreenhouse gases emitted by human activity -- gases that could mitigate any warming due to increases in carbon dioxide. The result is the lowest projected temperature change generated by a computer model to date. The IPCC draft predicts a warming of only 0.8 to 3.5 degrees celsius by the year 2100, significantly less warming than predicted in the apocalyptic scenarios with which we are all too familiar. Indeed, the IPCC's lower-bound warming estimate is just over half that predicted just three years ago.
But even more important than whether warming will occur is the question of what an increase in global temperatures will mean. Scorching summers, produced by an increase in daytime highs, would have far different effects on human and other life than a wintertime warming that occurs mostly at night. Where the warming is concentrated is also a real concern, as is what effect warming has upon precipitation. Hurricanes are triggered, in part, by increases in ocean temperature. Whether the oceans warm along with the atmosphere, and to what extent, will have a real impact on what an enhanced greenhouse effect would bring with it.
Insofar as these questions have been answered, the indications are that a warmer world would be far more benign than previously imagined. Nighttime warming should increase growing seasons, at the same time that increased levels of carbon dioxide, an essential ingredient in photosynthesis, helps the growth of plants. And an increase in soil moisture levels is more likely than increasingly severe droughts.
Obviously, changing weather patterns could well prove disruptive, as are all unforeseen global changes. But then the human capacity for adaptation must also be considered. From a policy standpoint, acknowledging that there are factors on both sides of the ledger is extremely important.
The real question facing the world's people is not "Is warming real?" but "What, if anything, should be done about it?" Future events will always be indeterminate, and given the magnitude of human activity, this means there will be uncertainty about the effects of civilization. What then is the proper policy response to uncertainty?
Climatologist Stephen Schneider of Stanford University, a prominent advocate of taking dramatic steps to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, suggests that the policy question is akin to placing a high stakes bet. Given the potential for dramatic global changes due to greenhouse warming, Schneider suggests that delaying action is the equivalent of betting one's whole life savings. Even if the odds are in your favor, Schneider suggests, you should not make the bet if you cannot afford to lose. This construction is compelling, as it is surely meant to be. It is also wrong.
The analogy of a bet suggests that there are no costs associated with reducing the risk. Refusing to gamble, in Schneider's view, is accomplished by seeking to stabilize, if not reduce, atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide. This will require dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the industrialized nations, and a limit on increases in the rest. Merely leveling off global greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels, as some have suggested, will not do the trick. Rather, the world will have to face severe limitations on the use of energy, particularly that generated from fossil fuels.
But if the IPCC draft projections are to be taken seriously, a realistic cut in greenhouse gas emmissions isn't much of an insurance policy. Much of the potential warming over the next century is a fait accompli. More importantly, current projections suggest, quite strongly, that there is little cost from delay. Accepting the models, the projected temperature in the middle of the next century will scarcely be affected if policies are enacted now, or if they are enacted several years down the road.
And as the value of a proposed insurance policy diminishes, the cost of the premium increases.
Reducing economic activity by choking off its lifeblood -- energy -- will have real adverse consequences, which we don't need any dubious computer models to predict. The fact is that poverty remains a much greater threat to the world's population than a warmer climate is ever likely to be. Every year millions die from curable diseases, and because of poor nutrition and sanitation.
The arguments for dramatic greenhouse gas reductions are all variants of the precautionary principle -- that it is better to be safe than to be sorry. If only it were that simple. It is true that economic growth and technological advance pose environmental risks. But stagnation is hardly a safer course. In the case of global warming, it is certain that effective emission reduction strategies will impose significant costs. However the costs associated with inaction are speculative, the latest IPCC missive notwithstanding.
Policymakers should pursue the "safest" course. But it would be wrong to assume that this always means increased government action. In some cases the "safer" course is simply to maximize societal resiliency. The proper prescription in this instance is not greater government controls on economic activity, but fewer. Economic growth, market institutions and technological advance are the most automatic forms of insurance that a civilization can have. In the debate over the proper global warming policy, the burden of proof still rests with those who would divert societal resources to guard against an uncertain future.

Abstract: If the IPCC's draft version leaked on to the Internet last month is anything to go by, this United Nations document will show that the scientific consensus is strengthening: pollution is very likely to alter climate over much of the earth's surface in the next century. The scientists are saying that we are probably seeing this already, in the run of exceptionally warm years in the 1980s and 1990s. This year will also turn out to be an unusually hot one, not just in Britain but in terms of average temperatures around the globe. But even the qualified conclusions will be sufficient to spark an explosion of alarming and vivid headlines. It's a funny business, this global warming. Most of the time the media and society ignore the issue. Every now and then we have big stories warning us that sea levels will rise and tropical plagues spread as temperatures rise. Droughts and floods will become more common. Then, not quite as frequently, we get the big debunking pieces which tell us that another group of scientists has disproved global warming and it is all a big scare. In 1896 [Sven] Arrhenuis calculated that if the burning of fossil fuels doubled the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, then temperatures would rise by around 5 degrees Centigrade. In the 99 years since then we have frantically burnt coal, oil and gas, and we can be sure that if we go on at present rates the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide will, midway through the next century, reach double pre-industrial levels. We also now know that we are adding several other kinds of "greenhouse gas" to the atmosphere - methane, CFCs - which are even better than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.

Full text: Scientific consensus about global warming is growing so why are the politicians unable to act?;Every government wants to know which countries will suffer the most damage
At the end of this year an obscure but important body called the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change will publish a fat report on the science of global warming.
If the IPCC's draft version leaked on to the Internet last month is anything to go by, this United Nations document will show that the scientific consensus is strengthening: pollution is very likely to alter climate over much of the earth's surface in the next century. The scientists are saying that we are probably seeing this already, in the run of exceptionally warm years in the 1980s and 1990s. This year will also turn out to be an unusually hot one, not just in Britain but in terms of average temperatures around the globe.
When the final version of the IPCC science report is released the qualifications will be there. One hundred per cent certainty cannot be provided for systems as complex as the earth's atmosphere, oceans, ice-caps and life, which all interact in shaping the planet's response to humanity's massive intervention.
But even the qualified conclusions will be sufficient to spark an explosion of alarming and vivid headlines. It's a funny business, this global warming. Most of the time the media and society ignore the issue. Every now and then we have big stories warning us that sea levels will rise and tropical plagues spread as temperatures rise. Droughts and floods will become more common. Then, not quite as frequently, we get the big debunking pieces which tell us that another group of scientists has disproved global warming and it is all a big scare.
So what are we to conclude from all this? And what measures would it be sensible for modern industrial societies to take in the face of continuing uncertainty about a threat that was first recognised almost 100 years ago, when Sven Arrhenuis, a Swedish chemist, made the first prediction about man-made global warming?
In 1896 Arrhenuis calculated that if the burning of fossil fuels doubled the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, then temperatures would rise by around 5 degrees Centigrade. In the 99 years since then we have frantically burnt coal, oil and gas, and we can be sure that if we go on at present rates the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide will, midway through the next century, reach double pre-industrial levels. We also now know that we are adding several other kinds of "greenhouse gas" to the atmosphere - methane, CFCs - which are even better than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.
But although the hundreds of climate scientists who contribute to the IPCC have made much progress in the past decade in understanding what we are doing to the planetary thermostat, they are still at least five years away from giving a precise estimate of how rapidly average global temperatures will rise.
They are fairly certain that Arrhenuis's alarming 5 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide is a little too high. Their low- to middle-range estimates imply rates of warming and resulting sea level rise that are within the bounds of what advanced industrial societies (but not crowded, poor countries) can easily cope with for the next 50 years - and whoever thinks further ahead than that?
What every government wants to know most of all is how regional climates will change. Which countries will suffer the most damaging changes; which ones might even benefit from benign climate shifts?
The scientists are probably at least 10 years from making good regional predictions. They need computing power much greater than that of the number- crunching supercomputers they now employ for their simulations of the world's changing atmosphere and oceans.
This is high science, involving dozens of research groups which collaborate and debate. It is not the kind of work that throws out an abrupt consensus, when suddenly everyone can agree that pollution has already caused this much climate change and will go on to do that much more in the next x years. It churns out probabilities, not pat answers.
Those with vested interests watch this unfold, then put their own spin on things. The USA's gigantic fossil fuel industry, along with oil exporters like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, play up the uncertainties. Their lobbyists stoop to suggesting that the scientists exaggerate in order to get their research grants.
Some environmentalists, meanwhile, suggest that every extreme weather incident is a manifestation of man-made climate change - forgetting that at any one time extreme and unusual weather is being experienced somewhere in the world. The nuclear power industry also likes global warming because it generates electricity with far less of the "greenhouse gas" pollution of its fossil fuel rivals.
The media simply wants good, strong stories. So climate change is either very serious, or a scare, or off the agenda.
While the scientists plod ahead in trying to ascertain the threat, the sensible response is not to do nothing, relying on adapting to climate change once it happens. It is to take measures that reduce our reliance on fossil fuels without harming the economy.
These so called "no regrets" measures are a moral as well as a rational response to the threat, which is why many politicians advocate them. The problem, as ever, is that they tend to pay lip service to them.
Take one example close to home. At a time when the real cost of household energy is falling (gas and electricity bills are coming down) there is an excellent environmental case for placing higher taxes on fossil fuels. That would encourage people to use less of them and curb pollution.
The revenue raised should first be used to make sure those worst affected (the poor and the elderly) can keep warm in winter, by installing better insulation and more efficient heating systems. The second call on this revenue should be to reduce taxes that keep people out of work, such as income tax and employers' National Insurance contributions.
But what do we get? A botched, enormously controversial introduction of VAT on electricity and gas in which no politician seriously advocated the environmental case. The Government introduced it simply because it needed to raise the money, and Labour is hinting at getting rid of it simply to raise votes. And the bigger picture of a planet in real danger is ignored.

Abstract: NO SOONER had Hurricane Opal blown itself out late last week, ending up as torrential rains over New England, than a new threat was gathering force in what is becoming a record season for fierce Atlantic storms. Tropical storm Pablo, building up in the mid-Atlantic, started to approach hurricane force as Opal's predecessor, Hurricane Noel, was threatening the Azores. Never, since hurricanes and tropical storms were first named after successive letters of the alphabet, have meteorologists in the western hemisphere got as far as P. With two months of the hurricane season to come, this year has already recorded the fourth highest tally since records began in the 1870s. On a month-to-month basis this is the most tempestuous season for more than 60 years. This year's season started earlier than ever when Hurricane Allison hit the Florida coast in June The tally since then reads like a roll call at a meeting of Psychopaths Anonymous. Dean hit Texas in late July, Erin killed 11 people in the Florida Panhandle in early August, Felix killed nine in Bermuda and the mid-Atlantic seaboard some 10 days later, while Iris killed three people in the eastern Caribbean towards the end of that month. Luis hit the Leeward Islands at the beginning of September and Marilyn destroyed 80 per cent of homes on the island of St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands.

Full text: NO SOONER had Hurricane Opal blown itself out late last week, ending up as torrential rains over New England, than a new threat was gathering force in what is becoming a record season for fierce Atlantic storms. Tropical storm Pablo, building up in the mid-Atlantic, started to approach hurricane force as Opal's predecessor, Hurricane Noel, was threatening the Azores.
Never, since hurricanes and tropical storms were first named after successive letters of the alphabet, have meteorologists in the western hemisphere got as far as P. With two months of the hurricane season to come, this year has already recorded the fourth highest tally since records began in the 1870s. On a month-to-month basis this is the most tempestuous season for more than 60 years.
Experts predict that hurricanes will get stronger and more frequent and cause more damage in coming years. Some believe global warming will make things even worse. Insurers fear that climate change will cause them huge losses, bankrupting much of their industry.
Hurricane Opal, the third to slam into Florida this season, was one of the fiercest storms ever to hit the Gulf Coast, with winds approaching 150mph. It killed 17 people in the southern US and at least 10 more in Mexico. More than 100,000 Americans were forced to leave their homes, two million lost electric power and a space shuttle launch was postponed.
The damage in Florida alone - some $1.8bn (pounds 1.1bn) - made this the third most expensive hurricane in American history. When destruction in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina is added, Opal may well overtake 1989's $5.8bn Hurricane Hugo and come second only to the $16.5bn Hurricane Andrew of 1992.
This year's season started earlier than ever when Hurricane Allison hit the Florida coast in June The tally since then reads like a roll call at a meeting of Psychopaths Anonymous. Dean hit Texas in late July, Erin killed 11 people in the Florida Panhandle in early August, Felix killed nine in Bermuda and the mid-Atlantic seaboard some 10 days later, while Iris killed three people in the eastern Caribbean towards the end of that month. Luis hit the Leeward Islands at the beginning of September and Marilyn destroyed 80 per cent of homes on the island of St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands.
Pablo was yesterday 600 miles off the West Indies and moving westwards. It was still too early to predict its final course, but the US National Hurricane Centre in Miami warned: "People should pay attention because anything could happen." Pablo is the 16th named tempest in the Atlantic this year (they are rated as tropical storms when their winds reach 39mph and as hurricanes at 74mph) and the first ever to begin with a letter P. Naming begin in 1951 using the phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc). In 1978 meteorologists began giving them female christian names, hurriedly changing after protests to both sexes a year later. "We did not have phonetical correctness then," says Frank Lepore of the National Hurricane Centre, "but the equality movement was in full flower."
Only once since the naming began have there been more tempests in a season: there were 18 in 1969, but meteorologists omitted to name three of them. But this year is expected to overtake it before the season is out, making it the second stormiest on record, after the 21 recorded in 1933.
It is, however, a quieter year in the Pacific. There have been no named tempests in the central Pacific at all so far this year, compared to the usual four or five. They have reached J for Juliet in the eastern Pacific, which is somewhat below average, and are rather above the average number in the western Pacific and Indian Ocean, where the names have reached S for Sybil.
Professor William Gray, of Colorado State University, who earlier this year predicted a record hurricane season, believes that the storms will now get worse, after 25 years of relative calm. He forecasts that the end of the lull will bring the US "hurricane destruction as never before experienced" because of large-scale development along vulnerable coasts over recent decades.
He dismisses global warming as a cause of this year's storms, but some scientists believe that the weather will get more tempestuous as the oceans heat up: the London Meteorological Office, for example, expects them to increase by 50 per cent as global warming takes hold.
This is causing alarm in the insurance industry, which has already been heavily battered by natural catastrophes in recent years. Twenty-one of the 25 largest insured catastrophes in the US have occurred in the last decade, driving companies out of business, and Munich Re, the world's largest re-insurance group, has warned that climate change is likely to create new records for damage.

Scientists Build Homes That Keep Hurricanes From Raising the Roof: [ALL 09/25/95 Edition]

Full text: A HEADSTRONG hurricane season is spurring renewed efforts to find ways to keep storms from turning homes into heaps of plywood.
In the name of science and better construction techniques, researchers in South Carolina are pummeling roofs and walls with bursts of air in a university wind tunnel.
On the gusty plains of Lubbock, Texas, engineers have fitted an outdoor building with stress gauges to determine the impact of strong winds on an entire structure.
In Idaho, scientists want to set up a test facility that will use the thrusts of eight turboprop engines to help sort out everything from the number of nails to use in fastening walls to what keeps homes on foundations.
All are part of a growing effort to improve knowledge about what many consider a largely overlooked area of science and engineering. While some $100 million a year is now put into earthquake research, for instance, only $2 million to $3 million in federal funds goes into wind research.
Interest is growing, though. Next month, participants are expected to break ground on a construction-industry training facility in Southern Shores, N.C., as part of Project Blue Sky. A $2.1-million collaboration between federal, academic, and private sectors, it will explore stronger materials and sturdier construction techniques.
The training program will draw on the results of wind research conducted by the partners, which include Clemson University, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and private companies. Bob Shea, who oversees hazard mitigation projects for FEMA, calls Blue Sky "unique" in its objectives as well as its collaborative approach.
Several factors are prompting these and other wind-hazard reduction efforts. Not the least is America's love affair with seacoasts. Some 55 million people now live within 75 miles of a coastline, according to FEMA. By the end of the decade, that number is expected to reach about 90 million.
At the same time, people are beginning to realize that when it comes to natural disasters, wind is public enemy No. 1. Between 1985 and 1994, "70 percent of catastrophe-claim payments were paid out as a result of wind-related events," says Dick Griebel, spokesman for the Boston-based Insurance Institute for Property Loss Reduction.
Moreover, as scientific consensus builds on global warming, insurers and emergency planners are trying to anticipate the effects climate change may have on the frequency and intensity of storms. Researchers, too, still face a dearth of basic data on how wind and small-scale structures interact. Much of what is known about wind and buildings is based on wind-tunnel tests for skyscrapers, says Rita Knorr, managing director of technical activities for the American Society of Civil Engineers.
Ben Sill, coordinator for Clemson University's Wind Load Test Facility, adds: "Houses and small buildings have gotten the short end of the stick."
As a result, building codes may not include the most cost-effective requirements for protecting structures against wind damage.
For example, Florida's Dade and Broward Counties, which have the toughest hurricane building codes in the country, require that windows withstand the impact of a two-by-four shot from an air cannon and traveling at 34 m.p.h. Yet Mr. Sill points out that this approach is derived from one used to test the strength of containment buildings for nuclear-power plants. Bits of roofing tile, and even coconuts, might be more realistic projectiles, he adds.
The data gaps fall into three broad areas, engineers say: the loads wind can place on various parts of a building, the ability of different designs to resist those loads, and detailed wind profiles for specific regions or communities.
To get at the first two issues, Clemson researchers use a wind tunnel combined with BRERWULF, a three-sided chamber whose air pressure can be rapidly altered to simulate wind gusts. The chamber allows engineers to test different construction approaches on sections of full-sized walls or roofs, which in effect make up the chamber's fourth "wall."
"Our initial activity was to look at roof-to-rafter connections," says Scott Schiff, associate professor of civil engineering at Clemson. "This spring, we'll be starting tests on wall systems with windows installed."
Yet BRERWULF can only test sections of major components such as walls or roofs. The missing element, nearly everyone agrees, is a wind facility that allows tests on full-scale buildings.
The closest thing to a full-scale test site in the United States is the open-field facility in Lubbock. There, Texas Tech engineers have put a heavily instrumented metal building on a movable platform. "We get some strong winds in the late fall, winter, and early spring," says Doug Smith, an engineering professor engineering.
Yet even that fails to give researchers the range and control they'd like to have over experiments.
To remedy that, Clemson, Texas A&M University, and Notre Dame University have teamed up on the "wall of wind" project, which would establish a full-scale test facility at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. It will use eight engines from "Bear" strategic bombers flown by the former Soviet Union's Air Force, says Tim Reinhold, an assistant professor of civil engineering at Clemson and the coordinator for the project.
The lab also would conduct mechanical stress tests on structures, as well as cost analyses on various construction techniques. Work on the project will begin in December.

Full text:   What do insurance executive watch on TV at night? The Weather Channel.
At least that's what supporters and officials of the US Commerce Department said yesterday as they promoted the department's weather research services, and as they asked insurance executives in Boston to help fend off budget cuts.
According to the agenda, industry executives had been invited to the Boston meeting to tell Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown what kind of weather information they need from his department. But Brown spent nearly as much time encouraging the executives to come to Washington to help him fight budget cuts.
For example proposed cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which provides basic weather data to private industry and runs the National Weather Service, "would be disabling to a number of the functions you're dependent on," Brown told the insurance executives.
Between the Mississippi floods, the western wildfires and hurricanes ravaging the East Coast, insurers have taken billions of dollars in losses in recent years.
Prior to mid-1988, insurers had never lost more than $1 billion on any one incident, said Franklin Nutter of the Reinsurance Association of America. Since then, said Brown, there have been 17 events that cost the industry $1 billion or more, many of them weather-related.
Why not lobby Congress to block the cuts? he asked. "It doesn't mean you're not for belt tightening."
Congress could cut as much as $1 billion, or 25 percent, from the department. Commerce officials said the cuts would eat into the millions of dollars in grants made in Massachusetts.
Last year, officials said, the department provided $11.6 million in economic development grants in the state. Budget cuts could reduce that by 75 percent. NOAA grants in the state could be reduced by $436,000, and repairs to the agency's fleet at Woods Hole might not be completed. There could also be cuts to technology development grants, which provided $56 million to Massachusetts firms and agencies in the past five years, and to other programs.
Insurance officials said they depend on the department's weather data and want even more. They asked for more research on climate change, building codes and on how to predict weather further in advance.

Full text:   What do insurance executives watch on TV at night? The Weather Channel.
At least that's what supporters and officials of the US Commerce Department said yesterday as they promoted the department's weather research services, and as they asked insurance executives in Boston to help fend off budget cuts.
According to the agenda, industry executives had been invited to the Boston meeting to tell Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown what kind of weather information they need from his department. But Brown spent nearly as much time encouraging the executives to come to Washington to help him fight budget cuts.
For example, proposed cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which provides basic weather data to private industry and runs the National Weather Service, "would be disabling to a number of the functions you're dependent on," Brown told the insurance executives.
Between the Mississippi floods, the western wildfires and hurricanes ravaging the East Coast, insurers have taken billions of dollars in losses in recent years.
Prior to mid-1988, insurers had never lost more than $1 billion on any one incident, said Franklin Nutter of the Reinsurance Association of America. Since then, said Brown, there have been 17 events that cost the industry $1 billion or more, many of them weather-related.
Why not lobby Congress to block the cuts? he asked. "It doesn't mean you're not for belt tightening."
Congress could cut as much as $1 billion, or 25 percent, from the department. Commerce officials said the cuts would eat into the millions of dollars in grants made in Massachusetts.
Last year, officials said, the department provided $11.6 million in economic development grants in the state. Budget cuts could reduce that by 75 percent. NOAA grants in the state could be reduced by $436,000, and repairs to the agency's fleet at Woods Hole might not be completed. There could also be cuts to technology development grants, which provided $56 million to Massachusetts firms and agencies in the past five years, and to other programs.
Insurance officials said they depend on the department's weather data and want even more. They asked for more research on climate change, building codes and on how to predict weather further in advance.
Dean Flesner, a State Farm Fire and Casualty Corp. vice president, proposed building a facility to test the effects of wind on full-size buildings, rather than on models. The tests could help determine standards for buildings and building materials, he said.

Abstract: As the summer of 1995 goes on record as one of Europe's driest and hottest, speculation that we are finally witnessing global warming is rife. One would expect this from publicity hungry environmental groups, and perhaps even from the scientists whose research hinges on continued governmental funding. But they are not really pushing the issue at the moment as avidly as another group -- the insurance industry. Richard Keeling, lead underwriter at the Harvey Bowring Lloyds syndicate said at the Intergovernmental Conference on Climate Change held in Berlin this April, "insurers fear that global warming is accelerating the trend towards costlier natural catastrophes." According to another leading insurance researcher, "The speed of global warming is a problem," and is causing "the growing number and intensity of storms." In fact, many insurers say that some coverage may have to be withdrawn from certain locations because of the threat of climate change.

But they are not really pushing the issue at the moment as avidly as another group -- the insurance industry.
Richard Keeling, lead underwriter at the Harvey Bowring Lloyds syndicate said at the Intergovernmental Conference on Climate Change held in Berlin this April, "insurers fear that global warming is accelerating the trend towards costlier natural catastrophes." According to another leading insurance researcher, "The speed of global warming is a problem," and is causing "the growing number and intensity of storms." In fact, many insurers say that some coverage may have to be withdrawn from certain locations because of the threat of climate change.
No, this most calculating of industries hasn't undergone a sudden environmental conversion. More likely, they've decided that concern about climate change might be good for the bottom line.
Some of the world's largest reinsurers, who gathered in Monte Carlo on Monday for their annual meeting, are also worried. They have said that private industry cannot be expected to cover losses caused by natural forces if they regularly affect the same region. The clincher is that some insurers have called for a greater "risk partnership" between policy holders, insurers, reinsurers and governments. In effect the insurers want governments to be lender of last resort in, as Mr. Keeling put it, "Armageddon scenarios."
But is there something more than just one exceptionally warm summer fueling this concern? The warming predictions of some primitive computer models have yet to be borne out by the data. The planet may have warmed by 0.5 celsius since the industrial revolution, but most of this increase occurred before 1940, while most of the greenhouse gases were emitted after that. And satellite temperature measurements, which aren't biased by the urban heat-island effect that plagues land-based measurement systems, have shown no increase in global temperature in recent years. In fact, global temperature historically correlates much better with levels of solar radiation -- which presumably aren't affected by anything human beings do -- than with levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
The insurance business, like all financial services, was a major money-spinner of the 1980s boom, encouraging too many imprudent firms to enter the market. Less care was given to assessment of insurance risk in the scramble for business. Couple this with a string of natural disasters -- winter floods, hurricanes and summer droughts -- and the losses can be significant. Blaming these disasters on climate change, some are undoubtedly hoping that the taxpayers will eventually be asked to pick up the tab.
According to leading reinsurer Munich Re,the insured cost of natural disasters is some 14 times greater now than in the 1960s. But this isn't because climate change is making the world a much more dangerous place. First, the value of property has increased many times. Second, much of the world's most valuable property is located in precarious regions -- no doubt encouraged by existing government forays into the disaster insurance market. Japan and California have high value property and high Earthquake risks. Finally, more property is insured today than ever before as a consequence of greater wealth and the desire to protect that wealth.
Environmental groups have been quick to support business's view of climate change. After all, the refrain goes, if even business believes global warming is happening then it must be true. According to Professor Fritz Boettcher of the European Science and Environment Forum -- a group of scientists skeptical of the apocalyptic pronouncements -- the "scare-them-to-death" approach "has always been a legitimate form of argumentation" for insurers.
Global warming theory is not supported by the data and as a consequence we can't yet know that climate disasters are becoming worse and more frequent. All we can be certain of is that we are spending more time measuring them, and, with modern communications, hearing about them.

Funds Cool, Earth Keeps Warming: [ALL 07/25/95 Edition]

Abstract: Global warming is likely to reemerge soon as a hot political issue. It is, therefore, a bad time for Congress to cut funding for programs that study and respond to the threat posed by global warming - including one essential but largely overlooked program known as "Joint Implementation." The effects of the 1992 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines have largely worn off. Pinatubo's powerful explosion shot huge amounts of particles into the stratosphere, contributing to a temporary global cooling. Scientists say those particles have now settled out, resulting in the reemergence of the global warming "signal." Indeed, the last eight months of 1994 were the warmest on record, and the trend is likely to continue. While global warming's political profile has dropped off markedly in recent years, its scientific profile has not. The international scientific community has been painstakingly refining its understanding of the climate system and is more confident today than ever before that concern about global warming is warranted. For example, a recent consensus report on climate change available from the US Global Change Research Program says it is "very probable" that "global mean surface temperature warming" will increase significantly by the mid-21st century.

For example, a recent consensus report on climate change available from the US Global Change Research Program says it is "very probable" that "global mean surface temperature warming" will increase significantly by the mid-21st century.
A business-friendly approach
Tom Karl, senior scientist at the National Climatic Data Center and among the most pragmatic and respected of climate researchers, recently published a study indicating that since 1980, US weather has become more extreme (note the recent floods in the Midwest), a trend he is now 80 percent certain is attributable to human-induced greenhouse warming.
Insurance companies are among those most concerned. Senior officials from Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance firm, and Lloyd's of London attended the Berlin Climate Summit last March as observers, in part because of their concern about the increasing costs of responding to natural disasters over the past decade. Richard Keeling, former deputy chairman of Lloyd's, observed that since 1987, "every major economy where we have significant exposure has had a loss."
When climate change becomes a political priority again, attention will turn to identifying the most cost-effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the past, strict regulatory responses to environmental problems have tended to be economically counterproductive, inflexible, and highly unpopular within the private sector.
One innovative alternative approach to the global warming problem that is being developed and tested by the US government, in conjunction with the private sector, is a pilot program known as "Joint Implementation." The JI program would enable a more-flexible, market-based approach to achieving mandated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through the creation of an international market for carbon-emissions permits, modeled on the successful US pollution-permit trading program. If a company reduced greenhouse gases in a developing country, it would receive an emissions credit, which could be retained or sold to another firm at market value.
Less greenhouse gas, lower cost
The JI program is essential because it would expand the private sector's options for complying with future US government requirements to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Under JI, a private firm could choose to reduce emissions at its domestic facilities; it could obtain a JI emissions permit by investing in a greenhouse-gas reductions project in a developing country; or it could simply purchase an emissions permit from another firm that had completed a reductions project in a developing country.
This flexibility would enable firms and the US public to achieve the reductions in the most cost-effective manner. For example, a recent study by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) - one of the largest electric generating enterprises in the US - indicated that TVA customers would suffer a 10 percent price increase for electricity if the authority were required to reduce its emissions to 1990 levels by 2000 solely by taking action domestically. With JI, the extra cost would be as low as 1 percent.
No wonder so many private firms are interested in laying the groundwork for JI. They view it as an important hedge against the possibility of an emissions mandate being imposed on their operations because of global warming. By participating in the pilot phase, they can help shape the program so that an option other than rigid regulation is available should the need arise.
Unfortunately, fiscal year 1996 funding for the JI program was recently eliminated in the House, perhaps because it was incorrectly associated with some of the Clinton administration's more activist "climate change" initiatives, and because its small size ($3 million in FY '95, and $9 million requested in FY '96) made it an easy target for budget-cutters on Capitol Hill. Unless the Senate takes steps quickly to restore JI, this precedent-setting program will fall into disarray at precisely the moment global warming returns as a national and international priority. ### 30

Abstract: The environmental movement, in other words, has reached a diagnostic crisis. To use a medical analogy: The world has presented itself, complaining of chest pains. After three decades of examination, there are still those who insist it's indigestion and want to prescribe some Bromo. Others say arteriosclerosis, which means our most basic behaviors must change. Most people -- not just C.E.O.'s -- badly want to find out that our problems are not related to our life styles. Change frightens us: we've come to believe, for instance, that our well-being is lashed to constant economic growth. "It's the economy, stupid." Clearly, it's as immoral as it is impractical for us to demand that underdeveloped countries remain underdeveloped -- those countries passionately want to develop. But it's terrifying to imagine Asians owning cars in the same numbers as we do. The only way out of this dilemma is to rethink what we mean by "development" -- and to do it here first. We've exported our passion for democracy, our devotion to human rights. But that's not all we've exported. More than a billion humans, one in five of us, watch "Baywatch" every week. If the good life whose pictures we flash around the world doesn't change, then all the treaties on earth won't do the job. We need bicycles and we need buses, and we need to make them seem as marvelous as Miatas. Rush Limbaugh has it right when he denounces environmentalists as a threat to current ways of life. The systemic environmentalism he fears has one question to ask: "How much is enough?" How much convenience, how many people, how much money? It's a question that won't go away. It's a question with a time limit, too: either we make these changes soon, or it won't be worth the bother.

Full text: AuthorAffiliation Bill McKibben is the author of "The End of Nature." His latest book, "Hope, Human and Wild," will be published in September.
HERE'S A SHORT CHEMISTRY LESSON. Grasp it and you will grasp the reason the environmental era has barely begun; perhaps you will grasp the history of the next 50 years.
Put a gallon of gasoline in the tank of your car and go out for a drive. Assuming your engine's well tuned, burning that gallon of petroleum should put about half a pound of carbon in the form of carbon monoxide -- CO -- into the air. A generation ago that number was closer to one pound; by decade's end, as new technologies clean the exhaust, it should drop to barely a tenth of a pound. The steady decrease in CO emissions, as well as in those of nitrous oxide and particulates, is the reason the air is clearer and safer now in Los Angeles than it was a generation ago.
On the same drive, however, that gallon of gas will transmute itself into almost five and a half pounds of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide. Long considered proof that gas was burning cleanly, invisible and odorless CO2 is the inevitable byproduct of fossil fuel consumption. It doesn't matter if your car's old or new; there's no filter you can stick on the exhaust to reduce CO2 production. And if the wide international consensus of scientists is correct, this carbon dioxide is now warming the planet more quickly and to higher temperatures than ever in human history.
CO versus CO2 . One damn oxygen atom, and all the difference in the world.
If you focus on carbon monoxide, then you can count yourself among the currently fashionable environmental optimists. Pollution, from their perspective, is an unfortunate byproduct of an essentially sound system. Since smog and its many analogues (river pollution, acid rain, crowded landfills) are precisely the sorts of things that can be tamed with filters and scrubbers, or with small changes in human behavior like recycling, the optimists are in some ways right. Though Congress is even now gutting the laws that have begun to clean America, and though there are plenty of poor and minority communities that never began to get cleaned in the first place, the technology exists to diminish smog, to purify drinking water. It's merely a matter of finding the will to pay for it -- there's no reason for rivers to catch fire. (And every poll suggests that the will is there, that after a quarter-century of hard-fought environmental campaigns the American people are far more convinced than their congressmen that the environment is worth cleaning up.) So if CO turns out to be the real issue, then it's just a systems problem. Environmentalism is a success story, and the world we die in will resemble the one we were born into, albeit with more computers.
That's the conventional wisdom of the moment, best expressed by Gregg Easterbrook in his recent book, "A Moment on the Earth." And yet there are those of us who are not soothed -- who grow more worried with each passing month, and not simply by the fact of a Republican Congress. Those in this second camp tend to be focused on problems like widespread extinction, growing populations, dying fisheries and dwindling wilderness -- signals, like the ever-expanding cloud of CO2 , indicating that our societies and their appetites have simply grown too large. Signals still all but ignored.
Since the environmental movement began, all these crises have been lumped together. The same people who worried about clean air worried about recycling and species extinction, about dirty rivers and the press of population. All these causes are important -- now more than ever as the right attempts to undermine environmental protection -- but acting as if they were all essentially the same crisis carries risks as well as benefits. While it's certainly easier to focus on things like smog, which people see around them every day, the logic of focusing on the most visible pollution cuts both ways. Such a narrowly pragmatic vision is potentially paralyzing precisely because you can clean urban air, you can return fish to the Great Lakes, you can recycle enough to keep landfills from overflowing.
Unfortunately, you can do all these quite vital things without having any real effect on the more systematic troubles. The progress we've made in solving environmental problems is deceptive: we're making no progress at all on the deeper problems, because they do not spring from the same sources. One set stems from a defect in the car; the other set comes from the very existence of the car. And in an odd way, solving the first kind of problem makes the deeper ones ever more intractable -- if visible air pollution starts to decline, then the push for better mass transit dwindles, and with it the chances of cutting the invisible CO2 .
The environmental movement, in other words, has reached a diagnostic crisis. To use a medical analogy: The world has presented itself, complaining of chest pains. After three decades of examination, there are still those who insist it's indigestion and want to prescribe some Bromo. Others say arteriosclerosis, which means our most basic behaviors must change. Most people -- not just C.E.O.'s -- badly want to find out that our problems are not related to our life styles. Change frightens us: we've come to believe, for instance, that our well-being is lashed to constant economic growth. "It's the economy, stupid."
And yet the basic laws of chemistry may soon demand that we give up such fixations. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists assembled by the United Nations, has calculated that an immediate 60 percent reduction in fossil fuel use is necessary to stabilize global climate. This could not happen in a world that closely resembles ours. Addicted to growth, busily spreading our vision of the good life around the globe, we are sprinting in the opposite direction. The growth in our economies and populations wipes out our incremental gains in energy efficiency: from 1983 to 1993, despite a tremendous push toward efficiency by power companies, Americans increased their per capita power usage by more than 22 percent. Electric utilities offered rebates for installing compact fluorescent bulbs, and, indeed, between 1986 and 1991 the typical household added one such light. But as Andrew Rudin pointed out recently in Public Power magazine, the typical household also added more than seven incandescent lamps.
Since the greenhouse effect and other consequences of our civilization's basic momentum have yet to hit us full-on, no mass movement has developed to challenge that momentum. "We are in an unusual predicament as a global civilization," Al Gore said when I interviewed him early in his Vice Presidency. "The maximum that is politically feasible, even the maximum that is politically imaginable right now, still falls short of the minimum that is scientifically and ecologically necessary." And that was before Newt Gingrich.
But this state of affairs may not last. According to the most accurate computer models of global climate, for instance, increased global temperatures may be obvious to the man in the street by decade's end. For all the right-wing bluster about taming the environmental movement, for all the happy-talk books about our ecological triumphs, it will take only a hot summer or two, a string of crop failures or some similar catastrophe to bring these issues center stage once more. A spate of recent studies has begun to make clear that an average temperature increase of only a few degrees hides tremendous heat waves, droughts and storms; the insurance industry has actually begun to worry publicly about the greenhouse effect and the losses it will cause.
If and when such stresses really show themselves, though, we will need an environmental movement that understands what is happening -- that understands that more recycling is not the main answer, that is willing to advocate the unpopular and the disturbing. Partly this means a stepped-up political campaign -- continual pressure on governments around the world to sign and fulfill treaties, share renewable technologies and pass steep new taxes on the use of fossil fuels and other polluters. Already a small segment of the environmental movement has begun to focus on such issues.
But remember the numbers. A 60 percent reduction in fossil fuel use? Even under the most hopeful technological scenarios, it won't happen if we're simultaneously doubling or tripling our economies. More money makes reducing smog easier, because you can afford to build better cars; more money makes dealing with the greenhouse effect harder, because you can afford to buy more cars. So the sweet dream that we'll all grow rich enough to turn green is simply that -- a dream, and one that will turn into a nightmare if we try to follow it.
We face tough choices. The most pragmatic realism, rooted in the molecular structure of CO2 , demands electric cars. It also demands nothing less than heresy: an all-out drive for deep thrift, for self-restraint, for smaller families. Brute objectivity requires new ideas about what constitutes sufficiency: smaller homes, more food grown locally, repair instead of replacement. Environmental visionaries have always talked about simplicity and community, but now atmospheric chemists are starting to say the same things. Not for esthetic and moral reasons, but for eminently practical ones. The world can't support a population of five and a half billion people living like middle-class Americans, much less the eight or nine billion that will soon share the planet with us. That's the crux of the issue -- that and the fact that as long as we go on living the way we do everyone else will want to as well. We need China to stop burning so much fossil fuel -- the developing world now produces as much CO2 as the developed -- but China will pay no attention until we start cutting back too.
Clearly, it's as immoral as it is impractical for us to demand that underdeveloped countries remain underdeveloped -- those countries passionately want to develop. But it's terrifying to imagine Asians owning cars in the same numbers as we do. The only way out of this dilemma is to rethink what we mean by "development" -- and to do it here first. We've exported our passion for democracy, our devotion to human rights. But that's not all we've exported. More than a billion humans, one in five of us, watch "Baywatch" every week. If the good life whose pictures we flash around the world doesn't change, then all the treaties on earth won't do the job. We need bicycles and we need buses, and we need to make them seem as marvelous as Miatas.

THE SLOB WHO LOVES ME A PART OF ME IS SECRETLY PLEASED THAT MY HUSBAND IS CONSIDERABLY LESS TIDY THAN I AM. I GET TO FEEL BOTH PUT-UPON AND SUPERIOR.: [ALL EDITION]

Abstract: MY HUSBAND DOESN'T know about this, but last Tuesday I threw out a very large stack of mail, including a Time magazine whose cover story proclaimed Ronald Reagan's presidential victory, a package of outdated grocery store coupons, a 1992 L.L. Bean catalog, three letters from Ed McMahon and Dick Clark beginning "You may have already won ...," and several invitations to buy life insurance, renew his subscription to Woodshop News, contribute to his college alumni fund and increase his credit card limit. To tell the truth, I'm a neat freak. I don't just give our apartment a going-over before our cleaning woman comes, I wash it down after she leaves, too. If you haven't read the paper by 9 a.m., you're out of luck. When I was young and childless (and thus had a lot of discretionary time), I would categorize the cans in the pantry and alphabetize the spices. It would cause me real psychic pain to see that the chives had somehow crept in front of the chervil. IT WAS NOT ALWAYS THIS WAY. When I was a child, my mother referred to me as "Typhoon Mary" because of the scandalous condition of my bedroom. It was only as an adult that I let neatness into my life, possibly as a reaction to moving from my parents' large house to a cell-like apartment. Or perhaps my apartment simply looked tidy when you measured it against those of the men I was dating.

Full text: MY HUSBAND DOESN'T know about this, but last Tuesday I threw out a very large stack of mail, including a Time magazine whose cover story proclaimed Ronald Reagan's presidential victory, a package of outdated grocery store coupons, a 1992 L.L. Bean catalog, three letters from Ed McMahon and Dick Clark beginning "You may have already won ...," and several invitations to buy life insurance, renew his subscription to Woodshop News, contribute to his college alumni fund and increase his credit card limit.
Yes, I know it's underhanded, but while we're on the subject of credit cards, if Visa and MasterCard have their limits, so do I. Either that mail was going or I was.
To tell the truth, I'm a neat freak. I don't just give our apartment a going-over before our cleaning woman comes, I wash it down after she leaves, too. If you haven't read the paper by 9 a.m., you're out of luck. When I was young and childless (and thus had a lot of discretionary time), I would categorize the cans in the pantry and alphabetize the spices. It would cause me real psychic pain to see that the chives had somehow crept in front of the chervil.
I would defy anyone to maintain an immaculate household with two toddlers without losing her patience or her mind, but I try. Like General Sherman on the march, I pick up toy train tracks as I pass through the living room, T.C. Timber pieces from the front hall and Play-Doh plastic molds from the depths of the potty. A psychiatrist would no doubt say I'm compulsive. I would say I know where everything is in the linen closet.
IT WAS NOT ALWAYS THIS WAY. When I was a child, my mother referred to me as "Typhoon Mary" because of the scandalous condition of my bedroom. It was only as an adult that I let neatness into my life, possibly as a reaction to moving from my parents' large house to a cell-like apartment. Or perhaps my apartment simply looked tidy when you measured it against those of the men I was dating.
Now, about my husband: It's not that Michael is a total slob. Not exactly. Why, he'll redistribute the mound of clusters in the middle of the room just as soon as it begins obstructing his view of the TV. That unruly heap of mail spread on the table by the front door? Be patient; he'll get around to it just as soon as there's a climate change in hell.
The truth is, of course, that everybody is neat or messy in comparison to someone else. And any two people who live together will ultimately come to define one person in the relationship as the fearsomely fastidious Felix Unger of Odd Couple fame, which, by default, leaves the other person in the role of Oscar Madison.
The first maxim of Odd Couple cohabitation, says a psychologist, is that "the sloppy person has to contain the mess to an area that is sufficiently limited either in size or scope to be tolerable to the neat person."
That is essentially the accommodation my husband and I have reached. A portion of our bedroom has been designated the Slob Corner. He is allowed to toss into it whatever muck he wants without my making threatening comments.
The fact is, Michael is perfectly willing to help clean up both his private corner of the bedroom and the public corners of the house. It's just that his sense of order is offended a light year or two later than mine. He'll take care of the dinner dishes, but he may not get around to them until just before he turns in for the night. And since I'm the sort who reacts to stray crumbs like firemen to a fire, the pots and pans will have long since been washed, dried and shelved by the time he locates the scouring powder.
THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT IS secretly pleased that my husband is considerably less tidy than I am. For one thing, I get to feel both put-upon and superior. But on a more practical level, the union between a person who is on a first-name basis with Mr. Clean and a person whose untidiness makes it impossible to walk into his walk-in closet is really the best design for living.
Think about it for a minute. Imagine two people, both messy, joined together in holy matrimony. With all that old food accumulating on the back of the shelves, the refrigerator would resemble a repository for failed lab experiments. The bed would never get made. What with all those clothes piled on top of it, the bed would never get found.
Two neat freaks would be a step worse. My friend Stacy and her husband, Greg, actually engage in competitive cleaning, which not infrequently leads them to arguments about the best method for scrubbing the bathroom.
Perhaps the best one can hope for is that the tidy person in the marriage can put a little starch in the shorts of the slob, and that the messy one can get the neat freak to ease up a bit.
I think maybe Michael and I are getting closer to this jointly habitable ground. Just last night he polished our copper pots without my suggesting it. And just this morning, I left the house without making the bed or, come to think of it, repolishing the pots.

Abstract: Dancing with the one that didn't brung ya . . . Left and right aren't the useful political shorthand they once were. Take the case of Human Resources Minister [Lloyd Axworthy] and Thomas d'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues. The two can hardly be considered soul mates. They were at one another's throats over free trade in the late 1980s and early 1990s and have clashed on a host of other issues over the years.

Saturday, July 01, 1995
IF you want to get officials of the Finance Department riled up, just mention the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. The labour-supported Ottawa think-tank believes deficit cutting is wrong, that the Bank of Canada has ruined the economy through its single-minded pursuit of inflation, etc. etc. "They're left, left, left," says one Finance insider.
So imagine the officials' surprise when the centre received a $133,750 contract from the Human Resources Department for a study on "employment creation and the third sector." As centre president Duncan Cameron recalls, the contract resulted from a discussion he had with Human Resources Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who liked an article on the subject that Mr. Cameron had written in Canadian Forum magazine.
And what is the third sector? Mr. Cameron describes it as non- governmental and non-profit-making, "everything from Friends of the Earth to Oxfam, any group that works on donations and membership fees." Mr. Cameron said that by giving every taxpayer a 100-per-cent tax deduction of $400 annually for donations to the charity of their choice, an additional 250,000 jobs could be generated in the sector. Cost to the government? A cool $4.5-billion. Take that, Finance.
And has the government's generosity to his centre mellowed Mr. Cameron? Not a chance. "I still think monetary policy is insane and there is no reason to cut back on spending," he says.
Rae leaves creepy crawlers . . . When Ontario Conservative Leader Mike Harris moved into the Premier's office this week, his staff found an unusual item left behind by Bob Rae. In the kitchenette was a square black box filled with wriggling worms. It seems that Mr. Rae, ever sensitive to the environment, had an office vermicomposter for disposing of coffee grounds, orange peels and other organic matter. The discovery led to serious, high-level discussions by the new government over the fate of the worms.
In the end, Mr. Harris decided to keep them, both for environmental and practical reasons. Being a keen fisherman, he thought they could come in handy as bait, his spokesman said.
Honey, I shrunk our income . . . Morley Kells, an ambitious Ontario MPP, deemed a spot in cabinet as rightfully his, given that he had left a high-paying job as a lobbyist for real-estate developers to run for the Harris team. What's more, he'd had a short run as environment minister in 1985.
But when Mr. Harris announced his cabinet, Mr. Kells didn't make the list. "I didn't run to be a backbencher," Mr. Kells lamented to a reporter from The Canadian Press.
Perhaps demonstrating why he was passed over, he complained that he would now have a hard time facing his wife. "It's hard to look your wife in the eye and tell her you have a 65-per-cent drop in salary, you've lost the company car, the expense account is gone and you've still got $15,000 in campaign debts," he said.
Taking his leave . . . Prime ministerial confidante David Zussman is returning to the private sector after a short stint inside the Chretien government. Mr. Zussman, a former bureaucrat who served as Jean Chretien's one-man transition team before the 1993 election, is returning to his teaching post in the business school at the University of Ottawa. He has been working as an assistant secretary to the cabinet in the Privy Council Office, first in charge of program review and then in the so-called machinery-of-government section. In addition to teaching, Mr. Zussman plans to write a book with Frank Graves, president of Ekos Research Associates, on rethinking government, and devote more attention to that particular challenge under the auspices of the Public Policy Forum.
Dancing with the one that didn't brung ya . . . Left and right aren't the useful political shorthand they once were. Take the case of Human Resources Minister Lloyd Axworthy and Thomas d'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues. The two can hardly be considered soul mates. They were at one another's throats over free trade in the late 1980s and early 1990s and have clashed on a host of other issues over the years. It would be hard to imagine them agreeing on the pronounciation of tomato.
But Mr. d'Aquino recently wrote a letter to Prime Minister Jean Chretien, copied to every other cabinet minister, in which he heaped praise on Mr. Axworthy's leaked unemployment-insurance proposals. Meanwhile, Mr. Axworthy is fighting off internal attacks on his proposals by an old ideological soul mate, Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin. You say potato . . .
Hot enough for you? . . . Some people only talk about the weather. Some politicians, if they're wily, can find a way to make an issue out of it. Environment Minister Sheila Copps has reportedly told her bureaucrats that she wants to put her stamp on the issue of, yes, climate change.
The request is supposedly rooted in the persistent criticism of Ms. Copps as the invisible Environment Minister, and her rumoured tendency to favour hard-core politics over hard-hitting policy. Though a Liberal leadership race is still years away, the pundits are already saying that Ms. Copps has lost valuable ground on the visibility front to two big potential rivals - Justice Minister Allan Rock and Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin, who have both been able to command lots of media attention for their stewardship of Liberal policy initiatives. Climate change may not be as sexy an issue as a turbot war or a gun-control bill, but the Environment bureaucrats have dutifully complied with the minister's new fondness for the subject. A press release was issued this week with a huge headline: "It's Hot, Hot, Hot."
Court calendar
Both Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Governor-General Romeo LeBlanc will participate in Canada Day celebrations on Parliament Hill today at noon. Tomorrow, the Governor-General will host his annual garden party on the grounds of Rideau Hall from 1 to 3 p.m.. Members of the public are invited. After that, he will attend a concert on the grounds starring Cape Breton fiddler Ashley MacIsaac and Montreal rockers RudeLuck. Next Friday, the Prime Minister begins a weekend of fun at the Calgary Stampede. National Notebook, compiled by members of The Globe's parliamentary bureau in Ottawa and Queen's Park bureau in Toronto, will return in the fall.

Clean money talks SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY People increasingly want more from their investments than cash returns. So why are British pension funds financing an ecologically and socially disastrous dam in Malaysia?

Abstract: IN THE past few weeks Rio Tinto Zinc, and two of the big four banks have had their annual meetings disrupted by shareholder demonstrations or by hostile questioning about the companies' environmental or social policies. Last week, Amey Construction had to defend its roadbuilding before angry investors; Blue Circle is in the frontline tomorrow for burning toxic wastes; also tomorrow, Shell will be castigated for allegedly contaminating Ogoni land in Nigeria and trying to dump redundant oil platforms. Consumer and media concern about the interlinked social and environmental accountability of corporations or financial institutions is rising: Lloyds' cheques are refused by Manchester University student union because of the bank's environmental policies; from Trafalgar House to Hanson, and from the churches to building societies, unethical financial policies are being identified as the soft underbelly of social injustice and environmental destruction. This is confirmed by recent research. Three weeks ago Gallup found the public mood on ethical and environmental issues hardening. Between 60 and 70 per cent of a large sample (30,000 people) questioned for the CWS (the Co-Op) said they wanted responsible, ethical consumerism. Interlinked animal welfare, human rights, social justice, pollution and sustainable use of resources all figured highly in people's concerns. A third said they had boycotted shops or products in the past and 60 per cent said they were now ready to do so. Fifty-seven per cent said they were more concerned about broad ethical and environmental issues than five years ago.

Full text: IN THE past few weeks Rio Tinto Zinc, and two of the big four banks have had their annual meetings disrupted by shareholder demonstrations or by hostile questioning about the companies' environmental or social policies. Last week, Amey Construction had to defend its roadbuilding before angry investors; Blue Circle is in the frontline tomorrow for burning toxic wastes; also tomorrow, Shell will be castigated for allegedly contaminating Ogoni land in Nigeria and trying to dump redundant oil platforms.
Meanwhile, cancer charities are discovered investing in tobacco companies, the RSPCA is found supporting drug companies which test on animals and a heart-research foundation is backing drink companies. Now a raft of blue-chip insurance, pension and City finance houses are exposed for investing pension funds and savers' money in a company building the Bakun Dam in Malaysia (see right), and can expect questions to be asked.
Consumer and media concern about the interlinked social and environmental accountability of corporations or financial institutions is rising: Lloyds' cheques are refused by Manchester University student union because of the bank's environmental policies; from Trafalgar House to Hanson, and from the churches to building societies, unethical financial policies are being identified as the soft underbelly of social injustice and environmental destruction.
The good news for unreconstructed corporations and financiers is that the threat of consumer boycotts and media attention is not new. Many have a history of anti-social investments but the protests of the 1970s were largely seen off without trouble. It can be argued, too, that companies are legally, and logistically, better equipped now to counter public concern, and that they feel less vulnerable because there are fewer private investors than ever.
The bad news for corporations is that the 1990s' targets are much broader, the concern appears to be deeper, the media spotlight is increasingly on them and there is growing evidence of a new public mood. Ethics - from Lord Nolan's investigation down - is on the political and social agenda and the common target is decision-makers who, on behalf of others, commit resources to socially unacceptable undertakings.
The worst news for some boardrooms is that, increasingly, few people seem prepared to accept blandishments, excuses or lax ethical standards; and, correspondingly, more people don't want financial profit to be seen as the only criteria for investing in companies.
This is confirmed by recent research. Three weeks ago Gallup found the public mood on ethical and environmental issues hardening. Between 60 and 70 per cent of a large sample (30,000 people) questioned for the CWS (the Co-Op) said they wanted responsible, ethical consumerism. Interlinked animal welfare, human rights, social justice, pollution and sustainable use of resources all figured highly in people's concerns. A third said they had boycotted shops or products in the past and 60 per cent said they were now ready to do so. Fifty-seven per cent said they were more concerned about broad ethical and environmental issues than five years ago.
The research was broadly supported by last week's Mori's research for NPI, which manages one of Britain's leading environmental and ethical investment trusts; 53 per cent of people holding investments or making financial decisions considered the environment "very important" or "important" in their decision-making, and 57 per cent thought the same of ethical issues. Moreover, 18 per cent said they had not considered investing ethically but "might well do so now" and another 8 per cent said they would like to but their financial advisers had never recommended appropriate funds to them.
1992 Mori research found 73 per cent of adults more inclined to buy products from companies that support the community and society. The mass of evidence, says Roger Stubbs of Mori, shows that the public is keen to hold companies - and the people who run them - accountable for their environmental and social behaviour.
MEANWHILE, the green and ethical investment industry, now with more than 30 funds worth over pounds 900 million in Britain and backed by a conservative 100,000 private investors, has become the fastest growing sector in UK fund management. On the back of good or better returns on portfolios, it is demanding to be taken seriously and pounds 51 billion is estimated to be invested by institutional funds with investment policies that have some reference to non-financial objectives.
This is still just 1 per cent of the UK total and leagues away from the US, where swathes of investments are now concentrated into "responsible" companies. The difference, says Russell Sparkes, director of the UK Social Investment Forum, and author of The Ethical Investor, is partly because US companies are more dominated by private investors. "In the UK about 80 per cent of all shares are owned by big investment institutions {compared to less than 60 per cent in 1981 and about 20 per cent in 1965}. The threat of shareholder activism in the US to persuade individuals to sell their shares is a much more powerful weapon."
Real financial power in Britain is dominated by the few. Analysts believe 10-15 fund managers, working for institutions like the Norwich Union or the Prudential, effectively control UK pension and insurance investments, each managing up to pounds 50 billion. Given the latent public demand for corporate responsibility and the evident lack of it, some financial analysts see it as only a matter of time before banks and pension funds start to conclude that a polluted, risky world of socially-irresponsible business, and environmental liability is not a good long-term financial bet.
THE potential for change, says Tessa Tenant, who manages Britain's leading "green fund" for NPI, may be greatest among those institutions with ethically-inclined constitutions: local authorities (mostly Labour) control up to pounds 60 billion of investments; the 700,000 charities pounds 40 billion; churches another pounds 4 billion. The question, says one city fund manager, is "why aren't these organisations and institutions which have a moral core, all demanding more corporate accountability. Analysis shows that investment in sustainable, long-term business makes financial sense, too."
There are signs of change. The insurance companies are waking up to the future under possible climate change; charities (now turning over more than UK agriculture, albeit with massive governmental input) are converging with business and becoming more "social companies"; the number of firms enquiring about "fair trade" or "social auditing" has never been higher, reports the New Economics Foundation. Terry Thomas, managing director of the Co-Op Bank, says: "Few of Britain's biggest and best businesses would not claim to be part of their communities. It is not a fashion, but a long-term recipe for success."
The City, though, is deeply conservative. Mark Mansley, ex-chief analyst for Chase Manhattan and now of Delphi, says traditional criteria, such as financial strength and quality of management, still rule. Mori found only 6 per cent of UK fund managers and broking analysts taking the environment into account, and only 3 per cent considering social responsibility.
In the end, says Jonathon Porritt, the argument is about sustainability. He finds the City's behaviour mistifying. "Commentators like Will Hutton," he says, "have noted the City's short-termism, its chronic clubbiness, the sense that it is value free. But in his coruscating critique . . . there is practically nothing about socially and environmentally friendly investing."
Yet, he argues, "very exciting things are happening. There's been a diffusion of ownership of the environmental agenda. It's diversifying into a range of societal interests, being taken up by different parts of the business community. The City has played no part in advancing the sustainability debate, but sustainability is not possible unless capital markets reflect the concerns of society. If they continue to invest in the wrong things, the wrong way for the wrong reasons and in the wrong countries, the chance of sustainability is nil."

Abstract: BRITAIN'S leading insurance companies are considering a top-level confidential report that urges them to adopt a new green investment policy to combat global warming. The report, which has been obtained by the Independent on Sunday, is the latest sign of growing alarm that man-made climate change is posing a threat to the viability of the insurance industry, after an unprecedented series of natural catastrophes. Compiled as the result of a visit by a high-level delegation from Lloyd's of London to an international climate conference in Berlin last month, the report says that "global warming is probably taking place already" bringing an "increased likelihood of extreme climatic events". It adds: "It is imperative for insurers to make every effort to mitigate their exposure."

Full text: BRITAIN'S leading insurance companies are considering a top-level confidential report that urges them to adopt a new green investment policy to combat global warming.
The document suggests that the industry should switch some of the $100bn( pounds 63bn)- plus of investment it has worldwide in fossil-fuel industries into generators of alternative energy.
The report, which has been obtained by the Independent on Sunday, is the latest sign of growing alarm that man-made climate change is posing a threat to the viability of the insurance industry, after an unprecedented series of natural catastrophes.
Compiled as the result of a visit by a high-level delegation from Lloyd's of London to an international climate conference in Berlin last month, the report says that "global warming is probably taking place already" bringing an "increased likelihood of extreme climatic events". It adds: "It is imperative for insurers to make every effort to mitigate their exposure."
In the last seven and a half years, 15 natural catastrophes have each cost the world insurance industry more than a billion dollars: no previous "billion dollar cat" had ever occurred.
Giant floods devastated the United States in 1993 and the Netherlands earlier this year. Nine American insurance companies collapsed after two hurricanes - Andrew and Iniki - hit Florida and Hawaii within seven weeks in the autumn of 1992. And by the beginning of the next year, 24 reinsurers had pulled out of the Caribbean after a similar battering by storms.
Yet the industry got off lightly: had Hurricane Andrew - which caused $16.5bn of damage - strayed just 20 miles further north, to take it through downtown Miami, the insurance bill would have been $75bn. If it had maintained strength and hit New Orleans, this would have risen to $100bn - more than half the entire capital and surplus of all the property and casualty insurance companies in the US.
Insurers are now increasingly making common cause with scientists and environmentalists, who are warning of the dangers of global warming. Scientists expect that the weather will get more stormy as the climate heats up, mainly as the result of pollution from carbon dioxide, arising overwhelmingly from the burning of coal, oil and gas. The changing climate would also cause the seas to get warmer and expand, flooding coastal areas.
Last month, a three-man delegation - Richard Keeling, theformer Lloyd's deputy chairman, David Mann, a leading underwriter, and James Anderson from Gibbs Hartley Copper - attended the first meeting of the parties to an international treaty to combat climate change, which was signed at the Earth Summit in Rio three years ago.
The confidential internal report of their visit, written by Mr Anderson, says: "The scientists and all the delegates for the various countries were unanimous in their belief that global warming was occurring and that an increased frequency of extreme climatic events was probable."
The report - which has been sent to the leaders of Lloyd's, the Association of British Insurers and the Institute of London Underwriters - says that the fossil-fuel industries are lobbying against steps to tackle global warming and "are likely to effectively emasculate any measures that might be taken". The report adds: "It is thus probable that the insurance industry is going to have to take some initiatives, either by itself or along with the banking industry."

Abstract: We must make such connections if we are to redefine "national security"; global climate change and other threats require it. Mr. Lake made reference to the "new threats" of environmental degradation and population growth; but in discussing only "old threats" in his speech (that is, military), you miss the point. Failure to broaden our concept of national security lies at the root of isolationism and the heart of today's debate.

You miss a key point of the speech of Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser (news article, April 28) that relates to Mark Hertsgaard's April 8 Op-Ed article on the Berlin climate change conference.

We must make such connections if we are to redefine "national security"; global climate change and other threats require it. Mr. Lake made reference to the "new threats" of environmental degradation and population growth; but in discussing only "old threats" in his speech (that is, military), you miss the point. Failure to broaden our concept of national security lies at the root of isolationism and the heart of today's debate.
Those who wish to reduce our foreign involvement are caught in outmoded ideas of national security and preparedness. The United States can no longer discuss security without paying attention to the environmental and economic impacts of climate change, such as flooding and losses to the insurance industry. And it can no longer discuss preparedness without taking a precautionary approach to address these and other threats.
Just as Harry Truman, facing an unfriendly Congress, accomplished the Berlin airlift en route to a second term, President Clinton should begin shaping United States foreign policy for the 21st century.
Putting climate change and other emerging national security threats on the foreign policy "radar screen" would benefit the United States economically and environmentally.
Redefining our foreign policy will require bipartisanship and take time. New issues like climate change show that the task is to rethink, not reduce, foreign aid. SETH DUNN Washington, April 28, 1995 The writer is with U.S. Climate Action Network.

Full text: Environment ministers from around the world met this month in Berlin to discuss the future of the international Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The ministers agreed that the current commitments in the convention are inadequate to address the climate change threat, but made no new commitments to control the greenhouse gas emissions produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. Instead, they simply launched another two years of negotiations.
More talk, no new actions. The Berlin Climate Summit failed to move the international community beyond the weak commitments agreed to at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Why?
Not because the problem has become less urgent: Climate is changing. In the last few months, we have seen signs that the Antarctic ice shelf is breaking apart, a ``flood of the century'' in Europe for the second straight year, and the continuation of record-setting droughts in the Southern Hemisphere. It still is impossible to definitely link these climatic changes and greenhouse gas emissions from human activity, but scientists expect similar changes will result from human-induced global warming.
No, the Berlin Climate Summit failed because most governments in industrialized countries have not developed credible action plans to meet their existing commitments to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Canada is one of the worst offenders in this regard, having produced an ``inaction'' plan that contains no commitments to implement new actions to control greenhouse gas emissions.
International progress on climate change requires industrialized countries like Canada to begin to take serious steps to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions. If Canada ever is to address the climate change issue successfully, three interrelated obstacles must be overcome:
*A lack of political will.
Canada's climate change policy now is designed on a consensual, lowest-common denominator basis. This means that Canadian policy is determined by the Alberta government under the direction of the fossil fuel industries. Federal and provincial governments must develop the political courage to design and implement greenhouse gas reduction measures that might not win the fossil fuel industries' seal of approval.
Until governments are prepared to put the interests of all Canadians ahead of the interests of the fossil fuel industries, we will never seriously reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
*The myth of economic destruction.
The fossil fuel industries would have us believe that taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will bring economic ruin to Canada. What they really are voicing, however, is a concern about the economic impact on themselves.
Recent government analysis of stronger greenhouse gas reduction measures shows that the economic impact of such action on Canada actually is positive, with little impact on GDP, an increase in jobs and only minor impacts on Alberta. Other studies have shown that the bogeyman of the fossil fuel industries, a carbon tax, would provide significant net benefits to the Canadian economy if implemented in tandem with reductions in payroll and income taxes.
How can this be? Improving energy efficiency, the short-term strategy to fight climate change, will enhance the competitiveness of Canadian industry and save money for industrialists and home-owners alike. It also will create jobs in those industries (construction, engineering, energy service companies) that will design and implement energy efficiency improvements. The longer-term solution to climate change, a shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, would further the development of emerging industries in Canada that have huge strategic and export potential.
Any Canadian climate change strategy certainly will have to recognize and address the economic impact on Alberta's fossil fuel industries of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Federal and provincial governments should not, however, deny all Canadians the significant benefits of these actions simply because they may also have some costs.
*The lack of a united voice for greenhouse gas reductions.
The fossil fuel industries are a strong and organized lobby against serious action to reduce greenhouse gas emission. The many sectors of Canadian society that will benefit from such actions, on the other hand, remain disorganized.
Industries that are threatened by the potential impact of climate change (insurance, agriculture, forestry, fisheries) need to work with those industries that will benefit directly from greenhouse gas reduction measures to provide an alternative lobby on climate change.
The Berlin Climate Summit has kept international efforts to fight climate change alive, but barely.
When environment ministers meet again in 1997, they must revitalize the Framework Convention on Climate Change by agreeing to new commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in industrialized countries.
If Canada is to be a leader in this effort, Canadians must demand that federal and provincial governments take action at home to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - on behalf of all Canadians.

Abstract: About 70 experts from across the country gathered in Charleston to assess how climate change may affect the Southeast. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Oak Ridge (Tenn.) National Laboratory sponsored the workshop, the first in a series of three. Two published papers on the controversial topic have identified a global change in temperature and weather, said Courtney Riordan of the EPA Resource and Development Office that sponsors a global climate research program. Carbon dioxide, released by burning fossil fuels, has risen from 280 to 350 parts per million since the Industrial Revolution, he said. The global temperature might climb 4.5 degrees Celsius if the level hits 500, he said. Thanks to volcanoes, levels may have averaged 600 to 900 when dinosaurs and tropical fern forests dominated the planet.

Full text: The sea is rising. Glaciers are melting and temperatures climbing, according to scientists meeting in Charleston, and that may bring dramatic and diverse changes in the low-lying Lowcountry.
Saltwater could flood houses and freshwater wetlands. Local fish, fishermen and tourism may suffer. Hurricanes could increase and disease-bearing tropical insects may head north, speakers said here Wednesday.
About 70 experts from across the country gathered in Charleston to assess how climate change may affect the Southeast. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Oak Ridge (Tenn.) National Laboratory sponsored the workshop, the first in a series of three.
Two published papers on the controversial topic have identified a global change in temperature and weather, said Courtney Riordan of the EPA Resource and Development Office that sponsors a global climate research program.
The global temperature has risen six-tenths of a degree Celsius in a century, he said. That means more rain, hurricanes, typhoons and other extreme weather because warmer temperatures put more energy into the atmosphere, he said.
The worldwide rise in sea level and temperature probably will continue, said Robb Turner of the Center for Global Environmental Studies at Oak Ridge.
The planet was supposed to cool this century, Riordan said. The temperature increase lends weight to the theory that man and carbon dioxide are causing a greenhouse effect, he said.
Carbon dioxide, released by burning fossil fuels, has risen from 280 to 350 parts per million since the Industrial Revolution, he said. The global temperature might climb 4.5 degrees Celsius if the level hits 500, he said. Thanks to volcanoes, levels may have averaged 600 to 900 when dinosaurs and tropical fern forests dominated the planet.
"It's a big enough concern globally that this country is spending $1.3 billion a year to do research," Riordan said.
Wednesday's conference drew some of those researchers to discuss how well the future can be predicted and what questions most need to be asked. For instance, should the nation prepare for flooding or stop burning fossil fuels in order to slow climate change?
"Should Charleston County ban new condos on the coastline?" wondered Barbara Levinson of the EPA Global Climate Program in Washington, D.C.
Climate change intensely interests insurance companies, she said, and has far-reaching effects on such things as drinking water supplies, municipal planning and insect-borne disease.

Full text: Don't underestimate the threat of global warming The recent Berlin conference on climate change had to settle for a compromise agreement, but that shouldn't let anyone off the hook. We owe it to future generations to reduce our use of fossil fuels.
Monday, April 17, 1995
MAURICE STRONG
Toronto ONT -- BY MAURICE STRONG Toronto THE parties to the United Nations Climate Change Convention concluded their first conference two weeks ago in Berlin by patching together an agreement that satisfies no one, but that does keep the process of implementation and negotiation alive. It fulfills neither the best hopes of environmentalists and scientists - that the world would agree to substantially reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases linked to global warming - nor their worst fears.
The OPEC nations and their allies in the oil and coal industries were frustrated in their attempts to prevent agreement on dealing with greenhouse gases, byproducts of the burning of fossil fuels. But together with the reluctance of the United States, Canada and Australia to accept specific commitments, they contributed to a significant weakening of the final result.
After more than a week of divisive wrangling, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl turned the tide with his forthright statement opening the ministerial session, and his strong commitment to move beyond the agreements reached at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio (which undertook to stabilize greenhouse- gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000). Canadian Environment Minister Sheila Copps, making the best of a difficult brief, played a key role in negotiating the final compromise. And developing countries, splitting with the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries for the first time, played an encouragingly active and positive role.
Despite some uncertainties, particularly as to timing and consequences, there is a high degree of consensus among leading scientists that the risks of climate change are real and growing. The diagnosis is as reliable an indicator of potential risks to our collective future as a medical diagnosis can usually be in respect of our health as individuals.
Certainly it is sufficient to require precautionary action, particularly when such action is justified on economic, quite apart from environmental, grounds. The very active presence in Berlin of some of the world's leading insurance companies testified to the seriousness with which they regard the risks of climate change. On an issue that can decisively affect the future of life on Earth, surely it would be unwise, as well as unrealistic, to wait for the certainty that only a post-mortem could provide.
THE UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a diverse group of leading world experts, concluded in 1990 that the increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons) from human activities would result in a warming of the Earth's surface. In its latest report the panel reinforced the basic diagnosis of climate change, enunciated in 1992 and again last year.
It is short-sighted and misguided to suggest, as some have, that global warming brought about by human interference with the climate system will be beneficial. It is particularly naive and dangerous to postulate benefits to Canadian agriculture from climate warming. The marginal soils of the Arctic would not support agricultural production, to say nothing of the impacts that climate change would have on the fragile northern ecosystems.
Further, such change could give rise to net reductions in soil moisture and increased frequency of droughts, which would seriously harm existing agricultural areas. There could be improvements in some places, but the evidence points to overall changes that will be negative and costly.
Finally, the target of stabilizing greenhouse gases at 1990 levels by the year 2000 is only a start. The IPCC has indicated that stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide at one to two times today's concentrations (350 to 750 parts per million) can be attained only by reducing human-induced emissions substantially below 1990 levels.
In the short term, we must voluntarily adopt measures to use energy more efficiently, and in doing so reduce our use of fossil fuels and their associated emissions, primarily carbon dioxide. Delaying will only mean more drastic and costly regulatory measures later. In the longer term, we must move to renewable sources of energy while reducing the energy intensity of our economies and lifestyles - something that is entirely feasible.
Take Ontario Hydro. Our board of directors approved a long-term strategy for reducing the company's contributions to global greenhouse-gas emissions beyond the current requirements of governments. Hydro will reduce the rate of emission of those gases per terawatt-hour of useful energy supplied by 5 per cent by the year 2000 compared with the rate in 1990. The corporation will also stabilize net greenhouse-gas emissions from its operations at the 1990 base-line level by the year 2000, and reduce emissions by a further 10 per cent by 2005. This strategy is Ontario Hydro's voluntary contribution to Canada's National Action Program on Climate Change. We hope it will give governments confidence in developing their positions at home and internationally, and encourage other companies to adopt similar voluntary initiatives.
The silver lining in all this is the business opportunity provided by moving to an energy-efficient future. By becoming more energy-efficient, we not only protect the environment that sustains us but reduce our energy costs and improve our competitiveness. Only by restructuring our economy based on energy-efficient technologies and renewable sources of energy will we be able to ensure our long-term success in the global marketplace. The rapidly increasing demand for energy in developing countries offers promising business opportunities for investments that encourage energy efficiency and the development of environmentally sound renewable energy in these countries.
The measures to achieve sustainable development globally have to be taken largely at the national, local and personal levels. If we don't act now to provide our children with the collective life-insurance policy that is still affordable, all our individual efforts to protect their future could be negated. Maurice Strong is chairman of Ontario Hydro and served as secretary- general of the United Nations Earth Summit on the environment, held in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro.

Title: Don't underestimate the threat of global warming The recent Berlin conference on climate change had to settle for a compromise agreement, but that shouldn't let anyone off the hook. We owe it to future generations to reduce our use of fossil fuels.
