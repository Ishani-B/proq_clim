Abstract: WHAT, Americans worry? To the frustration of environmental activists, the still-distant risks from global warming have yet to grab the attention of Main Street. But to many economists, the difficulty in mobilizing public support to meet America's international commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 may yet prove a blessing.

Full text: In the corridors and meeting halls of the great debate over global warming, one faction is offering a straightforward plan for saving Earth's atmosphere.
Their technology would power the world through the 21st century without adding an ounce of heat-trapping gas to the skies. It doesn't rely on pipelines or supertankers. It's clean and dependable.
It has just one problem. But it's a big one. It's nuclear.
Wherever he can, the U.N. nuclear agency chief, Hans Blix, is spreading the message that governments will soon realize they must embark on "the era of expanded nuclear power." And in Washington, at least, the debate over climate change is spurring some to take another look.
Science advisors to President Clinton have recommended tripling the budget for nuclear-energy research. The White House, meanwhile, has moved to help the U.S. nuclear industry abroad, and Congress is trying to help it at home.
In Japan, too, powerful interests are rallying to make "nuclear" the main source of energy for the world's No. 2 economy.
Some anti-nuclear activists are convinced the industry will never overcome its image as uneconomical and risky. But others worry that global warming may be opening a window of opportunity.
"Nuclear Death Is No Answer to the Climate Disaster," declared a banner unfurled by protesters outside the general conference of Blix's International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.
Nuclear advocates hope the global warming conference beginning Monday in Japan will boost the industry's fortunes.
"The world's need for nuclear energy will essentially be the subtext of what goes on in Kyoto in December," said Steve Kerekes, spokesman for the U.S. industry's Nuclear Energy Institute.
In Kyoto, some 150 nations will try to negotiate reductions in such "greenhouse gases" as carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of coal, oil and natural gas in power plants worldwide. Scientists believe the gas buildup, trapping heat in the atmosphere, will disrupt Earth's climate.
Proposed solutions focus on improving energy efficiency and turning to solar, wind and other renewable energy sources. But Blix calls this a "dreamland" compared with nuclear energy's proven capacity.
France, for example, which uses atomic energy for almost three-quarters of its electricity, led Europe in reducing carbon dioxide emissions between 1980 and 1990, cutting them 26% on a per-capita basis.
Nuclear plants--442 in 30 countries, supplying 17% of the world's electricity--already keep man-made carbon dioxide emissions at least 8% below what they otherwise would be, says Blix's agency, which both guards against proliferation of nuclear weapons and promotes peaceful uses of the atom.
European and U.S. nuclear industry executives, appearing at pre-Kyoto talks last month in Germany, told delegates theirs was the "ready solution" for global warming.
The industry has been on a long losing streak, dogged by safety questions, an inability to dispose of its dangerous wastes and huge cost overruns. A U.S. plant would cost at least $4 billion to build; one that Turkey is planning is estimated at $2.4 billion or more.
Despite these troubles, construction started in 1996 on nine new power reactors, the most since 1985. All are in Asia, nuclear's new frontier.
China alone may spend $50 billion on nuclear power technology in the coming years, industry analysts say. A U.S.-Chinese agreement last month cleared the way for manufacturers in America, where no reactor has been sold since 1978, to cash in on Beijing's plans.
In another move to help the industry, the U.S. House and Senate have voted to create a storage facility for nuclear waste in Nevada.
Although U.S. global warming proposals do not envision expanding nuclear power's role, a White House experts' panel on energy, citing the risk of global warming, has recommended that the Energy Department's annual budget for nuclear fission research and development be tripled to $120 million by 2003.
It's "prudent insurance," said panel member Robert W. Conn, engineering dean at UC San Diego.
"If global warming is a major environmental issue . . . then one can hardly not consider the possibility that you may have to deploy some nuclear power as part of an overall strategy to reduce greenhouse gases," Conn said.
In Japan, which relies on fission for a third of its electricity, pro- and anti-nuclear voices grow louder as the Kyoto talks approach.
The influential Keidanren business federation has called for Japan to "position atomic energy as the central source among the various sources of basic energy."
The government, which says it is considering adding 20 plants to the 52 Japan already has, estimates that doubling the country's nuclear power output would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7% from 1990 levels.
But a series of accidents at atomic power plants this year undercut public support for nuclear power, and an accelerated buildup doesn't seem economically feasible. "This is absurd and unrealistic," anti-nuclear activist Jinzaburo Takagi said in Tokyo.
Takagi fears, nevertheless, that pro-nuclear forces will make inroads at Kyoto.
"The Japanese government wants to take advantage of international pressure on carbon emissions to advocate nuclear energy," he said.
As carbon dioxide spews heavenward, the industry bides its time.
"We've been treated with some disdain," said the nuclear institute's Kerekes. "But I think we're going to be something of a Cinderella."
Michael Oppenheimer, on the other hand, believes the industry will be more pumpkin than princess when midnight strikes in Kyoto.
"Nuclear has a big economic monkey on its back. It's too expensive," said the atmospheric expert for the Environmental Defense Fund. "They can say whatever they want. It can't overcome that economic problem."

Full text: Here are two conflicting views of the global warming issue:
From "Rising Sun, Gathering Winds; Policies to Stabilize the Climate and Strengthen Economies," by Christopher Flavin and Seth Dunn (Worldwatch Paper):
"Just as homeowners buy insurance to cope with potential dangers without knowing exactly how the future will unfold, so would governments be wise to invest in affordable means of slowing growth in greenhouse gas emissions in order to minimize the risks of climate change. . . .
"The threats that rapid climate change poses to society and the natural world are unprecedented. The temperature change resulting from the projected doubling of effective CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentrations in the next century could shift the ecological zones of one third of the world's forests northward at rates well beyond the maximum migration rates of most trees and shrubs, resulting in widespread forest death and wildfires.
"An increase in extreme weather, such as droughts and floods, is also likely to exacerbate water and food scarcity. At the same time, a 15-95 centimeter rise in sea level could turn people now living on islands and in coastal areas into environmental refugees. And the increase of heat waves and expanded range of infectious diseases, such as malaria and cholera, could cause health problems for millions."
***
From "The Scientific Case Against the Global Climate Treaty," by S. Fred Singer (The Science & Environmental Policy Project):
"The Global Climate Treaty, signed at the 1992 `Earth Summit' in Rio de Janeiro, rests on three propositions that are either questionable or demonstrably false:
"1. The Climate Treaty supposes that a human influence has been detected in the climate record of the last hundred years, thereby validating the computer-generated predictions of a major future warming. But the climate has not warmed significantly over the last half-century, and not at all over the last 20 years, in contrast to theoretical predictions.
"2. It further supposes that any future warming would produced catastrophic consequences, including droughts, floods, hurricanes, rapid and significant sea level rise, the collapse of agriculture, and the spread of tropical disease. But the recorded climate of the past 3,000 years appears to dispel that. Historically, warmer temperatures have been, on the whole, beneficial for human welfare and the development of civilization.
"3. It presumes - with no scientific definition - to know which atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases are `dangerous' and which are not. To stabilize CO2 concentration at present levels, 30 percent above pre-industrial values, would require a drastic reduction of emissions and energy use - more than 60 percent worldwide. But again, the historical record indicates that higher levels of CO2 - and they have been much higher in the past - may in fact provide benefits.
"Some scientists, including the late Roger Revelle, known as the father of greenhouse warming, have speculated that some of these benefits have already turned up in improved agricultural yields."

Full text:   Global warming debate, A-16 and Insight
Representatives of 150 nations are converging on this city of ancient temples to negotiate a 21st-century insurance policy for the planet, a deal to control energy use as a first installment on protecting the atmosphere against global warming.
"There are times when only an act of courage can spur progress in world affairs," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a statement wishing the conference success as it opens Monday.
Chief U.S. negotiator Stuart E. Eizenstat predicted a "movable feast" of compromises. If successful, the 10 days of negotiations could lead to shifts toward new-technology automobiles and fuel-saving driving habits, away from coal-powered electricity plants and toward new farming and forestry practices.
Such controls over carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse" gases could, in turn, begin to forestall the damaging rises in temperatures, sea levels and severe weather that scientists predict from global warming.
But almost every feature of this plan - including who should act, how and when - is in dispute. And powerful opposition has developed against early action, especially among oil-producing countries and U.S. coal, oil and other interests likely to be hurt. Industry lobbyists are among the thousands of diplomats, scientists, environmentalists and journalists assembling in Japan's old capital in the midst of unusually mild weather that has Japanese fretting that "global warming" may ruin their Winter Olympics in February in Nagano.
But the vagaries of any day's or month's weather cannot be attributed confidently to global climate change. And this imprecision among scientists has weakened the hand of those trying to combat the phenomenon.
At the 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil, the world's nations signed a Climate Change Treaty that, because of U.S. opposition, set only a voluntary goal: reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. It soon was clear most countries would miss that goal, and in 1995 governments agreed to negotiate legally binding targets and timetables.
The underlying principle of climate change is undisputed: Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and a few other gases, mostly from fuel combustion, are transparent to incoming sunlight but trap the heat that Earth emits.
In 1995, as atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide stood about 30 percent higher than in pre-industrial times, a U.N.-sponsored network of climate scientists issued a pivotal report, declaring global warming was under way and man was apparently partly to blame. Average temperatures had risen by up to 0.6 degrees Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) in the past century.
The scientists predicted growing emissions would boost temperatures 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 and raise sea levels 6 to 37 inches, inundating islands and shorelines because the warmth would expand ocean volume and melt glaciers. The warming also would shift climate zones and make regional weather wetter, drier and generally more turbulent, they said.
Critics have seized on the uncertainties of the projections to resist early action.
Key issues confronting the negotiators: Proposals to reduce industrial nations' emissions range from an ambitious 20 percent cutback below 1990 levels by 2005, to the low-end U.S. plan for reducing emissions to, but not below, 1990 levels by 2012.
Washington is pushing hard for a system of trading "emissions permits" so that a utility in Chicago could, in effect, continue burning coal by buying a permit from a country where it might prove cheaper to convert to more climate-friendly natural gas.
The U.S. team also is looking for ways to commit developing countries to emissions reductions.

Full text: In the corridors and meeting halls of the great debate over global warming, one faction is offering a straightforward plan for saving Earth's atmosphere.
Their technology would power the world through the 21st century without adding an ounce of heat-trapping gas to the skies. It doesn't rely on pipelines or supertankers. It's clean and dependable.
It has just one problem. But it's a big one. It's nuclear.
Wherever he can, the U.N. nuclear agency chief, Hans Blix, is spreading the message that governments will soon realize they must embark on "the era of expanded nuclear power." And in Washington, at least, the debate over climate change is spurring some to take another look.
Science advisers to President Clinton have recommended tripling the budget for nuclear-energy research. The White House, meanwhile, has moved to help the U.S. nuclear industry abroad, and Congress is trying to help it at home.
In Japan, too, powerful interests are rallying to make "nuclear" the main source of energy for the world's No. 2 economy.
Some anti-nuclear activists are convinced the industry will never overcome its image as uneconomical and risky. But others worry that global warming may be opening a window of opportunity.
"Nuclear Death Is No Answer To The Climate Disaster," declared a banner unfurled by protesters outside the general conference of Blix's International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria.
Nuclear advocates hope the global warming conference beginning Monday in Japan will boost the industry's fortunes.
"The world's need for nuclear energy will essentially be the subtext of what goes on in Kyoto in December," said Steve Kerekes, spokesman for the U.S. industry's Nuclear Energy Institute.
In Kyoto, some 150 nations will try to negotiate reductions in such "greenhouse gases" as carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of coal, oil and natural gas in power plants worldwide. Scientists believe the gas buildup, trapping heat in the atmosphere, will disrupt Earth's climate.
Proposed solutions focus on improving energy efficiency and turning to solar, wind and other renewable energy sources. But Blix calls this a "dreamland" compared with nuclear energy's proven capacity.
France, for example, which uses atomic energy for almost three-quarters of its electricity, led Europe in reducing carbon dioxide emissions between 1980 and 1990, cutting them 26% on a per-capita basis.
Nuclear plants 442 in 30 countries, supplying 17% of the world's electricity already keep man-made carbon dioxide emissions at least 8% below what they otherwise would be, says Blix's agency, which both guards against proliferation of nuclear weapons and promotes peaceful uses of the atom.
European and U.S. nuclear industry executives, appearing at pre-Kyoto talks last month in Germany, told delegates theirs was the "ready solution" for global warming.
The industry has been on a long losing streak, dogged by safety questions, an inability to dispose of its dangerous wastes and huge cost overruns. A U.S. plant would cost at least $4 billion to build; one that Turkey is planning is estimated at $2.4 billion or more.
Despite these troubles, construction started in 1996 on nine new power reactors, the most since 1985. All are in Asia, nuclear's new frontier.
China alone may spend $50 billion on nuclear power technology in the coming years, industry analysts say. A U.S.-Chinese agreement last month cleared the way for manufacturers in America, where no reactor has been sold since 1978, to cash in on Beijing's plans.
In another move to help the industry, the U.S. House and Senate have voted to create a storage facility for nuclear waste in Nevada.
Although U.S. global warming proposals do not envision expanding nuclear power's role, a White House experts' panel on energy, citing the risk of global warming, has recommended the Energy Department's annual budget for nuclear fission research and development be tripled to $120 million by 2003.
It's "prudent insurance," said panel member Robert W. Conn, engineering dean at the University of California at San Diego.
"If global warming is a major environmental issue . . . then one can hardly not consider the possibility that you may have to deploy some nuclear power as part of an overall strategy to reduce greenhouse gases," Conn said.
As carbon dioxide spews heavenward, the industry bides its time.
"We've been treated with some disdain," said the nuclear institute's Kerekes, "but I think we're going to be something of a Cinderella."
Michael Oppenheimer, on the other hand, believes the industry will be more pumpkin than princess when midnight strikes in Kyoto.
"Nuclear has a big economic monkey on its back. It's too expensive," said the atmospheric expert for the Environmental Defense Fund. "They can say whatever they want. It can't overcome that economic problem."

Energy use first topic of planetary powwow
Increasing emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and some other gases into the atmosphere trap heat in a "greenhouse effect." They are transparent and allow sunlight in but retain heat the Earth emits, with some escaping back toward space. A look at the process: GLOBAL WARMING
Representatives of 150 nations are in Kyoto, Japan, to try to hammer out a deal to protect the atmosphere against global warming into the 21st century.
By Charles J. Hanley
Associated Press
KYOTO, Japan - Representatives of 150 nations are converging on this city of ancient temples to negotiate a 21st-century insurance policy for the planet, a deal to control energy use as a first installment on protecting the atmosphere against global warming.
The talks are highly technical and complex, the politics challenging.
"There are times when only an act of courage can spur progress in world affairs," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a statement wishing the conference success as it opens Monday.
Chief U.S. negotiator Stuart E. Eizenstat predicted a "moveable feast" of hard-fought compromises.
If successful, the 10 days of negotiations could lead in a decade or so to shifts toward new-technology automobiles and fuel-saving driving habits, away from coal-powered electricity plants, and toward new farming and forestry practices.
Such controls over carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse" gases could, in turn, begin to forestall the damaging rises in temperatures, sea levels and severe weather that scientists predict from global warming.
But almost every feature of this 21st-century plan - including who should act, how and when - is in dispute. And powerful opposition has developed against early action, especially among oil-producing countries and U.S. coal, oil and other interests likely to be hurt.
Industry lobbyists are among the thousands of diplomats, scientists, environmentalists and journalists assembling in Japan's old capital in the midst of unusually mild weather that has Japanese fretting that "global warming" may ruin their Winter Olympics in February in Nagano.
But the vagaries of any day's or month's weather cannot be attributed confidently to global climate change. And this imprecision among scientists has weakened the hand of those trying to combat the phenomenon.
At the 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil, the world's nations signed a Climate Change Treaty that, because of U.S. opposition, set only a voluntary goal: reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000.
It soon was clear most countries would miss that goal, and in 1995 governments agreed to toughen the treaty by negotiating legally binding targets and timetables. Several preliminary rounds of talks laid the groundwork for final discussions here over a treaty protocol.
The underlying principle of climate change is undisputed: Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and a few other gases, mostly from fuel combustion, are transparent to incoming sunlight but trap the heat that Earth emits back to space.
In 1995, as atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide stood about 30 percent higher than in pre-industrial times, a U.N.-sponsored network of climate scientists issued a pivotal report, declaring global warming was under way and man was apparently partly to blame. Global average temperatures had risen by up to 0.6 degrees Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) in the past century.
The scientists predicted growing emissions would boost temperatures an additional 1 and 3.5 degrees Celsius (2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, and raise sea levels 15 to 95 centimeters (6 to 37 inches), inundating islands and shorelines, because the warmth would expand ocean volume and melt glaciers.
The warming also would shift climate zones abruptly and make regional weather wetter, drier and generally more turbulent, they said.
Critics have seized on the uncertainties of the projections to resist early action.
"There's a danger of having policy driven by the worst-case scenario," complained the American Petroleum Institute's William O'Keefe, chairman of the Global Climate Coalition, a U.S. industry group that contends emission controls will throw hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work.
Environmentalists counter than even a degree more warming could be damaging - flooding much of low-lying, overcrowded Bangladesh, for example.
And the worst-case scenario could be calamitous for everyone, said Michael Oppenheimer of the U.S. Environmental Defense Fund.
"In the face of uncertainty, what do you do?" he asked. "Some are willing to take a gamble."
Key issues confronting the negotiators:
-Proposals to reduce industrial nations' emissions range from an ambitious 20 percent cutback below 1990 levels by 2005, to the low-end U.S. plan for reducing emissions to, but not below, 1990 levels by 2012. The Clinton administration says its plan would mean reductions of more than 25 percent in what U.S. emissions otherwise would be.
-Washington is pushing hard for a system of trading "emissions permits," so that a utility in Chicago could, in effect, continue burning coal by buying a permit from a country, such as Poland, where it might prove cheaper to cut emissions by converting to more climate-friendly natural gas.
-The U.S. team also is looking for ways to commit developing countries to emissions reductions.
The industrial world, largely responsible for the carbon buildup, agreed in 1992 to exempt poorer nations from cutbacks. But the U.S. Senate, fearing economic competition from China and others free to burn cheap coal, threatens to kill any treaty protocol that does not cover developing nations.
Eizenstat said his negotiators are working to extend commitments to a "critical mass" of developing countries. Wealthier U.S. friends, such as South Korea and Argentina, might opt to adhere to targets.
The protocol won't dictate how countries should cut back on emissions. But recommended solutions will include conversion to "hybrid" automobiles that phase out the internal combustion engine; improved mass transit; phasing out power plants relying on high-carbon coal; introducing new feeds for cattle, which emit major amounts of methane; and better protection for forests, which absorb carbon dioxide.

Full text: GENERATING enough electricity from wind, water and sun to provide light for homes and power for industry has long been the dream of environmentalists. And for just as long, the reality has been a disappointment.
But now, as representatives of 160 nations meet in the Japanese city of Kyoto to discuss greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, there is a feeling that maybe - just maybe - renewable energy's time has come.
In the past it appeared too expensive and risky to finance, and simply not efficient enough to compete with fossil fuels. But what was once a yawning gap between conventional and renewable sources has narrowed.
New technologies mean electricity generated from wind and municipal waste can, in certain cases, be as cheap and as easy to produce as with conventional fuels.
Many are sceptical about what Kyoto will achieve. But the issues the conference seeks to address are not going to go away. And the British renewable energy industry stands at a crossroads.
While the coal industry is on its knees and losing friends in government, supporters of renewable energy believe the wind is blowing firmly in their direction. The Government has instigated a comprehensive review of the renewable energy sector and is committed to quadrupling the production of electricity from such sources over the next 13 years.
At the moment, just over 2.5 per cent of Britain's electricity comes from renewable sources such as gas from household waste and wind power. Labour says it wants this to reach 10 per cent by 2010. And a European Commission White Paper, out last week, set an even more ambitious target, 12 per cent.
The challenge of meeting these targets is huge, and implies a revolution in the UK's entire energy policy.
In recent months, oil giants BP and Shell have between them invested hundreds of millions of pounds in solar power and other alternative energy sources, such as burning specially grown timber.
Some dismiss this as public relations gimmickry: after all, they invest billions rather than millions in the development of fossil fuels. But BP chief executive John Browne has gone on record as saying that in 50 years' time, half the world's energy could be provided by renewable sources.
At the moment, BP's turnover from solar business is pounds 50 million a year. But that is expected to rise to pounds 600m a year by 2010. Shell believes that by 2020 the renewables market will be worth around pounds 148bn. The Government's own figures suggest the world market for renewable energy will reach pounds 40bn by 2000.
Dr Jeremy Leggett, chairman of the Government's solar power taskforce, says: 'The big difference today is we are now getting blue-chip players involved. It is giving the industry a new degree of credibility.'
But it's not just the oil majors who are having to face up to the new reality. Insurance companies including General Accident and GRE, already hit by claims from unexpected storms, are worried that dramatic climate change will lead to massive storm-damage claims in the future. They have joined up with the Government taskforces to examine the potential of renewable energy.
Yet while the political and public will appears to support a significant expansion of this sector, achieving the ambitious targets will depend on a successful overhaul of the complex system which takes electricity generated from renewable sources into our homes.
Eight years ago, it was believed that because renewable energy was more expensive than conventionally generated power, it had to be supported if it were to get off the ground. In 1989, the Conservative government introduced a mechanism known as the non-fossil fuel obligation - NFFO, pronounced nuffo. The Government would order the regional electricity companies (Recs) to buy a certain amount of renewable-sourced power.
Typical projects include generation from landfill gas, household and industrial waste, hydro-electric plants and wind - solar power is still too expensive. The Recs would then sign a 15-year contract to buy the power.
The buyers - the Recs - were then given a subsidy to cover the gap between what they were paying for this electricity and the cheapest price at which they could have bought on the open market. The subsidy came from a levy on all electricity bills amounting to just over 1 per cent.
The NFFO system is still in place. And last week, energy minister John Battle announced a new, fifth round of NFFO - the final one before the Government review.
There has been some criticism of the NFFO system, but it has at least created a market for supplying renewable energy and driven down costs by encouraging the most efficient producers.
Such has been the change in the economics of renewable energy, that Dr Catherine Mitchell of the Science Policy Research Unit believes the regional electricity companies no longer need to be subsidised for using the cheapest renewable sources.
'Electricity companies should simply be forced to take a certain amount of power from renewable resources,' she says. 'This can be done through a change in their licence conditions. They should then just pay a price that reflects the costs of that electricity.'
The advantage of such a reform would be that it would not require any primary legislation and could be undertaken by the electricity regulator.
To reach the Government target of obtaining 10 per cent of electricity through renewables by 2010 will require an increase in renewable capacity of around 350 megawatts every year.
But can this be done? Many renewable projects have failed to get off the ground because of the problems of winning planning permission. Of the 619 contracts that have been awarded under NFFO, only 208 are up and running, producing just 470 megawatts. While wind farms and energy-from-waste generators may enjoy public support, nobody wants them in their back yards. Because of this, many see wind turbines located off-shore as the best way forward for the UK.
The problem is that such turbines are expensive. PowerGen's ambitious plan to build a wind farm at Scroby Sands off the Norfolk coasts did not get a NFFO contract because it was too costly.
Chancellor Gordon Brown is rumoured to be happy about proposals to allow pounds 150m a year to be spent on renewables, and many hope a large slice of this will go to support the offshore-wind sector.
There is also another exciting prospect for the renewables industry. From next April competition begins in the residential electricity market and households will be able to shop around for their power supplier.
Already companies including Eastern and Sweb are offering special 'green' tariffs. These will allow environment-conscious customers to pay a bit more (about 10 per cent) on their electricity bills to fund renewable energy projects.
The Parliamentary Renewable & Sustainable Energy Group found that 86 per cent of the public would rather buy electricity generated in an environment-friendly way. Good news for Greens? Yes, except that only 21 per cent of people would be prepared to pay extra for it. Still, with 24 million electricity users, there must be enough green consumers out there to warrant further investment in renewables.

Abstract: The U.S., for example, promised at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio to cut its carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Instead, U.S. carbon emissions are 13 per cent higher than in 1990, and Washington is now saying that it can't get back down to the target figure until 2013. What happened? What went wrong? Basically, [Clinton] belatedly realized that U.S. fossil-fuel producers, in alliance with other major industries that worry about higher energy costs, control enough U.S. senators to block any treaty that hurts their interests. So rather than fight a hopeless battle, he has chosen pre-emptive surrender. Without a serious American offer on cutting emissions, none of the other holdouts at Kyoto will be under any pressure to yield, for the U.S. is the most flagrant polluter of all (four per cent of the world's population, 24 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions). So the best that can be hoped for at Kyoto is dramatic failure.

Full text: frogs in a pot, we can't sense what's coming' THE UNITED NATIONS Climate Summit that opens in Kyoto, Japan, on Monday will probably not end in a flaming row. Countries must not lose face, and so they are more likely to cobble together some shoddy compromise that is worth nothing. But a spectacular failure would be much better, for at least it might get the donkey's attention. Or more precisely, the frog's attention. Environmentalists often compare human behavior to that of frogs - who, if you drop them into a pot of boiling water, will jump right out again and survive. But sit afrog in a pot of cool water, raise the heat gradually, and he'll sit there happily until he boils to death.
Are humans really like frogs? Of course they are. Take Malaysians, for example.
The haze is gone from Malaysia now, but the cabaret group Instant Cafe is still getting a lot of mileage out of it. They were playing a corporate function in Kuala Lumpur last weekend - people who'd coughed and wept their way through the haze for all of September and October - and the audience rocked with laughter when they did their Haze song.
Come and visit Malaysia.
Come and stay for lots of days.
You don't need your suntan lotion.
You'll be safe from UV rays.
No need to sunbathe by the ocean.
Get dark by strolling in our haze.
The "haze" is mostly smoke from the thousands of forest fires that are set in Indonesia every dry season: first you log out any commercially valuable trees, then you burn the rest because that's the cheapest way to clear the land for cultivation. The smoke from huge areas of burning forest drifts over neighboring Malaysia, blocking out the sun and causing respiratory disorders.
Yet few Malaysians think they can do anything about it, because they know that the companies that are setting most of the fires in Indonesia have close links with President Suharto's government in Jakarta, and generally get their way.
They are also vaguely aware that destroying the forests raises the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming. But that problem isn't affecting their daily lives yet, and they have lots of present worries to keep them busy.
People in large industrialized democracies like the United States like to think they are different: better information, more open societies, a more educated public. But in fact they are equally captive to special interest groups.
The U.S., for example, promised at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio to cut its carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Instead, U.S. carbon emissions are 13 per cent higher than in 1990, and Washington is now saying that it can't get back down to the target figure until 2013. What happened?
The Clinton administration knows what it should do. At a preparatory meeting of the climate change conference in Geneva earlier this year, the U.S. mobilized the world's big insurance companies, who proved that global warming was already hitting their balance sheets in terms of soaring claims for storm damage.
That debunked the "junk science" (paid for by fossil-fuel producers) that pretends global warming is just an unproven hypothesis. With the European Union offering emission cuts to 15 per cent below 1990 levels by 2010 and the U.S. government also apparently on board, success in Kyoto seemed within reach.
What went wrong? Basically, Clinton belatedly realized that U.S. fossil-fuel producers, in alliance with other major industries that worry about higher energy costs, control enough U.S. senators to block any treaty that hurts their interests. So rather than fight a hopeless battle, he has chosen pre-emptive surrender.
Just as in Jakarta, the tail is wagging the dog. Many more Americans have an interest in curbing global warming than in the industries that cause it, but the majority is less conscious of its interests: the water in the pot is getting hotter, but only gradually. So the prospective victims exert less political pressure, and the other side gets its way.
Without a serious American offer on cutting emissions, none of the other holdouts at Kyoto will be under any pressure to yield, for the U.S. is the most flagrant polluter of all (four per cent of the world's population, 24 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions). So the best that can be hoped for at Kyoto is dramatic failure.
The Europeans should stick to their 15 per cent cuts proposal and make no compromises. They won't get their way, but that will at least ensure that the problem isn't shelved for five years after a cynical deal that leaves everyone free to do whatever they want.
Complete failure would at least make everybody come back for another conference next year. In the meantime, we should pray for weather so extreme that it wakes the frogs up.

Canada limps into Kyoto arena
GLOBAL WARMING / Former environmental leader 'spent five years fiddling while everyone else moved on.'
Friday, November 28, 1997
The Globe and Mail
IT was 1988, and Canada was trying hard to be green.
At a pathbreaking conference in Toronto, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney called for an international law of the atmosphere to curb the human impact on the world's climate.
The next year, Lucien Bouchard, as federal environment minister, warned Canadians to prepare to change their lifestyles "radically" to combat global warming. Then, at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Canada pledged to reduce emissions of climate-changing gases to 1990 levels by 2000.
Today, the federal cabinet is having trouble deciding on its negotiating stand, just three days before the opening of the most crucial set of climate-change talks since Rio.
A news conference planned for today in Ottawa to announce Canada's position was abruptly cancelled last night, underscoring the indecision of a country that was once seen as a leader on environment issues.
Whatever role Canada chooses to play at the talks opening Monday in Kyoto, Japan, its image will take on a decidedly brownish cast.
Canada has failed spectacularly to meet its own targets for cuts in emissions. It has taken only timid steps to reduce fossil-fuel consumption.
And if the Kyoto meeting agrees on measures that offer economic opportunities as well as economic costs, Canada is increasingly likely to end up scrambling to adapt instead of breaking the trail.
"We spent five years fiddling while everyone else moved on," said Douglas Russell, a senior Canadian climate-change negotiator from 1991 to 1996 who resigned partly out of frustration at the lack of agreement among governments and industries on the issue.
The 10-day Kyoto conference is shaping up as a battle between industrialized countries and the developing world over who should bear the cost of actions to combat the threat of global warming.
But the final agreement may reward industrial nations that agree to help poorer countries become more energy-efficient.

  

The industrial nations would do this by exporting environmental technology or expertise. That could benefit European countries and the United States, which have made greater strides than Canada since the Rio summit in forging environmental links with the developing world.
Kyoto is the third in a series of conferences after the adoption in Rio of a global climate-change treaty. Its focus is setting mandatory limits on greenhouse gases, so called because they block the release of heat into outer space from the atmosphere.
Most human-created GHGs are produced through the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gasoline, natural gas and coal. Other sources include aerosol sprays and methane from agriculture and garbage dumps.
Most climate scientists believe human activity, including greenhouse-gas production, has helped increase the Earth's average surface temperature over the past century. Many predict drastic consequences for people and industries if the planet continues to warm up.
Climate also is influenced by natural phenomena, and the precise human contribution to global warming is not known. But Canada and most other governments say they have enough evidence to conclude that some kind of action is needed.
"We now are going to have to make important decisions about the future without having absolute proof," said John Fraser, a former Progressive Conservative cabinet minister who is now Canada's special ambassador for the environment. "And I don't think it's beyond our intellectual capacity."
It's not the details of carbon atoms, sulphur aerosols or computerized climate models that will drive the debate at Kyoto. It's the strategic interest, both economic and environmental, of countries and negotiating blocs.
Each nation's position will be shaped by the answers to three questions: How grave is the threat to us from climate change? How much will it cost us to adapt? And what opportunities does the future offer?
Potential threats are almost endless.
A warming-induced rise of a metre in sea levels would swamp some island nations and leave millions homeless along coastlines, where much of the world's population growth is taking place. Rising temperatures could melt permafrost, extend the range of insect pests, affect forests and make storms more severe.
Estimates of the cost of reducing emissions vary greatly. Since the easiest way to cut GHGs would be to reduce fossil-fuel consumption, potential effects include higher prices for gasoline and electric power, and higher costs for job-creating industrial projects.
Four projections summarized in a recent Conference Board of Canada report forecast that stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels would cut between 0.5 and 2.3 percentage points off Canada's projected 30-per-cent economic growth between now and 2010.
But costs are hard to predict, because so many other factors affect the course of the economy. The mix of energy sources in each country is crucial, as are urban planning, transportation and energy-pricing policies.
Costs could be offset if, as U.S. President Bill Clinton has urged, delegates at Kyoto agree to work toward a permit-trading system, which would allow countries that reduced emissions quickly to sell unused quotas to those lagging behind. Possible benefits include increased trade involving environmental products and a reduction, in both rich and poor countries, of pollution unrelated to climate change that is also caused by burning fossil fuels.
Several emissions targets have been proposed in the months leading to Kyoto. The toughest, a 20-per-cent cut from 1990 levels by 2005, comes from the Alliance of Small Island States. The weakest is put forward by Australia, which wants to be allowed to boost its own emissions 18 per cent by 2010. That reflects a well-developed, energy-intensive economy with coal as its major export.
The 15-nation European Union proposes a 15-per-cent emissions cut, but says it will achieve this as a group, with its poorer members, such as Portugal and Greece, allowed more leeway than Germany and Britain. Japan is expected to propose a 5-per-cent cut.
Prime Minister Jean Chrétien is reportedly seeking to take a tougher stand than the United States, but Canada's position is not expected to differ significantly from that of its major trading partner.
In fact, the U.S. position is crucial to the entire Kyoto meeting.
The United States produces nearly 24 per cent of worldwide carbon-dioxide emissions, more than any other country. Its per-person share, nearly 20 tonnes a year, is also among the highest. No deal will be worth much unless the United States signs it.
Mr. Clinton surprised many last year when he endorsed mandatory emission controls. Washington now favours stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels by 2012,and is aggressively promoting the idea of countries being able to buy or sell emissions quotas.
U.S. negotiators also will demand that developing countries commit themselves to control emissions.
The U.S. Senate has declared that it will refuse to ratify any deal that lacks such guarantees. For some senators, such as those representing coal-producing states, that position may simply be a ploy to head off any agreement. But there are firm reasons for demanding such pledges from the developing world, which includes some of the world's biggest producers of greenhouse gases.
China, with nearly 15 per cent of the total, is No. 2. South Korea produces almost as much as France. With rapidly expanding heavy industries, such countries are expected to be major contributors during the next century.
"The real deal breaker is how to get the developing countries on board,"said Mr. Russell,who is now a partner in Global Change Strategies International Ltd., an Ottawa consulting firm.
Formally, the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America form a negotiating bloc, but it includes everything from the small island states to oil-exporting Middle Eastern nations, which abhor the idea of cuts in fossil-fuel use.
The climate-change debate is a replay of earlier environmental controversies. Poor countries say universal mandatory targets would hobble their prosperity and force them to pay for the excesses of European and North American industry over the past two centuries.
Eventually, Mr. Russell said, the right mixture of incentives might persuade poor countries to agree to mandatory targets.
These could include emissions-quota trading and so-called joint-implementation agreements, under which rich countries would get credit for helping poor countries cut their emissions. Credit could also be given for increasing the area of "carbon sinks" such as forests, which reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
But delegates in Kyoto might have to settle for a deal that sets targets now for developed countries but merely prolongs the negotiating process for the developing world.
Technically speaking, the meeting will seek agreement on a protocol for action under the treaty signed in Rio, known as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It would not come into effect until a specified number of countries ratified it. Delays of two or three years are not uncommon before international treaties take effect.
Still unclear is how mandatory controls would be enforced. Violators could lose voting rights in future treaty talks, or be barred from participating in permit trading. More extreme measures could include trade sanctions.
Any mandatory scheme adopted at Kyoto will force Canada's federal and provincial governments to do what they've been reluctant to do since Rio: decide who would pay the costs involved in achieving targets, and who would be "If the protocol put forward in Kyoto is not in Canada's interest, if it doesn't justify the risk and have support in Canadian society . . . Canada should be prepared not to sign it," Jim Hughes, manager of energy analysis for Imperial Oil Ltd., told a seminar audience in Toronto last week.
At the other end of the scale are insurance companies, whose mounting losses from storms and floods are persuading them that climate change is a real threat.

Warning: Human-induced changes in Earth's climate may affect health and economic prospects.

  

Response: Talks opening Monday in Kyoto, Japan, will seek agreement on a program of cuts in fossil-fuel use and other measures.

  

Reaction: Uncertainty about climate change makes it hard to pinpoint what is needed. Severe cuts could do more harm than good by restricting economic growth.

  

Counter-reaction: The process offers a chance to get moving on environmental programs that have the potential to create growth and jobs.

Factoring in the human influence
Climate change is "something that governments will need to visit over and over"
The past 18 months have seen a remarkable shift by industry lobbyists away from the argument that climate change is too uncertain to warrant fighting the problem.
A consensus has settled around the view of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change , the scientists researching the problem for governments, that "the balance of evidence suggests there is a discernible human influence on global climate".
But the implications for multi-billion dollar industries that stand to lose from measures taken to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels has made climate science one of the most politically-charged areas of scientific research. At the other end of the spectrum, the insurance industry, which believes it has the most to lose from inaction, has mobilised in support of tough emission cuts.
Just over a year ago, the World Energy Council , representing the energy industries of 100 countries, and the US Global Climate Coalition , were accusing the IPCC of distorting the evidence in a summary for policy makers.
Michael Jefferson, deputy secretary-general of the WEC, recently stood by his criticisms of the IPCC for not sticking with an original wording which said "the body of statistical evidence ... now points towards a discernible influence" of humans on climate.
But the WEC has since focused on both the difficulties and opportunities for promoting more efficient energy use to tackle climate change. Even US industry lobbyists, who have put heavy pressure on President Bill Clinton not to agree any greenhouse gas emission curbs at the conference on climate change in Kyoto next month, have changed tack.
Instead of openly attacking the integrity of the IPCC, which it last year accused of "scientific cleansing", the Global Climate Coalition has switched its focus to what one analyst described as the "soft underbelly" of Kyoto.
This is the contention, emphasised by a $13m television advertising campaign by US industry lobbyists, that developing nations are under no obligation to agree emission cuts expected of industrialised nations.
The change of target was in response to increasing public concern about the climate, a growing divergence of views within industry and a sharp rebuff by the US administration last year to "naysayers and special interests bent on . .. obfuscating climate change science".
The din over the basic science may have died down, but the the fact is that very little is known about the effect of climate change on the world.
"I can understand that politicians are at a loss as they don't have anything tangible to pin their arguments on," says Prof Bert Bolin, the IPCC's outgoing president.
The IPCC says the planet's average surface temperature could rise by up to 3.5 degree centigrade and sea levels by half a metre by 2100 if emissions of greenhouse gases, the most important of which is CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels, increase unabated.
This would see emissions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, currently at 360 parts per million by volume (ppmv), rising to 700ppmv by the end of the century, compared to a pre-industrial level of 280ppmv.
As well as rises in temperature and sea levels, some areas would suffer greater rainfall and others increased drought.
The "ideal" option in terms of greenhouse gases would be a return to pre-industrial levels which existed before the big increase in fossil fuel consumption which is thought to be affecting climate. But even IPCC scientists acknowledge this is not feasible, if only because it would deny developing countries the right to grow even if industrialised nations drastically cut emissions.
But if energy efficiency is increased and there is a shift to renewable energy, emissions could go up by 10-20 per cent in first half of the next century and then stabilise at 450ppmv by the end of next century. Under that scenario, temperatures could still rise, but by a smaller average of 1.5C or 2C by 2100. Sea levels could rise 20cm to 30cm.
As if that were not bad enough, it is also likely that climate change is already happening. Independent information suggests that a rise of between 0.3C and 0.6C in temperatures since the late 19th century is greater than anything over previous centuries.
Tom Karl, senior scientist at the National Climate Data Centre in Asheville, North Carolina, says that recent floods in the US have been consistent with what could be expected from global warming. Precipitation has increased by 10 per cent over the last century.
"We can't tell you this trend is going to be catastrophic but the changes are not inconsistent with the notion that they could be catastrophic," he said.
The uncertainty means the Kyoto conference is likely to be nothing but a first step towards mitigating the potential effects of climate change.
But there are two reasons for beginning to act early: first, carbon dioxide emitted now will stay in the atmosphere for at least 100 years and second, reductions begun now could reduce the need for precipitate action later.
Policymakers point to other benefits to the environment - for instance by reducing air pollution also caused by the consumption of fossil fuels - even if such policies prove inappropriate for climate change.
As scientific knowledge improves, climate change, according to Mr Karl, is "something that governments will need to visit over and over again to adjust policies accordingly". Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

Nothing quite like the sun
Japan and the US have adopted a more aggressive role to advance solar power
Solar energy from photovoltaic panels could be the single most important long-term means of achieving the deep cuts in the greenhouse gas emissions associated with climate change.
This at least is the claim made by the UK government's solar industry task force earlier this month.
But to take advantage of the fledgling technology's "explosive growth (expected) sometime early in the next century" it urged the government to stimulate investment in the technology in order to drive down costs. Building up domestic manufacturing capacity would enable Britain to capture a promising export market while creating new jobs at home in a labour-intensive industry .
The alternative of "allowing our competitors to corner an excessive share of the global market ... would effectively be ceding domestic jobs to them", warned the task force.
Its members include two UK manufacturers, BP Solar and Intersolar, plus banks and insurance companies which increasingly perceive the potential effects of climate change as a threat to their business.
The group is chaired by Jeremy Leggett, a former environmentalist who has also set up Solar Century , a global purchasing club for solar power which is the sort of private sector initiative traditionally preferred by the UK.
But a few governments, namely the US and Japan, two of the foreign competitors cited by the task force, have opted for more aggressive market-forcing programmes. These attempt to drive down the costs of solar versus conventional energy through government procurement or pump-priming.
Japan, host of the December 1-10 inter-governmental conference in Kyoto on climate change, has led the way with a plan to install solar roofs on 70,000 homes by 2002. It is home to Kyocera , a market leader in emerging international solar markets.
In June, the US administration unveiled a programme to install 1m solar roofs in the US by 2010 although the details of how it proposes to do so are unclear.
The UK government meanwhile is reviewing its policy on renewables which it wants to generate 10 per cent of the country's electricity needs by 2010. But it is waiting for the outcome of the Kyoto meeting before publishing the review's conclusions early next year.
Michael Meacher, environment minister, recently appeared to rule out suggestions that the government provide £18m annual support sought by the British Photovoltaic Association . In return the industry had offered to build £100m manufacturing capacity in the UK.
British Petroleum , whose subsidiary BP Solar , with 10 per cent of the market, is the world's third biggest producer of photovoltaic panels, believes that with "appropriate government support and investment" solar can become competitive in supplying peak electricity demand within the next 10 years.
But Mr Meacher, appearing to foreshadow the outcome of the review, said solar power was still too "expensive" to justify UK subsidies on the scale sought by the British Photovoltaic Association and it would only come into its own in "five or 10 years time". The government believes it will get more value for money in the meantime by promoting wind power and more efficient use of fossil fuels.
Chris Rose, deputy director of Greenpeace UK , the environmental pressure group, argues, however, that "there's only so much belt- tightening you can do with the consumption of fossil fuels" in order to combat climate change.
Once these gains have been made, renewables such as solar will be necessary to drive greenhouse gas emissions down to the level required seriously to mitigate climate change.
The British Photovoltaic Association concedes that "PV is not expected to become competitive as a pure generation source under UK conditions for the foreseeable future", with one exception - photovoltaic panels, "high-grade architectural claddings costing £600-£1,000 per square metre".
This use is at the crux of Mr Leggett's Solar Century, which is trying to recruit banks and insurance companies to install PV panels as cladding on office buildings.
And Mr Leggett says there is much more the UK government can do to support the industry without handing out large subsidies.
Apart from tax breaks, these include introducing mandatory requirements for new construction to contain a minimum amount of solar in suitable buildings and easing of planning permission for projects including PV.
In the absence of significant government support, however, private UK companies are likely to focus on chasing foreign business as best they can.
One solar market that is already viable is the electrification of remote communities in the Third World. Solar technology was the best way to generate electricity "for millions of households in the developing world," the Washington-based World Watch Institute said in Shining Examples, a report detailing local schemes which help finance the panels' installation.
British Petroleum plans to increase its sales of photovoltaic panels 10-fold to $1bn a year over the next decade. John Browne, BP's chief executive, noted recently that although there was sufficient sunlight to generate all the energy the world needs, it now generates only 0.001 per cent of the total.
By 2020 however he believes that up to 5 per cent of world energy could be supplied by renewable energy such as solar power. More recently, Royal Dutch / Shell , the world's biggest oil company, joined the fray with an announcement that it would spend $500m on developing a fifth core business in renewables including solar.
Established participants such as BP, are worried less about newcomers, such as Shell, than about existing competitors such as Kyocera which stand to receive a big boost from the Japanese government.
The proprietary nature of much of the technology also means that even Shell will be hard-placed to break into the market, says Bob Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer of Houston-based Enron Renewable Energy Corporation . Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

SCIENCE FICTION The day the Earth warmed up
We all learned in science class that hypotheses are supposed to be tested against observation. But in the global-warming debate, it appears this simple axiom does not apply: Climate change has become an article of faith
Saturday, November 22, 1997
Toronto -- A FUNNY thing happened on the way to the international global-warming conference: The Earth failed to heat up.
Yes, you heard correctly. Over the past decade, the Earth's average surface temperature has increased by zero. Nothing. Nada. In fact, there's evidence that it's actually cooled a bit.
But you wouldn't know that from the confusing media coverage of the climate-change question. The debate about whether the burning of fossil fuels is having any effect on the atmosphere has become increasingly polarized with the approach of the Dec. 1 summit in Kyoto, Japan, of the (take a deep breath) Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The Party delegates are not meeting to chew over the science of the issue. They already agreed in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and in Berlin in 1994, to stabilize the atmospheric release of heat-trapping "greenhouse gases," such as carbon dioxide and methane, at 1990 levels. This was to protect us from the supposed danger of being fried in a planetary convection oven. Rather, they are meeting to negotiate a legally binding deadline, likely extending the original voluntary one of the year 2000 by about 10 years.
The Europeans (for whom this is very much a trade issue because of their more diversified energy economies) are pushing hardest. U.S. President Bill Clinton supports the targets, but the U.S. position is that it won't sign the treaty unless developing nations, which will contribute to the greatest increase in emissions in the years to come, agree to some obligations in Kyoto.
Prime Minister Jean Chrétien apparently wants to outdo the Americans and, at a recent meeting, federal and provincial environment ministers agreed to endorse the UN stabilization plan and revised deadline. Only Quebec objected, saying the measures don't go far enough.
Yet Canada is behind the eight ball. Despite voluntary industry initiatives, Natural Resources Canada projects emissions will be 8.2 per cent higher in the year 2000 than in 1990, and 36 per cent higher by 2020. Reversing the trend will be costly. Emission limits, trade sanctions and special taxes could have a profound impact on Canada's resource-dependent economy, especially on the steel and aluminum industries, energy production, transportation, cattle farming and agriculture. To appease Alberta, Mr. Chrétien recently ruled out a well-head carbon tax, but other taxes could force retail fuel prices to soar.
This is serious stuff.
The Conference Board of Canada predicts compliance measures needed to return emissions to 1990 levels will reduce Canada's annual economic growth by $5.4-billion to $30-billion by the year 2010. An economic simulation prepared for Environment Canada by DRI/McGraw Hill suggests stabilization would require a phased-in 50-per-cent hike in energy prices.
As a result, between now and 2012, the economy could underperform to the tune of $150-billion, with living standards lowered by higher prices and interests rates, plus a weak Canadian dollar.
Though we will all be asked to accept such sacrifices, it's difficult for the lay person to determine whether or not the science behind the climate-change theory is sound. Environmentalists, some scientists and politicians argue -- passionately -- that the phenomenon is real. Oil companies, certain scientists and other politicians counter -- just as passionately -- that it's all a bunch of hooey.
Who's right?
The answer, of course, lies in the evidence. When I agreed to research and write this story, I had not formed an opinion one way or the other. But as this environmental detective story unfolded, I found that both sides -- the environmentalists and the industry lobby groups -- have been self-serving and subjective.
The evidence appears to have been tampered with, the jury rigged. Politicians, UN bureaucrats and some scientists have tried to discredit skeptical scientists (aren't scientists supposed to be skeptical?) for challenging the conventional wisdom.
We all learned in science class that hypotheses are supposed to be tested against observation. But in the global-warming debate, it appears this simple axiom does not apply: Climate change has become an article of faith.
The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change forecasts a rise in global temperature of between 0.8 and 3.5 degrees if something doesn't halt the doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere expected in the next century. (This is down from earlier estimates of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees).
By now, we're all familiar with the presumed Doomsday that will result if this happens. In a speech this month, Mr. Chrétien compared the oil companies to the tobacco giants in their denial of their products' harmful effects, then reminded his audience that, "If we do not take action, climate change will create droughts, floods and other disasters around the world. It will create unprecedented tides of refugees." He didn't belabour the other alleged consequences, which include: violent storms, tornadoes, forest fires, crop failures, rising sea levels and plagues spread by mosquitoes that will migrate into formerly frigid regions.

  

GLOBAL-warming theory originated in the writings of 19th-century French mathematician and scientist Jean Fourier, and was given modern credence in 1988 when NASA climatologist Jim Hansen testified before the U.S. Congress that the summer drought that year was attributable in part to global warming.
A number of groups soon discovered they could profit from the bad news. Environmental organizations such as Greenpeace have found the apocalyptic scenario is the best fundraising tool since baby seals. Greenpeace has organized expeditions at both ends of the Earth to report on everything from melting icecaps in Antarctica to thawing permafrost in the Mackenzie River Basin.
The Suzuki Foundation's Climate Change Campaign has run splashy ads calling global warming "the most urgent slow-motion catastrophe facing mankind." The mosquito story was given special emphasis in the ads, as was the opportunity to make donations. (The mosquito theory was recently discredited in the Nov. 7 issue of the journal Science.)
Government scientists have cashed in too. The U.S. government doles out more than $2-billion each year for researchers to study the issue. In Canada, government departments and universities have benefited from an $85-million Global Warming Strategy fund established in 1992 under the Federal Green Plan, among other revenues. This doesn't mean their agenda amounts to malfeasance; only that, with other funding spigots turned off, scientists in the public service have a vested interest in producing research that remains "inconclusive" so that they can continue to attract funding.
For many politicians, the scientific case is closed. On July 26, President Clinton opened a White House conference on the subject with the announcement that "The overwhelming balance of evidence and scientific opinion is that it is no longer a theory but now a fact that global warming is real." He cited the supposed consensus of 2,500 scientists in an oft-cited report of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Vice-President Al Gore seems to attribute every extreme weather event to global climate change. On one occasion, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt even stated that skeptics of the Clinton administration's global-warming proposals are "un-American in the most basic sense."
With these endorsements, is it any wonder ordinary folk are scared out of their wits and tell pollsters they support strong government action? However, before you start building your own sea wall against a future Water World, there are a few things to consider.
First, the growing "consensus of scientists" mentioned by Mr. Clinton (and just about every uncritical news story) is a complete myth. Climate change is hotly debated among scientists, and the list of skeptics is growing. Leading the charge are four renowned climatologists: Dr. Patrick J. Michaels of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, North Carolina; Dr. Robert Balling, a climatology professor at Arizona State University in Tempe; Dr. Richard Lindzen, Alfred P. Sloan professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston; and Dr. Fred Singer, distinguished research professor at George Mason University and professor emeritus of environmental science at the University of Virginia.
These four horsemen of the nonapocalypse speak at conferences, testify before Congress and publish papers that use real-world measurements to effectively skewer the computer-driven climate projections of their peers, including those of the UN panel. A few of them receive some funding from fossil-fuel companies and are therefore dismissed by environmentalists as industry shills or tools of the U.S. anti-environmental "wise use" movement.
But discrediting these scientists because of their funding instead of their work is hardly credible. Their papers are peer-reviewed and appear in respected journals such as Science and Nature. Less than 5 per cent of Dr. Singer's annual budget comes from oil companies (a $5,000 donation from Exxon). In fact, environmental groups themselves receive millions of dollars in corporate donations. Does this mean their message is tainted?
In any case, the evidence (as opposed to the theory) is increasingly supportive of the observations of these modern-day Galileos, once dismissed as a "small and noisy band of skeptics."
In 1995, the UN panel released a thick report containing sections in which scientists took pains to state that global warming and climate change are not yet proven. But politicians and environmental groups never quote these sections. Instead, they seize upon a statement -- that human activities are having a "discernible effect" on the atmosphere -- appearing in the Policymaker's Summary written by a small group that included UN bureaucrats and other non-scientists.
Says Dr. Patrick Michaels: "The 'discernible effect' statement may be politically sensational, but it's scientifically bankrupt." He and others accused the writers of the Policymaker's Summary of spin-doctoring and of deliberately playing down the high degree of scientific uncertainty about the global-warming theory.
Dr. Fred Singer argues that the report does not represent a "consensus of 2,500 scientists," pointing out that its 11 chapters were written by only about 80 authors. Most of the hundreds of "contributors" listed are simply experts who allowed their studies to be quoted without necessarily supporting the report's conclusions.
Says Dr. Frederick Seitz, "In my more than 60 years as a member of the American scientific community, including service as president of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Physical Society, I have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer-review process."
At an international meeting in 1995, 100 climatologists showed that they were fed up with the way bureaucrats had distorted their research by signing a Leipzig Declaration, which expressed their anger over the unreliable global-warming projections generated through computer-based General Circulation Models. Yet the politicians and the media continue to refer to the "consensus of scientists."
Climate-change skeptics agree that Earth's average temperatures have risen by a modest 0.3 to 0.6 degrees in the 140 years since records began. But they point out that most of this warming occurred before 1940 and was followed by decades of climate cooling, from about 1940 through the 1960s, at a time when greenhouse-gas emissions actually increased. Many climatologists feared the world was heading toward a mini-ice age. Even the UN panel's chairman Bert Bolin admits that the pre-1940 warming is probably a natural recovery from an earlier natural cooling.
Indeed, of the 96 years of this century, so far 32 show a warming trend and 64 a cooling. The warming has not been evenly distributed. Some parts of the globe have not warmed at all, while others, like Canada's interior and the Antarctic Peninsula, appear to have warmed by one and two degrees respectively.
But the most damning evidence concerns the past decade. Weather satellites have detected no increase at all. On the contrary, they indicate a cooling of 0.13 since 1979, and the data are independently verified by weather-balloon records as well as the readings of ground-level instruments calibrated to account for urban "heat island" effects.
Dr. Michaels is unequivocal: "The perfect agreement between the satellite data and the weather balloons has been extremely humiliating for the global-warming proponents . . . Even worse for them, the land-surface records of the past decade show a warming of zero."
But the other side is not backing down. Dr. Gordon McBean is assistant deputy minister in the atmospheric environmental service of Environment Canada and formerly chaired the international World Climate Research Program. While he doesn't dispute the accuracy of the satellite data, he feels the skeptics have reached the wrong conclusions. "It's inappropriate to judge long-term global-warming trends from satellite records that only began in about 1979," he says. Dr. McBean argues that changes in the atmosphere indicate that human actions are affecting the climate in ways that solar spots or volcanic activity would not. "Our computer models now give a reasonable simulation of the climate since about 1900 and, though the amount of climate change predicted varies, they all indicate it will occur."
Dr. Michaels observes that this kind of explanation is typical of "consensus" scientists. "Scientists are supposed to look at evidence, not run from it," he says, adding, "When the temperature didn't go up as predicted, the increasingly desperate and shrill apologists for the warming theory changed their mantra to the vague message of climate change." Dr. Michaels and other skeptics also point out that there is no evidence at all that Earth has suffered from an increase in violent weather. For instance, studies of anemometer readings used to gauge hurricanes since the Second World War show a decline in the strength of tropical storms, not an increase.
It's a touchy issue. Hurricane Andrew, in 1992, was the most expensive U.S. disaster ever, causing $30-billion (U.S.) in damage. But is this because the weather is worse or because more people inhabit Florida's coastline than decades ago? Atlantic hurricane activity over the warming period between 1970 and 1987 was less than half the activity observed for the cooling period between 1947 and 1969.
There is no consensus in the insurance industry that climate change is upon us. U.S. insurance and reinsurance companies (among the most affected) remain particularly skeptical. Even the UN panel report states: "Overall, there is no evidence that extreme weather events, or climate variability, have increased, in a global sense through the 20th century, although data and analysis are poor and not comprehensive."
Dr. Singer points out that: "A small rise in sea levels of about 18 centimetres per century has been observed for several centuries, but there is evidence that this derives from the drifting of continental plates and subsequent tectonic changes in the shape of the ocean basin, not from the thermal expansion of sea water." He says that during the warming period between 1900 and 1940, there was actually a drop in sea levels indicating that global warming, if it occurs, could in fact slow any rise in sea levels.
Another troubling question is one that the UN Intergovernmental Panel's report fully acknowledges: Even if the climate is changing, it's impossible to say to what (if any) extent human beings are influencing what might be natural variation.
Change is inevitable for climate, especially if one takes a long-term view. Ice ages occur roughly every 100,000 years, followed by warm periods lasting 10,000 to 12,000 years. Even the warm periods experience wild fluctuations. Between 5,000 and 8,000 years ago, Earth went through long periods that were two to three degrees hotter than today. Paleoclimatologists at the University of Maine have discovered from fossils that the climate of the Prairies took a sudden turn for the better about 800 years ago after 1,500 years of dust-bowl conditions. The abrupt change from dry to wet cycles, they say, may be connected to different moon and sun cycles. What is now the arid Sahara desert was once a swampy land populated by hippos and crocodiles.
Had a fine English wine recently? Doubtful. Yet, records show that a few hundred years ago England's climate was ideal for growing grapes. This was during a short-lived hot spell in the middle of what climatologists call the Little Ice Age, which lasted from the early 1400s to about 1850. This period suggests that cold climates, not warm, spawn the most violent weather. Severe storms in the North Sea in 1421 and 1446 claimed 100,000 lives, while a storm in 1570 claimed more than 400,000.
Earth temperatures closely correlate to sunspot and solar-flare activity, which occurs in cycles of roughly 11 years within much longer trends. When the number of sunspots was sharply reduced between 1640 and 1720, our planet cooled about 1.1 degrees and Europe was plunged into a deep freeze. Glaciers and winters lengthened, and English paintings from the time show people skating on the Thames River and celebrating freezings with Frost Fairs. In pioneer days, people walked in winter from Staten Island to Manhattan across a frozen New York harbour.
Experts at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington say that about 50 per cent of the climate change since 1850 can be attributed to the sun, and average temperatures since the Second World War have closely tracked sunspot cycles. Complicating matters, geophysicists at the University of Hawaii claim that increased undersea seismicity and volcanic activity on the Pacific Ocean floor may be contributing to the appearance of strong El Nino weather events in recent years.
So, what should we do?
The conclusion of Volume 3 of the UN Panel report states: "A prudent way to deal with climate change is through a portfolio of actions aimed at mitigation, adaptation and improvement of knowledge. The appropriate portfolio will differ for each country. The challenge is not to find the best policy today for the next 100 years, but to select a prudent strategy and to adjust it over time in light of new information."
That certainly sounds reasonable. Given all the evidence that contradicts the theory that the Earth is warming, that the climate is changing, and that mankind is the cause, perhaps the Canadian delegation in Kyoto should argue that the global-warming hypothesis needs to be revised. A prudent strategy for Canada would be to monitor the situation, but any decision to limit greenhouse-gas emissions would be premature and should be shelved.

Full text: Ran with factboxes "Health risks of global warming" which has been appended to the end of this story.
Here come the bugs: The biggest increase ever recorded in water surface temperature off the West Coast portends the arrival of a slew of diseases once confined to a tropical ghetto.
Last summer, while ocean scientists recorded the sharpest increase in surface temperatures in history off the West Coast, public health officials were tracking a worrisome epidemic of poisonings caused by a sea-based bacteria known as vibrio parahaemoliticus.
Although the bacteria is always present, it is almost never a major health concern. But in 1997, as ocean surface temperatures rose from one to three degrees, British Columbia suddenly had about 100 Vibrio poisonings, confirms Shaun Peck, deputy public health officer for the provincial government.
Klaus Schallie, the regional shellfish expert for the Canadian food inspection agency, says he's reluctant to tie the outbreak directly to rising water temperatures because toxic algae blooms known as red tides are not uncommon. He wonders whether the vibrio outbreak was connected instead to a sharp decrease in coastal salinity caused by rapidly melting snowpacks in the interior.
"I don't believe it was a single factor like temperature. It's complicated. There are a lot of unknowns. It's really hard to make a generalization," Schallie says. But he agrees that the vibrio outbreak was unprecedented.
The B.C. phenomenon provided an eerie echo of the Atlantic seaboard, where proliferating toxic algae blooms were accompanied by outbreaks of Pfiesteria piscicida, a tiny sea creature that mutates and causes flesh-eating infections. Last summer it proved a major disruption for a $1.5-billion fishing industry.
Donald Anderson, director of the National Office for Marine Biotoxins and Harmful Algae Blooms at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, assessed the problem for the media last month.
"The problem is big and the problem is serious," he said. The organism has killed one billion fish in eastern U.S. waters since 1991.
Increasingly, while mainstream science debates its skeptical fringe over whether global warming is a natural cycle or a man-made phenomenon, public health physicians sweat about the practical risks that rising temperatures already pose for hundreds of millions of people.
A rise in average planetary temperature - even by as little as one or two degrees over the next century - will expose vast populations in temperate regions of Europe, North America and Asia to exotic diseases previously restricted to a narrow tropical zone.
And Andrew Weaver, a prize-winning scientist at the University of Victoria's School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, says world temperature is indisputably on the rise.
Concrete evidence of global warming includes the melting of permafrost across Canada's arctic, the rapid retreat of alpine and arctic glaciers and, perhaps most telling, insurance industry records, which show extreme weather events are more frequent.
The annual inflation-adjusted insured cost of major windstorms, for example, has increased from about $500 million in 1966 to more than $11 billion in 1996, says Jim Harries, policy development manager for the Insurance Bureau of Canada.
The economic implications extend beyond property damage.
In Florida, where public health officials are battling a tenacious regional outbreak of a mosquito-borne virus that can cause fatal brain inflammations, even Orlando's Walt Disney World has been forced to take precautions. Hotel pools, water parks, golf courses, fishing and campfire areas are now closed to tourists during evening hours when the mosquitoes' bite is on.
And Caribbean cruise ships now avoid ports where mosquito- transmitted dengue fever is prevalent, placing the region's $12- billion US tourist industry at risk, warns Paul Epstein, of Harvard Medical School's Centre for Health and the Global Environment.
Malaria and cholera - both associated with rising water temperatures - have returned to Europe with a vengeance on the heels of the hottest summers in recorded history.
Europe had 200,000 malaria cases in 1995. The World Health Organization predicts millions of new sufferers by 2000. The range of malaria mosquitoes already extends as far north as Britain. Meanwhile, in the last four years, the number of registered cholera cases - a disease once thought eradicated - increased ninefold.
North American public health authorities have similar headaches. Malaria outbreaks occurred in New Jersey in 1991 and in New York in 1993. Since 1980, mosquito-borne encephalitis epidemics have occurred in Florida, Mississippi, New Orleans, Texas, Arizona, California and Colorado.
B.C. has had more than 600 malaria cases reported over the last 18 months. While all of these are believed to involve travellers from Asia, mosquitoes capable of transmitting the disease are present in the Lower Mainland.
The absence of a reservoir of malarial infection in the human population prevents local transmission in B.C., but public health officials acknowledge that the possibility is clearly there.
Expansion of range for mosquitoes carrying disease-causing parasites like malaria and deadly viruses like those which cause yellow fever, dengue fever and encephalitis are emerging as a major public health concern worldwide.
And rising water temperature will aid in the spread of cholera - and accelerate a worldwide expansion in the number of what scientists call HABs or harmful algae blooms.
"We have to be thinking about these things," warns Arlene King, an epidemiologist at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver. "One of these days we're going to wake up and say: `It's finally happened. Why didn't we do anything about it?' "
But she says public health authorities are chronically under- resourced, stretched thin from dealing with more immediate outbreaks.
"Public health is not glamorous. It's not sexy like tertiary health care," she says. "It's hard to get people to pay attention to public health issues - particularly long-term ones."
That view is shared by the World Health Organization, which warned in its 1996 report that a "fatal complacency" greets resurgent malaria, cholera, encephalitis and the emergence of 30 new infectious diseases which include the almost always fatal hemmorhagic fever Ebola and North America's lethal hantavirus.
Weaver says skeptics on global warming are either working with data which is profoundly out of date or have expertise in other disciplines and do not fully understand climate change.
He says the most compelling evidence that the planet is warming up comes not from abstract theory but from direct comparisons between historical records of actual change and what mathematical models predict for the same periods.
For example, historical records at Ellensburg, Wash., show an increase in average temperature of one degree and a 20-per-cent increase in average annual precipitation since 1929.
Greater rainfall worries epidemiologists, too. It means more turbidity in drinking water. That means increased viral, bacterial and protozoan load on systems where provincewide there are already 240 boil-water advisories in effect for community water supplies.
Outbreaks of cryptosporidium and toxoplasmosis have affected even large urban water supplies in B.C. in the last few years.
"If you have more rain and flash flooding, you're going to get more flushing," says King. "We don't want more animal and human feces being flushed into our water systems."
Peck says the medical concern approaches consensus. He returned from the annual conference of the American Public Health Association with a sheaf of medical literature expressing worry over long-term health risks from rising temperatures (See information box: Effects of risng temperatures on human health).
Among the major concerns for Canadian epidemiologists:
Potential for increases in the northward range of encephalitis- bearing mosquitoes; the frequency and severity of water-borne infections including hemorrhagic e-coli, typhoid, toxoplasomosis, cryptosporidium and salmonella; increases in the range and incidence of tick-borne infections like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain fever; seasonal epidemics of upper respiratory ailments associated with automobile smog and ground level ozone in the Lower Mainland; expanded range for bats infected with rabies; exploding rodent populations infected with hantavirus; the spread of coastal toxic algae blooms which contaminate shellfish.
"I think we should be concerned," says King. "We should be planning about how to cope. One of the things we have to think about is really beefing up our public health capacity to deal with these issues that I think are invevitable.
"The single biggest vaccination against future problems is to educate as many people as possible."

Abstract: At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, Canada led the way in arguing for a strong climate policy.

It now predicts emissions will be 13 per cent higher in 2000 than they were just seven years ago. While great uncertainty does exist on the details of climate change, the existence of a greenhouse effect is not in dispute, nor is the fact that the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are increasing due mainly to fossil-fuel burning and land clearing. There is a strong scientific consensus that human activities already affect the climate and that continued growth in emissions will only accelerate these changes. It is striking how little attention is paid to the impacts. Indeed, several years ago, at least one poll suggested that winter- weary Canadians liked the idea of global warming. Part of the problem is that little can be said with certainty about specific local and regional impacts of climate change. Nevertheless, there has been a great deal of analysis, in Canada and elsewhere, and these studies paint a disturbing picture of potential changes in temperature, precipitation and the frequency of storms, droughts, forest fires, insect infestations and floods.

Full text: We need more than hot air: Admittedly there is controversy over greenhouse gases and global warming. But public debate cannot afford to ignore them.
At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, Canada led the way in arguing for a strong climate policy. Today, Canada has abandoned its original target of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. It now predicts emissions will be 13 per cent higher in 2000 than they were just seven years ago.
Until recently, Canada resisted the idea of targets and timetables, and will apparently only adopt a target before December's meeting in Kyoto to avoid international embarrassment.
The political reasons for Canada's backpedalling are rooted in the influence of Alberta and the oil industry. However, just as striking as the political foot-dragging is the degree to which the terms of the debate have shifted. Certain taken-for-granted positions have narrowed the debate and prevented important arguments from being taken seriously. The result is a wrong-headed framing of the debate, much public confusion and, most importantly, missed opportunities.
What are these dubious propositions? The first is that the science of climate change is uncertain. Never in history has an environmental issue been so extensively studied nor has there been so elaborate a process of reviewing the science and coming to an international consensus. Yet we continue to hear how uncertain the science is.
While great uncertainty does exist on the details of climate change, the existence of a greenhouse effect is not in dispute, nor is the fact that the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are increasing due mainly to fossil-fuel burning and land clearing. There is a strong scientific consensus that human activities already affect the climate and that continued growth in emissions will only accelerate these changes.
Skeptics exist. Indeed, they should be welcomed. But to pretend that the existence of a very small number of skeptics demonstrates deep scientific uncertainty about the existence of climate change is simply wrong.
The second dubious proposition is that we can ignore the potential impacts of climate change.
It is striking how little attention is paid to the impacts. Indeed, several years ago, at least one poll suggested that winter- weary Canadians liked the idea of global warming. Part of the problem is that little can be said with certainty about specific local and regional impacts of climate change. Nevertheless, there has been a great deal of analysis, in Canada and elsewhere, and these studies paint a disturbing picture of potential changes in temperature, precipitation and the frequency of storms, droughts, forest fires, insect infestations and floods.
All of those would have significant impacts on forestry, agriculture, human health, and communities and economies around the world. The world will not collapse due to global climate change, but it is prudent to undertake measures to reduce the risk of significant damages. It's no accident that the insurance industry is calling for stronger policy measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
The third dubious proposition is that the costs of reducing emissions are too high. This is a canard.
Hundreds of studies have pointed out energy-efficiency measures that would not only reduce emissions, but also cut costs. Our government has simply failed to deliver on these `worth-doing- anyway' measures. Beyond this, we should reduce emissions if the costs are less than the damages we would thereby avoid.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that damage might amount to several percentage points of the gross domestic product in industrialized countries. In addition, we should take into account other benefits such as reduced smog, congestion and the health impacts of local air pollution.
Finally, it would be prudent to spend modest additional amounts, a kind of insurance premium, to avoid the risk of catastrophic impacts for which we can't yet attach costs.
What do these considerations mean for Canada? Aren't we so big, so cold and so dependent on cheap energy, that attempts to reduce emissions would be ruinously expensive, as Alberta Energy Minister Ty Lund suggests?
The accompanying chart shows Canada's carbon dioxide emissions between 1958 and 1994. It illustrates three points.
First, emissions were already nearly stabilized from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. While past forecasts of emissions rose sharply, the actual experience was of very slow growth.
Second, while emissions almost stabilized, GDP continued to grow. So much for ruinous impacts.
Third, it suggests that achieving the stabilization target of the United Nations' framework convention is quite a reasonable goal.
Why then does conventional wisdom suggest the opposite? In some respects a bigger obstacle than the energy industry is the federal energy department's ideological objection to the very idea of an active climate policy.
Part is the neglect of the damage side and part is the fact that, even if Canadian society as a whole benefits, certain sectors, industries and political constituencies will be hurt. Canada's large energy-producing industry and its powerful political lobby oppose any significant measures to reduce fossil fuel emissions.
In all the fear-mongering, what matters is what gets ignored. The tendency to discount the science, ignore the impacts, and focus on the costs prevents us from seeing that the climate-change issue may represent a major opportunity. If the recent rhetoric has any substance at all, then we should consider whether an activist, climate policy might be a significant lever in allowing us to lead in the new information-technology age.
In other words, enacting a policy that would foster the move to environmentally benign, energy-efficient and information-intensive technologies may be a good way to enhance Canadian competitiveness in the global economy. Far from incurring ruinous costs, the countries and companies that move fastest in developing technologies and processes to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, improve environmental quality and create jobs are likely to do rather well in a more crowded and congested future.
Whether these arguments are right or wrong, a public debate that ignores them cannot be productive. In my view, the policy positions resulting from such a truncated discussion are abdications of public responsibility on the part of our governments.
Robinson, director of the Sustainable Development Research Institute at the University of B.C., was principal lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .

Abstract: A tool has been developed in Britain to help investors assess companies' contribution to climate change and their resulting exposure to financial risk. A so-called global warming indicator enables companies to measure their output of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel consumption, whether in making and transporting products or heating their offices. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas associated with global warming. The indicator's sponsors argue that companies least able to curb their emissions could incur financial penalties.

Full text: A tool has been developed in Britain to help investors assess companies' contribution to climate change and their resulting exposure to financial risk.
A so-called global warming indicator enables companies to measure their output of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel consumption, whether in making and transporting products or heating their offices.
The measure has been produced by Imperial College and National Provident Institution , the insurance company. They hope it will become an internationally accepted reporting requirement in company accounts.
Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas associated with global warming. The indicator's sponsors argue that companies least able to curb their emissions could incur financial penalties.
"That companies should produce such an indicator is not simply a matter of corporate responsibility towards a chronic global issue, it is also a matter of providing shareholders with more adequate information about exposure to new costs," the proposal for the scheme says.
"Such costs, arising from taxes and changing market conditions, are likely to arise as counter measures to increased global warming take hold."
Developed countries meet in Kyoto, Japan, next month to negotiate their first legally binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Many governments are expected to step up measures to discourage fossil fuel waste as well as to move away from carbon intensive fuels such as coal and promote renewable sources.
Some experts believe financial markets could become the most potent source of pressure for environmental improvements. Tessa Tennant, head of ethical investment at NPI, said the indicator would be particularly useful for differentiating between companies in the same sector.
Investors' emerging responsiveness to environmental considerations was illustrated on October 21 when shares in RJB Mining , the coal mining company, fell 23 per cent. Investors were reacting to a sell recommendation by Dresdner Kleinwort Benson , which said environmental measures would batter the coal industry in spite of hopes the Labour government would prop it up.
The indicator scheme is being circulated to UK accountants and companies for review.
It is the latest attempt to link companies' financial and environmental performance. Last year, Business in the Environment , a UK non-profit organisation, tried to rank Britain's 100 biggest companies according to their commitment to environmental management. Companies' subsequent efforts to improve their ranking in this year's exercise reveal just how much influence even voluntary benchmarking schemes wield.
Once the indicator has been reviewed by some of its potential users, it will be available for any business to try out, initially on a voluntary basis. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: Part of that will be reselling the Farm Bureau's message to reach urbanites and suburbanites, using farmers and ranchers as spokespeople, [Dennis Stolte] said. Those occupations rank highly in believability and credibility, he said. While agricultural interests did not win all battles it lined up for, Stolte said they did gain ground in agriculture tax issues, such as reducing estate taxes and achieving 100 percent deductions on health insurance for farmers and ranchers. Stolte said measures being contemplated to control their production could include emission controls on methane, controls on feed types, limits on production per acre of some crops and taxes on fossil fuels.

Full text: CHEYENNE -- Agricultural lobbyists gearing up for the second half of the 105th Congress have found that a slate of conservative lawmakers didn't necessarily help their causes in the first half.
"We'll have to work harder. We'll have to work smarter," said Dennis Stolte, American Farm Bureau Federation senior director of Environment and Food Safety.
Part of that will be reselling the Farm Bureau's message to reach urbanites and suburbanites, using farmers and ranchers as spokespeople, Stolte said. Those occupations rank highly in believability and credibility, he said.
While agricultural interests did not win all battles it lined up for, Stolte said they did gain ground in agriculture tax issues, such as reducing estate taxes and achieving 100 percent deductions on health insurance for farmers and ranchers.
In the second half of the session, he said, lobbyists will continue to work in the tax area and will seek a good grazing bill.
Beyond that, Stolte offered up three predictions on the final day of the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation's annual meeting on how the regulatory atmosphere is shaping up:
Environmental and food safety concerns will intensify the pressure for new practices.
The threat of e. coli, being passed through domestic beef and poultry and salmonella and hepatitis being passed through imported fruits and vegetables will likely drive regulatory practices inside farm gates.
Water quality regulations on wetlands, ground water and non- point source pollution will affect grazing practices. What's more, nutrient management, already a buzz word in the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay and along the upper Mississippi River valley, aims to control the overenrichment of watersheds.
Confined animal feeding operations likely will engender a big debate in agriculture circles.
Air quality issues will meet or exceed water quality regulations in their impact on farms and ranches.
Voluntary emission targets have become legally enforceable limits that apply to the 30 industrialized countries of the 160 that signed on to the global climate change treaty in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
Agriculture ranks high on the list of activities that produce greenhouse gases.
Stolte said measures being contemplated to control their production could include emission controls on methane, controls on feed types, limits on production per acre of some crops and taxes on fossil fuels.

Full text: What will take fossil fuel's place?
Saturday, November 15, 1997
UNINTENDED negative consequences of well-meaning policies are the stuff of legends. When a judge protected the forest habitat of the northern spotted owl, his aim was not to drive up the price of lumber on the Chicago Commodities Exchange. Attempts to force households to produce less garbage have frequently resulted in an increase in illegal and uncontrolled dumping.
An agreement in Kyoto on how to deal with fears of man-made climate change would be no different, but one hears very little serious discussion of the foreseeable consequences of a big Green win in Japan. Now might be a good time to start.
After all, the central target of the climate change treaty advocates is the carbons produced when relatively cheap fossil fuels are burned to produce energy. Restrict access to fossil fuels or raise their price and you make the alternatives more attractive. Then too, if dirty fossil fuels like tar sands and coal are to be the latest object of ecological concern, other previously demonized methods of power generation may find themselves rehabilitated. Step forward nuclear energy and hydroelectricity.
Of course unless Kyoto gets really out of hand, it will take quite a while for new nuclear power plants to become truly competitive on a level playing field. In this country we have subsidized the nuclear power industry and its exports, shielded it from its insurance liabilities, and failed to make adequate provisions for decommissioning and spent fuel disposal. Still, we have existing nuclear plants in three provinces (Ontario gets 60 per cent of its electricity from nuclear power). These represent largely sunk costs, and the unfunded decommissioning liabilities already exist.
Much of nuclear's bad reputation comes from incompetent planning that drove up some plants' construction costs, as well as appalling management and safety procedures that can be fixed by competition and a more effective regulatory and insurance regime. They are not inherent in nuclear power. As a power source that produces no greenhouse gas emissions to speak of, every tightening of the fossil fuel screw will make nuclear power from existing and possibly even new plants relatively more feasible.
A bigger winner, though, will be hydro power. It is easy to turn down hydro power contracts for ecological reasons, as New York did with Quebec several years ago, when demand is down and power is cheap and plentiful. Things may well be different with a stiff climate change treaty on the books. Quebec, Newfoundland, British Columbia and Manitoba are sitting on undeveloped hydro resources that, according to those provinces' utilities, can be brought on stream at low prices. And again, hydroelectricity is no culprit on the global warming front.
Of course the destruction of our quaint local electricity monopolies and the rapid emergence of competition and consumer choice will also affect this tableau. The monopolies have suppressed a great deal of generating potential. Industrial co-generation, small-scale hydro and alternative energy projects have all been frustrated. Still, a serious move toward reducing carbon emissions will force us to a more dispassionate analysis of nuclear and hydro power than we have been capable of in recent years.

Full text: The impacts of global warming could be especially acute in Wisconsin, a panel of scientific and public policy experts has warned.
Wisconsin and the other Great Lakes states already experience extreme weather swings. But with average temperatures in the region predicted to increase from 2 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2050, Wisconsin could be particularly vulnerable to increased droughts, floods or heat waves.
And the impact on the state economy may be severe, said John Foley, a professor of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Wisconsin. He recounted how insurance companies nearly went bankrupt trying to pay out damages from the flood of 1993.
"These kinds of events cost us real money," said Foley during a town meeting on global climate change Wednesday at the Monona Terrace Convention Center.
The meeting, which drew an audience of about 125, coincided with next month's conference in Kyoto, Japan, where world leaders will discuss reducing carbon dioxide emissions. CO2 is a by-product of fossil fuel burning and the major contributor to the greenhouse effect, as gases gather in the Earth's upper atmosphere, trapping heat and warming the planet.
But while environmentalists and some scientists have pushed for immediate action to cut emissions, business interests have generally argued that trying to curb energy use will stifle economic growth.
Panel speakers, including former Gov. Tony Earl and Secretary of State Doug La Follette, tangled with the public policy and lifestyle questions of addressing global climate change.
In Madison, the predicted temperature increases will be enough to keep Lake Mendota from freezing over every year by 2050, said UW limnologist John Magnuson.
"We're already seeing lakes in Wisconsin thawing earlier each spring," said Magnuson.
These changes, Magnuson said, will have impacts on fish populations, with increases in warm water fish such as bass or carp and declines in cold water species such as trout.
The milder temperatures could also have dramatic impacts on the state economy. According to a recent EPA report, climate changes could result in a 55 percent decline in forested areas in northern Wisconsin. This would not only hurt the state timber industry, but would also have negative impacts on recreation and tourism.
Agreeing on solutions won't be easy, however, the panelists warned.
Earl, now a partner with Quarles & Brady law firm, observed that it has taken years just to get stakeholders to agree that global warming is occurring.
"If it's been difficult to agree on the science it's going to be far more difficult to agree what to do with policy," he said.
But Earl recounted how state utility companies had initially opposed mandatory reductions in sulfur emissions during the 1980s. Yet the program proved so successful it was eventually incorporated into the federal Clean Air Act.
Dennis Corrigan, a former General Motors scientist now working for Ovonic Battery Co., touted recent advances in cleaner automobiles. He offered tours in a Geo Metro, powered by a new generation nickel metal-hydride battery. The car tops out at 70 mph and can travel over 240 miles on one charge.
While the prototype cost $70,000, Corrigan said the prices will fall as the market increases. He also said improvements in solar and wind power will eventually make rechargeable electric cars truly energy efficient.
Not all of the panelists were so optimistic, however. La Follette said corporations with a stake in the status quo will fight policy changes at every level to protect their economic interests. He referred to efforts to dispute the theory of global warming, despite widespread agreement among scientists.
"The propaganda campaign is working," La Follette said. "The government continues to fiddle while Rome burns, with the fiddles bought and paid for by the people who started the fire."
But addressing global climate issues now could actually help the state's economy, according to a new report from the Consortium for Integrated Resource Planning at the UW.
The study says that an investment of $1.75 billion in more-efficient technologies between 1997 and 2010 would reduce energy and operating expenditures in Wisconsin by $4.44 billion, for a net savings of $2.7 billion.
Investments in energy-efficient technologies -- such as natural gas-fired water heaters or high-efficiency air conditioning systems -- would result in immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions because of reduced energy use, the report says. About 33 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions in Wisconsin come from coal-fired power plants.

Full text: Kyoto's dark secret is taxes
Wednesday, November 12, 1997
THE secret Chrétien mission to endow Canada with a climate change policy and $1-a-litre gasoline sets down in Regina today. There, Environment Minister Christine Stewart and Natural Resources Minister Ralph Goodale will formally attempt to get the provinces to buy into a half-baked Canadian program to control greenhouse gas emissions. How the provinces react to the plan will give Canadians the first real indicator of their country's position entering the global climate change conference in Kyoto Dec. 1.
The Kyoto conference, where Canada is preparing to sign an international agreement to cut energy use and reduce carbon emissions, is less than three weeks away, but still Ottawa has not released any policy or discussion papers. This is a government that will subject a proposal to allow banks to sell insurance policies through their branch networks to scores of task forces, committee reviews and other high-profile public ventilations. On climate change, however, the Chrétien team has yet to produce even a leaked one-page note on the climate change issue or on the economic costs associated with a global campaign to change the world's economy.
We may learn today whether provincial officials have received anything more concrete than the cryptic musings of the Prime Minister, much in the way Canadians learned about the Meech Lake accord. The news will get heaved out for public consumption at staged media briefings, and even then the full scope of the decisions will remain unclear.
In many respects, Canada has become a microcosm of the international negotiation system, a dark impenetrable process controlled by bureaucrats, politicians and assorted non-government organizations. They meet in secret, exchange views, conduct internal debates, grant approvals and reach agreements that have major, even catastrophic, implications -- all without providing the public with any meaningful information.
The Prime Minister calls this closed process of policy making one of "taking stock, consulting with partners across Canada: provincial governments, industrial sectors, NGOs." But why should this consulting and policy formation not be open to all Canadians? As it stands, Ottawa could sign a binding agreement in Kyoto, committing Canadians to massive energy cuts and higher energy taxes and costs, without a Commons debate or parliamentary approval.
In a speech last week, Mr. Chrétien made vague allusions to some of the "guiding principles" his government is using as it prepares for Kyoto. He talked about being "fair to all regions," which may be a coded commitment not to burden Alberta and Saskatchewan with a disproportionate share of the billions of dollars in costs and lost growth that are inevitable under any of the contemplated carbon control programs.
As if to fulfill that commitment, Mr. Chrétien renewed his promise not to impose a "carbon tax." That may keep Alberta and the oil industry happy, but it does nothing for the rest of the country. A carbon tax is a specific tax that would be applied on the production of oil, gas or other fossil fuel. If not a carbon tax, however, some other form of tax will have to be applied. Among the possibilities are new gasoline taxes collected nationally that would be designed to reduce consumption, or elaborate "emissions trading" mechanisms that would also in the final analysis be nothing more than major new taxes.
The auto industry favours new taxes on gasoline, environmentalists support new taxes, and many economists endorse new taxes if they are dolled up as "market mechanisms" such as tradable emissions permits. Market mechanisms, however, are nothing more than regulations and taxes disguised as "price" changes, supposedly to alter economic behavior by mimicking a free market. The result, more often than not, is revenues redistributed to government or somebody selected by government; in other words, a tax.
New taxes are the most logical outcome -- and may well be the real objective -- of any global agreement to control greenhouse gas emissions. Ottawa has claimed it will attempt to stick to a voluntary control program that will allow industry to meet emissions reduction targets on their own, without regulation or taxation -- an unlikely, if not impossible, scenario. If there's agreement in Kyoto, a Kyoto tax is sure to follow.
We may begin to learn more about Ottawa's plan to reduce emissions and raise taxes today, providing provincial environment ministers are willing to share some of the Chrétien government's secret agenda. On the other hand, we may all remain in the dark as Ottawa dispatches negotiators to Kyoto to sign an agreement no Canadian will have had a role in preparing.

War of the world Environment: The smug foot soldiers of the `carbon club' secured victory for big business in the opening battles of the climate talks. But Jeremy Leggett sees seeds of hope for a fightback

Abstract: The ambassador from Samoa spoke from the heart at the close of the latest session of the climate talks in Bonn last week. `Let not the many be sacrificed for the few,' he said. `There would be moral repugnance in that.' But, as usual, such anguished pleas by developing nations for action on global warming were elbowed out by the oil, coal, auto and utility industries. More than 80 of their lobbyists patrolled the corridors, seeking to sabotage the latest attempt to give teeth to the Convention on Climate Change. Watching the carbon club at work, it seemed to me that an entirely new form of conflict has broken out in the world. It has all the deeply-felt divisions of civil war: governments are painfully divided among themselves; business groupings are polarised; some industrial sectors, notably the hydrocarbon sector, are divisively split. But this new form of conflict is also manifestly global. Whole blocs, regions and economy types line up against each other. European Union progressives lock horns with traditional allies in North America and Australasia. Within the G77, the developing world bloc, Opec lines up against fellow members without oil. The Alliance of Small Island States points accusingly at the industrialised world, with its profligate greenhouse gas emissions, and talks of cultural genocide. The diplomatic rituals veil the strongest of feelings. In Bonn, the Americans petulantly walked out of a meeting with the developing countries, igniting fury in their trail.

The diplomatic rituals veil the strongest of feelings. In Bonn, the Americans petulantly walked out of a meeting with the developing countries, igniting fury in their trail.
Adding to the complexity of this drama - soon to reach a vital and perhaps final act at the Kyoto Climate Summit in December - players can, and do, switch sides. Australia once stood in the trenches with the progressives; now its diplomats work with the most merciless of the carbon club's snipers. America's President once gave an Earth Day call to arms; now he allows the carbon club to dictate terms for a retreat.
But through this multi-dimensional battleground, complex as it is geopolitically, two clear sides stand out: those who think global warming is a dire problem that humankind can no longer delay dealing with, and those who don't - or, for some unfathomable reason, don't seem to care.
Should we call this civil/global conflict the carbon war? Would that be an overstatement? After all, though we trust that no actual shots will be fired, the UN tells us the casualties will be measured in hundreds of millions in the decades to come if greenhouse gas emissions are not cut significantly. Indeed, if the action advocates - our Prime Minister among them - are right, the fate of the planet, and a liveable future on it, are ultimately at issue. It is as simple as that. And if there is not yet the whiff of cordite, then the first vapour trails of hatred are in the air at the climate talks .
Like many a war, there can be no winners if hostilities persist. The carbon club members maintain that they are defending business and nation. But, according to the UN's best estimates, the angry tide of climate change's impact catalogue will in time wash over economies, grabbing territory and laying waste with the ferocity of the most efficient invading army. Who can do good business - much less run a stable economy - in a world with its thermostat awry? Take just one of the insurance industry's recent warnings. Munich Re, the largest reinsurer in the world, observes in its latest report that `the possible extent of losses caused by extreme natural catastrophes in one of the world's major metropolises or industrial centres could be so great as to cause the collapse of entire countries' economic systems and could even bring about the collapse of the world's financial markets'.
Of course, the action deniers call such talk - and, indeed, global warming itself - hot air. To them, `caution' means not a global effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but business as usual. They are surprisingly few in number, relative to the action advocates, and their state of innocent or wilful denial is ever more transparent. But they are winning - and most painfully so, at the moment. The smugness of their foot soldiers as they went about their work last week in Bonn was palpable. After the negotiations finally ground to stalemated conclusion, the chief lobbyists for oil and coal could be seen outside the negotiating chamber pumping hands enthusiastically with the Opec diplomats who do the lion's share of their dirty work on the inside.
Is all lost? Will governments now inevitably fail to secure the `legally-binding targets and timetables for significant emissions reductions' which most of them have promised to negotiate by the time of Kyoto? Seeds of hope still drift in the wind. BP has broken ranks with the carbon club, back-tracking on their worst disinformation and announcing that solar energy has a big future in the fight against global warming. The company's head of environmental affairs was a lonely man among his oil industry colleagues last week - but not totally so. Enron, America's biggest gas company, and Daimler Benz no less, addressed a briefing entitled `Yes to Kyoto'.
They don't see problems with emissions reductions, just new business opportunities. And whereas 130 American companies put out a joint newspaper advert in the US a few weeks ago, exhorting President Clinton to do nothing, this week 13 companies took the opposite step, among them Turner Broadcasting, Mitsubishi America, Bechtel, and Nike.
The world may yet down carbon arms and pull something out of the fire. But President Clinton will need to find a spine, and Europe's leaders will need to keep their nerve, trusting Daimler Benz and BP's emerging greenhouse views rather than those of General Motors, Exxon, and all the rest.

Abstract: What are greenhouse gases? Greenhouse gases, including water vapor, carbon dioxide and methane, occur naturally in the atmosphere. Providing an insulating layer, they trap heat energy on earth making it 33 degrees warmer than it would otherwise be. But industrial and other human activities have increased the natural level of greenhouse gases, raising the likelihood of climate change and global warming. What's the major r cause of greenhouse gases? The B.C. Environment Ministry says carbon dioxide accounts for 83per cent of B.C.'s greenhouse emissions, created mostly by the burning of fossil fuels. Transportation is the largest single source of CO2.

What's the major r cause of greenhouse gases? The B.C. Environment Ministry says carbon dioxide accounts for 83per cent of B.C.'s greenhouse emissions, created mostly by the burning of fossil fuels. Transportation is the largest single source of CO2.
Forestry accounts for more than a quarter of the province's greenhouse gases, according to Northwest Environment Watch. This is due to burning and decay of debris left in the forest after it has been logged.
The level of greenhouse gases from human activity is strongly influenced by energy prices and economic activity, the Environment Ministry says. Emissions actually dropped in the early 1980s as a result of relatively high energy prices. Ironically cold weather, like the winter of 1989, can raise emissions along with heating bills.
Why should we care about climate change?
Environment Canada says northern countries like Canada will experience greater warming than those near the equator over the next century.
Scientists internationally have identified a number of potential impacts, the federal department says. These include: reduced fish stocks due to changes in ocean temperatures; rising sea levels causing flooding and erosion in B.C., Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island; an increase in forest fires; regional water shortages; melting permafrost in the Arctic; spreading of malaria and other tropical diseases; an increase in the frequency and intensity of "extreme weather events" ranging from heat waves to tornadoes.
The insurance industry has concluded that human activity is already influencing climate change on a global scale, leading to a recent spate of unusual weather patterns.

Abstract: Global warming devotees have been making alarmist predictions about the rising sea levels they think will follow an increase in the Earth's average temperatures. The horror stories include the flooding of low-lying coastal areas, the disappearance of island nations, the inundation of America by environmental refugees, and an exponential explosion in insurance claims. Activists apparently don't realize that the much-ballyhooed climate models that predict global warming cannot make any quantitative predictions at all about sea levels. Nevertheless, climate specialists have constructed a corrected "global" sea-level record; it shows that sea levels have been rising at the rate of about seven inches per century. Is this rise connected to climate? Not likely. The best estimates based on geologic data indicate that this has been going on for several centuries -- a period in which the global climate has fluctuated significantly. Rather, the current thinking is that the steady rise in sea levels is connected to slow tectonic changes in the shape of the ocean basin -- which human beings, of course, can do nothing about. Calculations of any climate effect on sea levels must take account of this more or less steady rise.

Full text: Global warming devotees have been making alarmist predictions about the rising sea levels they think will follow an increase in the Earth's average temperatures. The horror stories include the flooding of low-lying coastal areas, the disappearance of island nations, the inundation of America by environmental refugees, and an exponential explosion in insurance claims. Activists apparently don't realize that the much-ballyhooed climate models that predict global warming cannot make any quantitative predictions at all about sea levels.
They also don't realize that informed speculation about rising sea levels has been steadily falling. Initial estimates by the Environmental Protection Agency projected that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide would cause sea levels to rise by between 80 and 120 inches. By 1990 these estimates had been reduced by 75%. In 1996 a United Nations science advisory panel predicted a rise of only 15 to 22 inches by 2100 -- still based on shaky assumptions.
Even these much smaller estimates are cause for skepticism, because changes in sea level are notoriously difficult to measure, and reliable information is hard to come by. All historical data are based on tide gauges, mainly on the shorelines of Northern Europe and North America. Long-term sea level trends must be extracted after adjusting for waves, storm surges and tidal variations. Scientists must also contend with the fact that the land surface may be rising or falling. Some land surfaces, in Scandinavia for example, are rebounding after being compressed by the weight of glaciers. Other land areas are subsiding, as petroleum or ground water is pumped out.
Nevertheless, climate specialists have constructed a corrected "global" sea-level record; it shows that sea levels have been rising at the rate of about seven inches per century. Is this rise connected to climate? Not likely. The best estimates based on geologic data indicate that this has been going on for several centuries -- a period in which the global climate has fluctuated significantly. Rather, the current thinking is that the steady rise in sea levels is connected to slow tectonic changes in the shape of the ocean basin -- which human beings, of course, can do nothing about. Calculations of any climate effect on sea levels must take account of this more or less steady rise.
The next question is how global warming, if it occurs, would affect sea levels. On the one hand, a warmer climate would melt mountain glaciers and cause a thermal expansion of ocean water, accelerating sea levels' rise. But on the other hand, more water would evaporate from the surface of warmer oceans, leading to more rainfall, and -- over Greenland and the Antarctic -- to greater accumulation of snow and ice. This process essentially thickens the polar ice caps, thus lowering sea levels.
The problem has been to find whether the sea levels' rising or lowering would have a greater impact. This is a question that cannot be answered by theory, or by computer models. To produce an accurate conclusion, we have to examine data. Fortunately, we do have data from a relatively rapid global warming that occurred between about 1900 and 1940, as the climate recovered from a cool period called the Little Ice Age. Neither the Little Ice Age nor the warming that followed are ascribed to human influences; many scientists believe they were caused by subtle changes in the sun's radiation.
In any case, data from the warming of 1900-1940 shows a drop in sea levels, while the subsequent cooler period shows a sea-level rise. This effect is even more pronounced in comparisons of sea-level changes with sea-surface temperatures in the tropics, where most of the oceans' evaporation occurs.
These findings support the hypothesis that ice accumulation in the polar regions may have a greater impact on sea levels than do the melting of glaciers and the thermal expansion of ocean water. Support for this view also comes from concurrent but as yet incomplete measurements of ice accumulation at certain locations in Greenland and the Antarctic.
Contrary to activists' claims, what's clear is that global warming -- if it takes place -- would slow any rise in sea levels. Although more study is needed, this striking result should at least give pause to the Association of Small Island States and other groups that are pressing industrialized nations to adopt drastic reductions in fossil fuel use in order to avoid the global warming "catastrophe" so dear to the environmentalist lobby.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In the very room where Meriwether Lewis and Thomas Jefferson plotted the cross-country search for a Northwest Passage, President Clinton played host Monday night at a White House reception and viewing of Ken Burns' latest documentary, "Lewis & Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery."
Notable guests at the White House reception were actors Matthew Broderick and Adam Arkin, whose voices were featured in the public television production, along with Burns, Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va.; actress Sarah Jessica Parker and historian Stephen Ambrose.
Clinton called the members of the 1804-1806 Lewis and Clark expedition the forebears of those who created the international space station and scientists studying the mysteries of human genetics and researching global climate change.
The president also noted the approaching millennium, saying the United States will welcome the next century "by highlighting American creativity and innovation and our insatiable desire to explore, as we are doing here tonight."
On a day when the shelving of the "fast track" trade bill weighed heavy on his administration, Clinton paid special homage to the cooperation Burns' film portrayed.
"In this town especially, we could all stand to remember that we could all be a little more noble, a little more full of energy, a little more charitable, a little more humble," he said.
The film, shown in a condensed version at the White House event, spanned the Lewis and Clark expedition's nearly 3-year voyage up the Missouri River and across the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, through territory that was previously uncharted.
Ex-actress's life not so wonderful
Karolyn Grimes has had a fairly miserable life since playing Jimmy Stewart's daughter in "It's a Wonderful Life," wherein she delivered the sweet sentiment: "Every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings."
At a weekend appearance in Omaha, Neb., she said her mom died when she was 14, her dad was killed a year later in a car crash, her first husband died in a hunting accident and her second of cancer.
Now living in Kansas, Grimes, 57, added: "In Hollywood, if they can't use you . . . they don't even know you. You've been this little prince or princess all these years, and suddenly you're nothing." But, she noted, she still believes in angels because "I was lifted from the Hollywood scene."
A story Coppola couldn't refuse
A little more than two years ago, Francis Ford Coppola walked into an airport newsstand to find some books to read on a flight to Paris. "I had never read a John Grisham book, and when I saw `The Rainmaker' on the stand, which was the No. 1 best seller, I decided to buy it," Coppola said.
His intention was to take notes as he read the novel, "to learn, to see what appealed to a modern audience." Instead, he became entranced with the book, about a young, idealistic lawyer pitted against an evil insurance company that fails to pay up on the policies it writes to the poor.
"I became a sucker for Grisham just like everyone else," Coppola said. "I couldn't put it down." What fascinated him, he explained, was that the book dealt with a world that rarely had been touched by Hollywood - the seedy side of the law business and corruption in the insurance industry. Coppola also found the young lawyer in the book an almost perfect hero. "He was like a chivalrous knight, sort of pure, helping damsels in distress," he said.
By the time he landed in Paris, Coppola had made up his mind to adapt the book and direct the film. He saw the story as vaguely similar to "The Godfather." "It had the same evocative nature of getting into the story and settings, it was popular fiction and, in both books, there was this underlying sense that if an injustice is done to you, there's somebody you can go to."
The film, opening Nov. 21, has a cast that includes Matt DAamon as the young lawyer, Claire Danes and Jon Voight.
Food book editor digests misspelling
Senior editor Maria Guarnaschelli, who took 3-1/2 years to get the revision of "Joy of Cooking" right, misspelled a contributor's name two of the three times she's mentioned.
"She's my dearest friend," the editor said of Lynne Rossetto Kasper, whose book, "The Splendid Table," Guarnaschelli edited. "I'm going to call her myself (to apologize). But why does that matter at this point?" Bake her an upside-down cake
Former governor pens political tale
Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld might have a new career outside politics.
Weld has written a political thriller set in Boston and has signed a contract with Simon & Schuster, a source told The Boston Globe.
Weld's yarn, reportedly titled "Mackerel by Moonlight," centers on a candidate for district attorney in Boston.
Weld, 52, began the novel in January. He completed the book in March and sold it in August, shortly after resigning as governor.
Weld joins several other political figures who have written suspense novels, including former Sen. Gary Hart and Defense Secretary William Cohen. News Lite is compiled by Karen Duffy from Daily News staff and wire reports

Full text: Senior Environment Canada scientist Gordon McBean, one of the nation's leading experts on global warming, readily concedes what he doesn't know about the phenomenon.
In an appearance before one of three parliamentary committees now studying climate change, McBean recently said scientists can provide politicians only with the facts as they know them.
Scientists cannot predict how much the planet will warm over the coming century or what will happen to regional ecosystems. The Earth's climate is simply too complex.
But what is known, he said, is this: "The scientific community is very confident the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations do exist and we're very confident it's the result of human activities."
McBean was a member of the United Nations panel of 2,000 climate scientists who confirmed the same, seemingly modest facts, in 1995. "The balance of evidence suggests there is a discernible human influence on global climate," concluded the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Most Canadians are coming to understand the significance of that finding, which has led the world to the brink of a new global-warming treaty.
Canada will join 165 nations in Kyoto, Japan, next month to finalize a treaty that sets binding emission targets for carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane. The gases are believed to be the main culprits in a 0.5 C warming of the planet over the past 100 years.
The treaty holds important implications for the Canadian economy since it will force the country to reduce its rate of energy consumption, now among the highest in the world.
Achieving that goal could raise the price of gasoline, throw many in the coal industry out of work and consume some part of Finance Minister Paul Martin's long-awaited fiscal dividend.
The oil, coal and auto industries -- heavy energy consumers -- have led an aggressive challenge to the IPCC findings. Their chief strategy has been to highlight dissenting voices in the scientific community.
Most environmental scientists, however, are convinced that global warming is a real and present danger. For evidence, they point to a pronounced warming trend over the past 40 years and the fact that the 10 warmest years since 1861 (when detailed record-keeping began) have occurred since 1980. The warmest year on record is 1995.
Even some industry leaders say prudence alone should make world leaders address the potential of global warming.
The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers argues that, while the science is not rock solid, "taking steps that make sense now is a lot like buying insurance."
Meanwhile, John Browne, chair of British Petroleum, has said it would be "unwise and potentially dangerous" to ignore the threat. The time to act, he said, "is not when the link between greenhouse gases and climate change is conclusively proven, but when the possibility cannot be discounted."
Prime Minister Jean Chretien has poured scorn on those who dismiss the science of climate change, comparing them to tobacco officials who produced scientists to refute the link between smoking and lung cancer.
"Those arguments are not credible and they're not not responsible," he told an Ottawa audience.
Moreover, the provocative question is not whether global warming exists, but whether enough is known about the phenomenon to take action to stem greenhouse emissions. Is it necessary to make fundamental changes now or can they safely be delayed until climate models are more finely tuned?
Environmental scientists have made predictions about the future effects of global warming based on supercomputer models of the Earth's climate. Those models suggest that as carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere increase, global temperatures rise. The models do not agree about how much the Earth will warm. Predictions range from 1.5 to 4.5 C by 2100.
Although that increase may not seem dramatic, a temperature drop of 5 C plunged the world into an Ice Age.
The most likely scenario, according to the UN panel, is that the Earth will warm 2.5 C by 2100, bringing the planet into a temperature range not seen for millions of years. Computer models suggest that kind of warming will be accompanied by a series of dangerous climactic events: floods, droughts, rising seas and violent storms.
Indeed, when world leaders convene in Kyoto Dec. 1, they'll be coming up with a risk management strategy for the planet.
So far, there's little political agreement about what kind of danger the world faces.
The Europeans, for example, believe the situation is dire. They've proposed reduction targets -- 15 per cent over 1990 levels by the year 2010 -- that reflect their concern.
Canada and the United States are among the nations who have adopted a go-slow approach. They want to curb emissions without damaging their economies and have proposed that greenhouse gas levels be stabilized by 2010 to 2012. For Canada, that would represent a 13-per-cent reduction from current levels because the country's emissions have increased substantially since 1990.
Computer climate models now simulate what the world will be like with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The models suggest that surface temperatures will rise and increase evaporation from oceans, lakes and rivers. Since warm air can hold more moisture, it will make more water available to developing storms. It explains why the world will see drought in some areas and more violent, heavy storms in others.
The same models predict other potential dangers. Oceans are expected to rise as water molecules warm and expand and as polar ice melts. Coastal areas could be inundated, low- lying islands swamped.
Climactic zones could shift north with rising temperatures and there's a chance the ecosystems will move faster than animals and plants are able to adjust. Agriculture could be devastated, particularly in the world's hottest and poorest countries, while growing conditions may well improve in such places as Canada.
Climate scientists are growing increasingly confident in their models as their preliminary forecasts prove correct.
Still, scientists such as McBean concede more work needs to be done to fill in the knowledge gaps: how clouds affect warming levels, how oceans redistribute heat, how melting ice-cover will affect the surface temperature of the Earth.
"There is a possibility that there will be no climate change," he says.

Abstract: Global-warming devotees have been making alarmist predictions about the rising sea levels they think will follow an increase in the earth's average temperatures. The horror stories include the flooding of low-lying coastal areas, the disappearance of island nations, the inundation of America by environmental refugees, and an exponential explosion in insurance claims. Activists apparently don't realize that the much-ballyhooed climate models that predict global warming cannot make any quantitative predictions at all about sea levels. Nevertheless, climate specialists have constructed a corrected "global" sea-level record; it shows that sea levels have been rising at the rate of about seven inches per century. Is this rise connected to climate? Not likely. The best estimates based on geologic data indicate that this has been going on for several centuries -- a period in which the global climate has fluctuated significantly. Rather, the current thinking is that the steady rise in sea levels is connected to slow tectonic changes in the shape of the ocean basin -- which human beings, of course, can do nothing about. Calculations of any climate effect on sea levels must take account of this more or less steady rise.

Long-term sea level trends must be extracted after adjusting for waves, storm surges and tidal variations. Scientists must also contend with the fact that the land surface may be rising or falling. Some land surfaces, in Scandinavia for example, are rebounding after being compressed by the weight of glaciers. Other land areas are subsiding, as petroleum or ground water is pumped out.
Nevertheless, climate specialists have constructed a corrected "global" sea-level record; it shows that sea levels have been rising at the rate of about seven inches per century. Is this rise connected to climate? Not likely. The best estimates based on geologic data indicate that this has been going on for several centuries -- a period in which the global climate has fluctuated significantly. Rather, the current thinking is that the steady rise in sea levels is connected to slow tectonic changes in the shape of the ocean basin -- which human beings, of course, can do nothing about. Calculations of any climate effect on sea levels must take account of this more or less steady rise.
The next question is how global warming, if it occurs, would affect sea levels. On the one hand, a warmer climate would melt mountain glaciers and cause a thermal expansion of ocean water, accelerating sea levels' rise. But on the other hand, more water would evaporate from the surface of warmer oceans, leading to more rainfall, and -- over Greenland and the Antarctic -- to greater accumulation of snow and ice. This process essentially thickens the polar ice caps, thus lowering sea levels.
The problem has been to find whether the sea levels' rising or lowering would have a greater impact. This is a question that cannot be answered by theory, or by computer models. To produce an accurate conclusion, we have to examine data. Fortunately, we do have data from a relatively rapid global warming that occurred between about 1900 and 1940, as the climate recovered from a cool period called the Little Ice Age. Neither the Little Ice Age nor the warming that followed are ascribed to human influences; many scientists believe they were caused by subtle changes in the sun's radiation.
In any case, data from the warming of 1900-1940 show a drop in sea levels, while the subsequent cooler period shows a sea-level rise. This effect is even more pronounced in comparisons of sea-level changes with sea-surface temperatures in the tropics, where most of the oceans' evaporation occurs.
These findings support the hypothesis that ice accumulation in the polar regions may have a greater impact on sea levels than do the melting of glaciers and the thermal expansion of ocean water. Support for this view also comes from concurrent but as yet incomplete measurements of ice accumulation at certain locations in Greenland and the Antarctic.
Contrary to activists' claims, what's clear is that global warming -- if it takes place -- would slow any rise in sea levels. Although more study is needed, this striking result should at least give pause to the Association of Small Island States and other groups that are pressing industrialized nations to adopt drastic reductions in fossil fuel use in order to avoid the global warming "catastrophe" so dear to the environmentalist lobby.

Abstract: A pair of international trade conferences drew intense interest Thursday in Atlanta, the eve of a House vote on President Clinton's request for powers that would speed new free trade agreements. Two protesters disrupted one of the conferences by unfurling a banner and shouting their opposition to the "fast track" negotiating proposal. More than 500 people attended a conference on infrastructure opportunities in South America held at the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel. The conference was sponsored by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency to help U.S. companies assess investment opportunities in the hemisphere. The attendance was twice what organizers expected. Businesses from about 25 states were represented.

A pair of international trade conferences drew intense interest Thursday in Atlanta, the eve of a House vote on President Clinton's request for powers that would speed new free trade agreements.
Two protesters disrupted one of the conferences by unfurling a banner and shouting their opposition to the "fast track" negotiating proposal.
More than 500 people attended a conference on infrastructure opportunities in South America held at the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel. The conference was sponsored by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency to help U.S. companies assess investment opportunities in the hemisphere. The attendance was twice what organizers expected. Businesses from about 25 states were represented.
"People are figuring out that if you want to grow your business and you don't look overseas, that you're not going to grow your business," said Ned Cabot, a spokesman for the federal agency.
The two protesters were escorted peacefully out of the Westin by security personnel after unfurling from a balcony a banner that said "Don't Fast Track the Destruction of the Amazon and Our Climate."
Atossa Soltani said she and another woman represent a group called Amazon Watch and had traveled from Los Angeles to register their views. She said the 125 major projects worth an estimated $200 billion being discussed at the three-day conference that wraps up today would "exacerbate climate change."
A separate conference intended to foster ties between Georgia businesses and Africa was held simultaneously at the Sheraton Four Points Hotel. That conference was organized by Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) and a Washington-based nonprofit group, Corporate Council on Africa.
"It is clear that with the convening of two major conferences on international business taking place here today that Atlanta is truly a gateway for America's international commerce," said George Munos, president of the Overseas Private Investment Corp., who addressed both groups.
Munos, whose federal agency offers "risk insurance" to U.S. firms that invest in emerging economies, spoke up for the fast track proposal that would be used to negotiate new free trade agreements in the hemisphere. "This is a very important moment in time," he said.
The Africa conference drew about 200 businesspeople, most of them from McKinney's 4th Congressional District. "Africa is hot right now," the lawmaker said. "The new democracies of the continent need to ride this curve for as long as possible. It also means profits over here, so it's a win-win situation for all concerned."
Munos also announced plans for a new $150 million U.S. fund that will make investments in African companies.
At a separate luncheon held at the law offices of King & Spalding, Diego Ramiro Guelar, the Argentine ambassador to the United States, called the legislation essential to negotiating a Free Trade of the Americas Agreement that would cover the entire hemisphere.
"If there is no fast track, this negotiation is unfortunately finished before it begins," he said.

Chretien rules out carbon tax: Confirms Liberal Party's stand on greenhouse gases: [Final Edition]

Abstract: Prime Minister Jean Chretien says there'll be no carbon tax imposed in Canada to combat greenhouse gas emissions, confirming what other cabinet ministers have been guardedly saying for weeks. Since returning from a meeting of the Commonwealth last week, Chretien has been making commitments to place tighter controls on carbon dioxide emissions, the most important of the greenhouse gases. The emissions are created when fossil fuels are burned. Chretien also echoed what many environmentalists have said to deflect criticism of greenhouse gas controls -- that a reduction might actually stimulate the economy in other areas.

Full text: Prime Minister Jean Chretien says there'll be no carbon tax imposed in Canada to combat greenhouse gas emissions, confirming what other cabinet ministers have been guardedly saying for weeks.
Chretien told a $325-a-plate Liberal fundraiser last night: "Let our opponents talk about taxes and other horror stories. But I have news for them, Halloween is over.
"We have already said that there will be no carbon tax, and I repeat it tonight.
"Let's talk about what we can do to pass on a healthy planet to our children and grandchildren."
Chretien's speech at the annual Maple Leaf dinner was as green as it gets, as he advocated a strong commitment to the environment at the pivotal climate conference to be held one month from now in Kyoto, Japan.
But he hinted that the government may decide to stagger a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions over a longer time frame. The United States has pledged it will stabilize its emissions at 1990 levels by 2008 to 2012.
MAKING COMMITMENTS
"We are not interested in penalizing or singling out one region or one industry, and that has never been the approach of this government," Chretien said.
"We want to have reasonable targets step by step. I know it will lead some to criticize us for being too soft, but it's what critics said about our deficit targets and we don't hear them say that anymore."
Since returning from a meeting of the Commonwealth last week, Chretien has been making commitments to place tighter controls on carbon dioxide emissions, the most important of the greenhouse gases. The emissions are created when fossil fuels are burned.
Both Energy Minister Ralph Goodale and his predecessor Anne McClellan, now justice minister, have already said a carbon tax is not an option for the Canadian government but until now Chretien has not said the same.
The Reform party has been pressing the Liberal government on the prospect of higher energy taxes, which Reform says will harm the oil industry and throw the economy into a tailspin.
Chretien didn't hesitate to take shots at the opposition.
"Some people refuse to accept the scientific evidence of global warming; they say the scientific proof is not conclusive," he said. "Do you remember how the tobacco companies claimed there was no proof that smoking caused lung cancer?"
Chretien also echoed what many environmentalists have said to deflect criticism of greenhouse gas controls -- that a reduction might actually stimulate the economy in other areas.
"We have the occasion to change this global consensus into a golden opportunity, that far from costing jobs in Canada will create more and more of them," he said.
"Look at companies like Ballard in Vancouver. They are the world leading edge company in electric buses and automobiles . . . look at the growing use of green technologies that are making new buildings much more energy efficient.
"These are the areas we should focus on."
Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere have been rising ever since the Industrial Revolution.
Such gases are transparent to incoming radiation from the sun but are opaque to this radiation when it bounces back from Earth at a shorter wavelength. The result is rising heat trapped in the atmosphere.
Reform leader Preston Manning said yesterday he questions that assessment. "I'm still not convinced how serious the contribution is to global warming."
Chretien's statement came as the federal government moves to bring together the nation's leading environmental scientists to discuss the warming of Canada at a climate change symposium.
The symposium, scheduled for Nov. 24 to 26 in Toronto, will be held one week before federal officials go to Kyoto, Japan, to take part in final negotiations on a global warming treaty.
A series of research volumes will be presented at the symposium, including the much anticipated Canada Country Study that assesses the impact of global warming on the nation's ecosystems and its major economic sectors: agriculture, energy, fisheries, forestry, insurance, transport, recreation and tourism.
The symposium is part of an 11th-hour federal information campaign designed to make the slow march of global warming real to Canadians.
Canada remains the only major economic power that has yet to endorse a specific reduction target in advance of the Kyoto conference.

Abstract: The geological record shows that there is a correlation between increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and rises in global temperature; there is no reason to believe that this relationship no longer holds true. For the past 200 years (since the start of the Industrial Revolution), anthropogenic activities account for the greatest increase in the atmospheric budget of carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide-equivalent gases.

Full text: Blinkered perspective on global warming
Saturday, November 1, 1997
Halifax -- The Globe and Mail's continued stand against action on anthropogenic climate change is both ill-founded and misleading.
The geological record shows that there is a correlation between increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and rises in global temperature; there is no reason to believe that this relationship no longer holds true. For the past 200 years (since the start of the Industrial Revolution), anthropogenic activities account for the greatest increase in the atmospheric budget of carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide-equivalent gases.
At present, selected satellite data may appear to suggest that certain parts of the atmosphere that should be warming are not; however, other data are less controversial. Polar-orbiting meteorological satellite images of high latitudes (well into the Arctic circle) show an increase in photosynthesis earlier in the spring; this could be due to increasing temperatures, increasing levels of carbon dioxide, or both.
Computer general circulation models (GCMs) cannot be dismissed as "educated guesswork." It was recently announced that a marked warming has been detected in Alaska, with an average increase of one degree per decade over the past 30 years; these temperature rises were predicted by existing GCMs.
There is a growing body of circumstantial evidence suggesting that increased levels of greenhouse gases are affecting the planet; for example, the unexpected strength of El Nino and the depletion of Arctic ozone. Climate change may not yet be an established fact, but insurance companies are not taking chances.

Abstract: From one side of his hilltop water treatment works Henry Edmunds can see the spire of Salisbury Cathedral, from the other, the busy A303 London to Exeter road as it crosses Salisbury Plain. From the same vantage point he can also just about see the area bounding the 800 households served by Britain's smallest water company. Edmunds, 47, is managing director and principal shareholder of that enterprise, the Cholderton and District Water Company. The company dates from 1904, when it was set up under an Act of Parliament by Henry Stephens, the philanthropic MP, owner of Stephens Inks and great-grandfather of Henry Edmunds.

Full text: From one side of his hilltop water treatment works Henry Edmunds can see the spire of Salisbury Cathedral, from the other, the busy A303 London to Exeter road as it crosses Salisbury Plain. From the same vantage point he can also just about see the area bounding the 800 households served by Britain's smallest water company.
Edmunds, 47, is managing director and principal shareholder of that enterprise, the Cholderton and District Water Company.
The company dates from 1904, when it was set up under an Act of Parliament by Henry Stephens, the philanthropic MP, owner of Stephens Inks and great-grandfather of Henry Edmunds.
Edmunds took over the reins when his father died in 1975. He runs the business, together with the remainder of the 2,500-acre estate, in much the same way as did his father and grandfather.
During the past 15 turb-ulent years of privatisation, takeovers and amalgamations in the UK water supply industry, Cholderton and District Water Company has resisted all attempts to persuade it to be part of a larger organisation. It still supplies drinking water to fewer than 3,000 people.
Despite the odd emergency, which can mean heavy outlays on buying in labour and equipment, the annual figures have been remarkably even over the past few years, with turnover at around £110,000 and profits after tax of about £10,000.
There has been one exception to this. In 1994, 50 new houses were built in Shipton Bellinger, one of the two villages supplied by the company. The infrastructure and basic connection charges, £540 for each house, helped turnover rise to £115,000 in 1995 and net profits to £28,000.
For the year just ended, Edmunds is expecting a turnover of £120,000, with a net profit of £17,500.
"It is a satisfactory, if unexciting, performance for a company with only two full-time employees - a secretary and an engineer," Edmunds says. "But what is important is that the water company is a great asset to the Cholderton estate. I have 600 cattle and 450 breeding ewes, all of which need a great deal of water.
"I also find it satisfying that local people seem content with the service and the Drinking Water Inspectorate has branded our water 'excellent', with 100 per cent compliance with European standards. In 1996, we were the only UK water company to achieve this."
Nevertheless, despite the lack of a corporate identity, share options, wrangles over leakage rates and fat-cat salaries, and the managing director's car being a battered Land Rover, the company still has its exciting moments. Usually these are attributable to what the insurance industry would call "acts of God", and the climate change that Edmunds is convinced is upon us.
This year, for the first time, Cholderton and District Water Company had to use the standby supply that Edmunds and a team drawn from his 10-strong farm labour force installed over four years at a cost of £50,000.
"It is the first time we have used the second borehole in the six years since it was completed," says Edmunds. "I had decided to install a standby borehole after the very dry summer of 1976. We are a statutory water company - required by Act of Parliament to supply the area we cover - and I knew from our records that by the late 1980s the water table in the chalk under our main borehole had fallen by 70ft.
"This year, the borehole could not maintain the flow rate needed to fill our reservoir so we used water from the standby source to fill it.
"Although we had a reas-onable amount of summer rainfall this year, which reduced demand for mains water for garden watering, summer rainfall is absolutely useless from the point of view of aquifer recharge. Our ground water levels here have dropped even more this year. The water is 225ft down when pumped - a level that goes back to the very dry year of 1976.
"What we really need for aquifer recharge is lots of heavy winter rainfall. But there is lots of water in our new aquifer. I am optimistic that it will meet all our future needs."
Edmunds has just completed installing a £6,000 monitoring system that keeps a check on all the company's main supply pipes. It has shown him what he suspected had been the case for several years: that the company's leakage rate is well under 10 per cent.
"I am fairly sure it is nearer 5 per cent - pretty good, considering some of the large companies admit to rates nearer 40 per cent," he says.
When there is a leak it is a case of all hands to the plough - or rather off the plough. In June this year, a customer rang early one morning to report that he could hear the sound of rushing water beneath the roadside verge outside his house.
"When we lifted a nearby inspection cover we found a swirling torrent," says Edmunds. "To get at the burst pipe, which was in the ground below the inspection pit, we had to dig a huge hole so we could get below the level of the break in order to effect the repair.
"To do this we had to cut off the supply to the village and call in labour from the farm. When this happens the usual result is the managing director up to his knees in water with a spade in his hand, and this was no exception. However. the leak was repaired before lunch."
Edmunds' main accounting maxim is simple: stay in the black at all times. "We have had no lossmaking years, but I should not be averse to borrowing if I had to put in a treatment plant to remove organic chemicals if it proved necessary," he says.
Despite his bucolic surroundings and air of gentlemanly benevolence, Ed- munds sometimes has a fight on his hands when he insists on his legal right to install water meters in commercial premises. "I have never had to go to court yet. Sometimes a business might ring up Ofwat , the regulator, to gain confirmation that I am within my rights to insist on a meter, but that it is as far as it has gone so far," he says.
Neither is Edmunds averse to playing the role of village squire when it comes to collecting his dues. Every few days, the secretary Jennie Blackburn spends several hours driving round the homes of the elderly and those on income support collecting weekly payments.
"It's not the most efficient use of her time, but it helps keep the cash flowing in," Edmunds says. "Besides, the elderly people are often lonely and enjoy a visit."

The Making of a Myth --- What Warming?

Abstract: Brussels -- So President Clinton has issued his proposals to combat the supposed threat of global warming. Although they have been criticized by environmentalists and European officials for not going "far enough," they signal his acceptance of the theory that human activity (primarily emissions from the burning of fossil fuels) is adding significantly to the Earth's natural greenhouse effect, that this portends a significant warming of the global climate, and that it is worth diverting a significant amount of society's resources in an attempt to stave off that threat. Of course, in Mr. Clinton's mind, these propositions are no longer worth examining, since "the vast majority of the world's climate scientists have concluded" that man-made global warming is underway. While it may not appear to be "a clear and present danger," said Mr. Clinton, it is real and "far more subtle." It is true that between 1890 and 1990 land-based measurements, which unfortunately exclude much of the Earth's surface, show a warming of about 0.45 degrees Celsius. Trouble is (for the global warming theorists anyway) that 0.34 degrees of this increase occurred before 1940, while most man-made greenhouse gas emissions have occurred since then. In fact, during a period of high emissions, between 1940 and 1975, the average global temperature measurements dropped. And since then, data are inconclusive. Land-based measurements show a slight warming, but are dubious because they may be biased upward by the urban "heat island" effect. (It is well known that cities may be several degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside.) Meanwhile, satellite measurements starting in 1979, which are subject to no such bias and which cover a much greater portion of the Earth, show no warming at all.

Full text: Brussels -- So President Clinton has issued his proposals to combat the supposed threat of global warming. Although they have been criticized by environmentalists and European officials for not going "far enough," they signal his acceptance of the theory that human activity (primarily emissions from the burning of fossil fuels) is adding significantly to the Earth's natural greenhouse effect, that this portends a significant warming of the global climate, and that it is worth diverting a significant amount of society's resources in an attempt to stave off that threat.
Of course, in Mr. Clinton's mind, these propositions are no longer worth examining, since "the vast majority of the world's climate scientists have concluded" that man-made global warming is underway. While it may not appear to be "a clear and present danger," said Mr. Clinton, it is real and "far more subtle."
So subtle, apparently, that it can't be detected. Actual temperature measurements offer no consistent support for the claim that the Earth is getting warmer, and the link between temperature and the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is more tenuous still.
It is true that between 1890 and 1990 land-based measurements, which unfortunately exclude much of the Earth's surface, show a warming of about 0.45 degrees Celsius. Trouble is (for the global warming theorists anyway) that 0.34 degrees of this increase occurred before 1940, while most man-made greenhouse gas emissions have occurred since then. In fact, during a period of high emissions, between 1940 and 1975, the average global temperature measurements dropped. And since then, data are inconclusive. Land-based measurements show a slight warming, but are dubious because they may be biased upward by the urban "heat island" effect. (It is well known that cities may be several degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside.) Meanwhile, satellite measurements starting in 1979, which are subject to no such bias and which cover a much greater portion of the Earth, show no warming at all.
Why then do global warming theorists enjoy such popular support, and why are the nations of the world planning to sign a treaty in Kyoto, Japan, this December committing themselves to drastic and painful limitations on the use of fossil fuels? Partly because "carbon taxes" promise a new source of revenue, and partly because they actually have been fooled by a highly successful campaign that plays on public ignorance, and tries to disguise its political agenda in the name of science.
Environmentalist groups like Greenpeace, of course, are well-known proponents of the global warming theory. But they have a history of economy with the facts. More insidious are groups that claim to represent the consensus of informed scientific opinion, and which disguise their inconclusive findings in vague but ominous language. That, unfortunately, seems to have been the fate of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a U.N.-sponsored body whose 1996 report on climate change was widely described as the "smoking gun" linking man-made greenhouse gases to global warming. Actually, the report said no such thing, but the misleading wording of its Policymakers' Summary (the only part of the report most readers will ever see) might give that impression.
In an important article that appeared on this page last year, Frederick Seitz, former president of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, declared that during more than 60 years of professional life he had "never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer review process than the events that led to this IPCC report." His charge was not that the majority of the scientists who had contributed to the report had not done good work. Rather, following acceptance of the final draft by members of the IPCC, at least 15 sections of Chapter 8, weighing evidence for and against human influence on the climate, were changed. A number of passages emphasizing uncertainty were absent from the published version. The excised material, he pointed out, includes the declaration that "Not one of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed {climate} changes to the specific cause of increases in greenhouse gases."
Mr. Seitz's article spawned a fierce debate on the Journal's letters page, including multiple responses from Benjamin D. Santer, convening lead author of Chapter 8. He took responsibility for the changes and claimed that it was normal for drafts to be altered in response to comments from contributors. But he did not adequately explain why this had not been done before the paper's final approval, and even offered the strange (for a debate about scientific method) argument that his critics were hurting the "well-being" of his family.
The Policymakers' Summary is even more disturbing. It makes no mention of the fact that satellite data show no warming, but renders the verdict that "the balance of the evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate." Depending on how you look at it, the statement is either meaningless or a truism. Of course organisms, including people, have significant impacts on the environment and climate in which they live -- we wouldn't have the current balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in our atmosphere if it weren't for the activities of photosynthetic plants and the respiration of animals, for example. The relevant questions are what kind of influence and how significant. On a literal reading, these are questions the statement begs. The only reason for including it, therefore, would seem to be to allow its authors to imply something the facts cannot support stating directly.
So what about "the vast majority of the world's climate scientists" cited by Mr. Clinton? Well, according to S. Fred Singer, emeritus professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia, about 2,100 people were listed as reviewers and contributors on the IPCC report published in 1996. Most, however, aren't climate scientists at all, but scientists from other fields, policy experts or government representatives. There were only about 80 authors of the main report, and the Policymakers' Summary (which many key contributors do not support) was written by just a few. Compare this with about 100 climate scientists who signed the Leipzig Declaration in 1996, questioning the validity of computer-based global warming forecasts, and the debate seems less one-sided than many claim.
Even that, however, is ultimately beside the point. That this has become a purely political debate is shown by the emphasis constantly placed on who is saying what. It is silly to claim, as many do, that scientists taking money from industry are somehow more liable to corruption than those who depend on propounding alarmist theories to renew their government grants. But more fundamentally, the ground rules of scientific procedure are such that it is easy to spot intentional bias.
The "trust us" attitude displayed by some politicians and scientists doesn't wash. This debate is comprehensible by anyone with the ability to read temperature data and a basic understanding of scientific method. Recent temperature data show no unambiguous trend, and we know that there were many swings in global temperature before man started pouring greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
As for the computer models used to make predictions of future warming, even the term "junk science" would be too kind. Science operates based on clear and testable -- that is, falsifiable -- hypotheses. The problem is, predictive models (which don't even correlate well to past data) are unfalsifiable first because we can't foresee the future, and because even if we could, we have no "control Earth" (that is, without man-made greenhouse gases) with which to compare it. As senior NASA scientist Roy W. Spencer has written, "The theory of global warming will probably never be validated or falsified since we cannot put the Earth in a laboratory to run experiments on." The problem of falisfiability becomes even more stark when global warming alarmists blame any unusual weather (say hurricanes) on climate change.
To be clear, I am not saying that the Earth will not warm in the near future, but only that we have no evidence that it will. Even if it does, we won't be sure whether the change was man-made or part of a natural cycle, and the fact that so many scientists stood by while their work was misused will stand as a dark day for their profession. If, for example, as the IPCC's Santer claims, his revisions did not substantially alter Chapter 8 of the report, he should endorse the excised passages and state publicly what they clearly imply: That the IPCC document is not conclusive enough to serve, as is happening, as a justification for the impending global climate treaty to be signed in Kyoto.
Many, of course, argue that a treaty is the appropriate response to uncertainty -- an "insurance policy on the future," in Mr. Clinton's words. But this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept. Insurance redistributes the costs of individual risks among members of a larger group. The only "insurance" society as a whole can have against unforeseen problems is the wealth and technology to deal with them. A treaty that devotes a significant proportion of society's energies to phantom threats may actually increase our risk.
Imagine how much better our environment might be if we stopped worrying about global warming and concentrated on well-known problems like the deforestation and unsanitary living conditions that afflict many of the world's poor countries. As John Christy, a key contributor to the 1996 IPCC report, observes, recalling his days as a missionary in Africa, "Cheap energy means longer and better lives. . . . Every country in the world has benefited from {America's} burning of carbon."

Abstract: The vast majority of the world's climate scientists have concluded that if the countries of the world do not work together to cut the emission of greenhouse gases, then temperatures will rise and will disrupt the climate. In fact, most scientists say the process has already begun. Disruptive weather events are increasing. Disease-bearing insects are moving to areas that used to be too cold for them. Average temperatures are rising. Glacial formations are receding. I want to emphasize that we cannot wait until the treaty is negotiated and ratified to act. The United States has less than 5 percent of the world's people, enjoys 22 percent of the world's wealth, but emits more than 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. We must begin now to take out our insurance policy on the future. In the international climate negotiations the United States will pursue a comprehensive framework that includes three elements, which taken together will enable us to build a strong and robust global agreement. First, the United States proposes at Kyoto that we commit to the binding and realistic target of returning to emissions of 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. And we should not stop there. We should commit to reduce emissions below 1990 levels and the five-year period thereafter, and we must work toward further reductions in the years ahead.

Full text: Following is an excerpt from remarks by President Clinton today to the National Geographic Society on the proposal for stabilizing industrialized nations' release of gases that may cause global warming, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company:
The vast majority of the world's climate scientists have concluded that if the countries of the world do not work together to cut the emission of greenhouse gases, then temperatures will rise and will disrupt the climate. In fact, most scientists say the process has already begun. Disruptive weather events are increasing. Disease-bearing insects are moving to areas that used to be too cold for them. Average temperatures are rising. Glacial formations are receding.
Scientists don't yet know what the precise consequences will be, but we do know enough now to know that the Industrial Age has dramatically increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, where they take a century or more to dissipate and that the process must be slowed, then stopped, then reduced if we want to continue our economic progress and preserve the quality of life in the United States and throughout our planet.
We know what we have to do. Greenhouse gas emissions are caused mostly by the inefficient burning of coal or oil for energy. Roughly a third of these emissions come from industry, a third from transportation, a third from residential and commercial buildings. In each case, the conversion of fuel to energy use is extremely inefficient and could be made much cleaner with existing technologies or those already on the horizon, in ways that will not weaken the economy but in fact will add to our strength in new businesses and new jobs. If we do this properly, we will not jeopardize our prosperity; we will increase it.
With that principle in mind, I'm announcing the instruction I am giving to our negotiators as they pursue a realistic and effective international climate change treaty. And I'm announcing a far-reaching proposal that provides flexible, market-based and cost-effective ways to achieve meaningful reductions here in America.
I want to emphasize that we cannot wait until the treaty is negotiated and ratified to act. The United States has less than 5 percent of the world's people, enjoys 22 percent of the world's wealth, but emits more than 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. We must begin now to take out our insurance policy on the future. In the international climate negotiations the United States will pursue a comprehensive framework that includes three elements, which taken together will enable us to build a strong and robust global agreement. First, the United States proposes at Kyoto that we commit to the binding and realistic target of returning to emissions of 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. And we should not stop there. We should commit to reduce emissions below 1990 levels and the five-year period thereafter, and we must work toward further reductions in the years ahead.
The industrialized nations tried to reduce emissions to 1990 levels once before with a voluntary approach, but regrettably most of us, including especially the United States, fell short. We must find new resolve to achieve these reductions. And to do that we simply must commit to binding limits.
Second, we will embrace flexible mechanisms for meeting these limits. We propose an innovative joint implementation system that allows a firm in one country to invest in a project that reduces emissions in another country and receive credit for those reductions at home. And we propose an international system of emissions trading.
These innovations will cut worldwide pollution, keep costs low and help developing countries protect their environment, too, without sacrificing their economic growth.
Third, both industrialized and developing countries must participate in meeting the challenge of climate change. The industrialized world must lead, but developing countries also must be engaged. The United States will not assume binding obligations unless key developing nations meaningfully participate in this effort. As President Carlos Menem stated forcefully last week when I visited him in Argentina, a global problem such as climate change requires a global answer.
If the entire industrialized world reduces emissions over the next several decades, but emissions from the developing world continue to grow at their current pace, concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will continue to climb. Developing countries have an opportunity to chart a different energy future, consistent with their growth potential and their legitimate economic aspirations. What Argentina, with dramatic projected economic growth, recognizes is true for other countries as well. We can and we must work together on this problem in a way that benefits us all.
Here at home, we must move forward by unleashing the full power of free markets and technological innovations to meet the challenge of climate change. I propose a sweeping plan to provide incentives and lift roadblocks to help our companies and our citizens find new and creative ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Abstract: President Clinton pledged yesterday to "harness the power of the free market" for a multipronged assault on greenhouse-gas pollution, outlining a package of incentives and modest targets he says will counter global warming while allowing businesses to prosper. Clinton released long-awaited details of his climate change policy in a speech that drew skepticism abroad and condemnations from both ends of the U.S. political spectrum. But others praised the president for committing to a serious, if cautious, plan for addressing what many scientists see as the planet's greatest environmental threat. Clinton outlined a strategy that beginning in 1998 would offer $5 billion in tax breaks and other incentives to U.S. companies to encourage rapid improvements in fuel efficiency and spur the development of new "clean-energy" technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He also called for an international emissions trading system that would earn credits for companies that cut pollution, and he promised further reductions under an ambitious restructuring of the electric utilities industry.

Full text: President Clinton pledged yesterday to "harness the power of the free market" for a multipronged assault on greenhouse-gas pollution, outlining a package of incentives and modest targets he says will counter global warming while allowing businesses to prosper.
Clinton released long-awaited details of his climate change policy in a speech that drew skepticism abroad and condemnations from both ends of the U.S. political spectrum. But others praised the president for committing to a serious, if cautious, plan for addressing what many scientists see as the planet's greatest environmental threat.
"We must begin now to take out our insurance policy on the future," Clinton told about 400 invited government officials and guests at the National Geographic Society. He said global warming "is real," and the "consequences, sooner or later, will be destructive for America and for the world."
Clinton outlined a strategy that beginning in 1998 would offer $5 billion in tax breaks and other incentives to U.S. companies to encourage rapid improvements in fuel efficiency and spur the development of new "clean-energy" technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He also called for an international emissions trading system that would earn credits for companies that cut pollution, and he promised further reductions under an ambitious restructuring of the electric utilities industry.
But the specific goals and timet ables he proposed for cutting international emissions fall far short of what some scientists and many environmentalists say are needed. They also are considerably less ambitious than the proposals proffered by other industrial powers.
The president's plan calls for stabilizing the industrialized world's output of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases at 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 -- followed by further, unspecified reductions by 2017. The European Union, by contrast, favors limiting emissions at 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010.
Talks are underway this week in Bonn, Germany, to try reach an agreement on an international plan to be signed in December in Kyoto, Japan. The treaty would set mandatory ceilings on emissions by nations around the world and impose penalties on countries that fail to comply.
Some business and labor groups say that even the relatively modest restrictions sought by Clinton would strangle the economic growth, raise energy prices and put millions of people out of work. But Clinton said his program would actually boost the economy by increasing efficiency and creating opportunities for new products and markets.
"If we do it right, protecting the climate will yield not costs, but profits, not burdens but benefits, not sacrifice, but a higher standard of living," he said.
White House officials portrayed the policy as "bold" and a "win-win," saying the tax breaks, flexible guidelines and other inducements would minimize the negative impact on industry and result in deep reductions in pollution before the mandatory limits even kick in.
Officials said the plan does not mandate any increase in energy costs, but they acknowledged that prices for gasoline and other fuels could rise. The administration released no economic analyses showing what impact binding targets might have, saying it is virtually impossible to predict the effects 13 years into the future.
But congressional and industry opponents said Clinton's proposed "cure" would be far worse than the disease -- if global warming is indeed a threat at all. A coalition representing oil companies, electric utilities, automobile manufactures and farm groups have launched a multimillion dollar advertising to generate opposition to a treaty in Kyoto.
"The Clinton-Gore global climate plan threatens the quality of life for all Americans," said Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.). He said the restrictions would "result in higher energy prices for working Americans and send U.S. jobs overseas."
But some business groups -- especially those representing alternative energy technologies -- praised the president's plan. "This is a measured, appropriate action plan, given what we know about global warming," said Terry Thorn, senior vice president of Enron Corp. of Houston.
More than a dozen senior executives representing such companies as Nike Inc., Bechtel Group Inc. and Mitsubishi Motor Corp. have endorsed a newspaper ad running this week that calls for "strong leadership" by the United States on climate change.
Reaction among environmental groups was mixed. Several mainstream groups that were prepared to endorse the president's package were deeply disappointed when the final details became public. "The air went out of the balloon," said John Adams, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
"The president has recognized that the global warming train is bearing down on the planet. But the policy announced today will not go nearly far enough to get us out of harm's way," Adams said.
The proposal falls short of the goals that Clinton outlined in 1993, when he called for voluntary cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. The administration says that goal is not longer possible because the economy has grown more rapidly than expected.
Some environmentalists said the incentives for immediate cuts in greenhouse gases in the new proposal more than atoned for any shortcomings in the proposed pollution ceilings and timetables.
"The president's proposal puts the United States in the thick of the negotiations rather than on the fringe," Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist with the Environmental Defense Fund. "For the first time there is a good chance of a constructive outcome at Kyoto."
Still, with less than two months remaining before the Kyoto conference, the administration faced a difficult task in closing the gap between its proposals and those of its European and Japanese allies.
Administration officials found little encouragement in a new proposal by developing countries, which yesterday called for cuts even more ambitious than the Europeans' -- while essentially exempting themselves from any binding limits in the near future.
A statement by the "Group of 77" countries in Bonn sought commitments from wealthier nations for a 35 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020. It said poorer countries should be compensated for economic hardships that might result from efforts by the West to cut pollution at home.
Clinton, in his speech yesterday, said the United States would insist on participation by developing countries as a condition for signing any global treaty on greenhouse gases. But he gave no specifics.
"Exactly what participation will mean is obviously what our guys are going to be doing in Kyoto," said White House economic adviser Gene Sperling.

U.S. proposes gradual reduction of greenhouse gases
Canada now under pressure to announce position publicly as Clinton extends target to 2012 for mandatory measures
Thursday, October 23, 1997
WASHINGTON, OTTAWA -- With a report from Canadian Press

  

As the final negotiations on a global-warming treaty opened in Germany, the United States has proposed a moderate, gradual reduction in greenhouse gases that is likely to win few friends either at home or abroad.
After months of division within his administration, President Bill Clinton said yesterday he would agree to mandatory measures to reduce carbon dioxide, methane and other gases believed to contribute to global warming to the levels of 1990. But he also said that now would take as long as 2012 -- 12 years longer than he had proposed four years ago, and far longer than the European Union, environmentalists and others have urged.
Mr. Clinton also proposed tax breaks and technological innovation -- rather than energy taxes -- to attack global warming. He said they would help the world "take out an insurance policy on the future," calling global warming "one of the most important challenges of the 21st century."
His announcement puts enormous pressure on the Canadian government to say what it is willing to do to deal with greenhouse gases.
Canada now is the only country in the Group of Seven industrialized nations that has not made its position public.
In Ottawa, Environment Minister Christine Stewart both lowered expectations of environmentalists and signalled comfort to those worried that Canada will take drastic action at an international conference in December when she conceded that the federal government made a mistake when it signed the climate-change treaty at the 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil.
In signing, Canada promised to cut emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Instead, Canada has increased emissions by as much as 13 per cent and has been singled out by a United Nations report as one of the worst greenhouse-gas polluters in the world.
"I think that we made a mistake in 1992 at Rio in saying that we would make a commitment to level our emissions to 1990 by the year 2000," Ms. Stewart told reporters outside the House of Commons. "We didn't realize what was implied by making that commitment."
Environmentalists were upset with Ms. Stewart, because they see her as the strongest voice in the cabinet arguing for action on global warming.
They say Mr. Clinton's proposal will do very little to keep the planet from getting hotter or to protect it from the disruptions of a volatile climate. Those disruptions include rising sea levels, disappearing shore lines and more frequent violent storms.
"Ms. Stewart seems to be arguing that it was a mistake because it was a difficult commitment to make," said Robert Hornung, of the Pembina Institute, a environmental research and advocacy group. "The only reason we have not met that commitment is because this government has not had the political courage to do more than simply call for voluntary action by industry to reduce emissions."
Natural Resources Minister Ralph Goodale, meanwhile, said Ottawa may consider using taxes to curb emissions if all other means fail.
Speaking outside the Commons, he rejected the notion of a carbon tax, which would apply to fossil fuels, but said other tax measures were still a possibility.
A spokesman for Canadian energy producers said he was encouraged by Mr. Clinton's comments. Chris Peirce, vice-president of strategic planning for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said the idea of using incentives rather than sanctions was promising. The targets suggested by Mr. Clinton also are encouraging, he said.
"We think there are clearly some elements there that are moving in the right direction," said Mr. Peirce, whose 180 companies produce 95 per cent of Canada's natural gas and crude oil.
A spokesman for Alberta Environment Minister Ty Lund, meanwhile, confirmed that Alberta would reject any "legally binding" international agreement on climate change signed by Canada at Kyoto. Alberta is concerned that its energy industry could be devastated if Canada commits itself to cutting emissions to 1990 levels.
Mr. Clinton has made a global-warming treaty a pillar of his foreign policy, suggesting that it may be one of his enduring accomplishments. That sense of urgency was reflected in yesterday's remarks, delivered before the National Geographic Society.
"Make no mistake -- the problem is real," he warned, addressing scientists who deny any material threat in greenhouse gases. "If we don't change course now, the consequences sooner or later will be destructive for America and for the world."
Still, in proposing gradual reductions in greenhouse gases, Mr. Clinton was seeking characteristic compromise. Mandatory controls are to appeal to those who argue global warming is a problem and voluntary restraints -- which Mr. Clinton proposed in 1992 -- are not enough. His commitment to gradualism, however, was to appeal to an industry that fears binding controls will raise energy prices, create unemployment and suffocate economic growth.
If Mr. Clinton hoped to find a compromise, it seemed elusive. Senator Chuck Hagel, who sponsored a motion in the Senate last summer against global warming, said Mr. Clinton had not offered strong enough assurances that all nations -- not just the industrialized ones -- would have to bind themselves to the treaty. He predicted that the Senate, which must ratify the treaty by a two-thirds vote, would balk.
Other antitreaty groups, such as the Global Climate Commission, which represents utilities and automakers, also reaffirmed their opposition to any binding commitments.
Supporters, for their part, also were disappointed. They said a modest proposal would be fine if global warming were a modest threat, but they maintained that it isn't.
"If you look at the science and see the overwhelming magnitude of the threat, you can see that the proposal is embarrassingly light," said John Passacantando of Ozone Action, one of the many ad hoc organizations lobbying for the treaty.
"Lincoln did not free half the slaves, Kennedy did not want to go halfway to the moon, and Johnson did not move Rosa Parks to the middle of the bus."
Mr. Clinton's proposal comes days after the Energy Department reported that emissions of greenhouse gases rose 3.5 per cent last year, in contrast to 8 per cent in the preceding six years. The large increase is likely to lend strength to the calls from treaty supporters for Washington to do more.
The Europeans, for example, want to stabilize gases at 1990 levels by the year 2000. They want cuts of 7.5 per cent by 2005 and another 7.5 per cent by 2012. Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, those gases would only reach 1990 levels by 2012, and begin falling gradually over the next five years, probably by about 5 per cent.

U.S. official to set off flurry of high-level visits

Abstract: Pickering, who will be in India Oct. 17-18 and Pakistan Oct. 19-20 accompanied by senior officials from the State Department's Policy Planning Bureau, will do the preparatory work for the visits by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright - in late November - and the President. Administration officials said Pickering will engage in "broad-based discussions," in both New Delhi and Islamabad, which will be "comprehensive and forward looking and deal with bilateral, regional and global issues." Some officials categorically discounted a possible "deal" between the U.S. and India, in which the latter in return for more U.S. flexibility in the transfer of high technology to India would consider some "give" on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) - which India has refused to sign. But other officials said such a possibility "cannot be totally dismissed." While acknowledging that most of the high-level visits will include both India and Pakistan, the officials insisted that this did not mean Washington is indicating an equivalency between Delhi and Islamabad or doing it to recognize a balance of power in the region. One source said, "I think we are better off visiting both India and Pakistan because then we are less likely to be accused of showing a tilt to one side or the other than if we did visit only one country."

After a nearly two-decade famine of visits to India by high-level U.S. representatives, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Thomas Pickering, this week kicks off a veritable feast of visits that will culminate with President Clinton's in February.
Pickering, who will be in India Oct. 17-18 and Pakistan Oct. 19-20 accompanied by senior officials from the State Department's Policy Planning Bureau, will do the preparatory work for the visits by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright - in late November - and the President.

They said the "purpose is to exchange views and deepen understanding on a broad range of issues," so that when he returns he can brief Albright and the President, who would consequently be on top of the issues that would make up the agenda for the talks during their visits.
The officials said Pickering's visit is envisaged as enabling the Policy Planning Bureau and the South Asia Bureau at the State Department and relevant offices in the National Security Council to "chart the agendas" that hopefully would help put U.S. relations with both India and Pakistan "on track on the strength of each country's merits."
While some sources hoped Pickering's visit would evolve into a "high-level security dialogue" between New Delhi and Washington, other sources said it is far too early to be talking about or for that matter even thinking about "a strategic partnership."
The latter emphasized that "what we basically want to do is strengthen and deepen the relationship so that we (the United States and India) feel totally comfortable with each other and can discuss even the contentious issues in a mature way."
Thus, a strategic partnership is "not something we are looking for," as some staunchly pro-India legislators in Congress are advocating, the sources said. The sources acknowledged that Pickering would be discussing proliferation issues and regional issues, including India's relations with Pakistan and China and how the U.S. could play a catalytic role in improving these ties in a nonintrusive, noninterfering manner.
On the fringes of the United Nations General Assembly and the recent summit between Prime Minister I.K. Gujral and Clinton in New York, Pickering and India's Foreign Secretary K. Raghunath also discussed in "a general way" some of the issues, including security issues, that could figure in the talks when Pickering gets to India, the sources said.
Since Pickering is one of the senior officials in the State Department, having served in postings to several embassies, including the one in India, and holds the title of a career ambassador - the equivalent of a four-star general - the sources said he had an "excellent rapport" with officials belonging to all sectors in South Asia. Thus, the officials said, "he is one who can offer the best balanced judgment that is critical for policy making."
Some officials categorically discounted a possible "deal" between the U.S. and India, in which the latter in return for more U.S. flexibility in the transfer of high technology to India would consider some "give" on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) - which India has refused to sign. But other officials said such a possibility "cannot be totally dismissed."
The rationale among some senior officials that the U.S. needs to obtain some sort of a compromise with India on the CTBT is that unless some assurances are forthcoming, the Senate is unlikely to ratify the treaty. During their talks in New York last month, Gujral assured the Clinton that India "would be pleased to engage" the U.S. in further discussion on this subject."
But U.S. officials acknowledged that they are "very much aware of the reality" that Gujral is in no position to acquiesce to any compromise Washington may offer that could be viewed as a concession on India's stand on the CTBT, because of the weak position of government.
Soon after Pickering returns, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala will visit India on a "fact-finding trip," to get "a feel of how India tackles its enormous health and human services problems and how the U.S. could cooperate in these areas," officials said.
Meanwhile, State Department officials acknowledged that the schedule of Albright "is being formulated as we speak," and said in all probability she should be in India some time after Nov. 20 after attending an economic summit in Doha, hosted by the President of Qatar.
How long she spends in India and Pakistan will depend on how many days she spends in the Middle East, since the South Asia part would be an extension of this trip. "But at max (maximum), I don't expect her to spend more than three days each" in India and Pakistan, one source said.
The officials emphasized that Albright will not be discussing any contentious issues or carrying any proposals, but would only be picking up on some of the themes contained in the agendas prepared by Pickering and others. "Basically the idea behind her trip is to give the region a higher priority than it has enjoyed in recent years, and to show that South Asia will be on our radar screen," one source explained.
Following Albright's visit, Commerce Secretary William Daley will go out to India accompanied by some chief executive officers of leading companies, both top-tier and middle-tier companies doing business in India and exploring the potential of investing in India.
However, officials acknowledged that Daley's trip will hardly be as high profile as the one under taken by the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown two years ago, which resulted in the signing of $6 billion in memorandums of understanding.
But, they said, it would nonetheless include the signing of some business deals and establishment of joint ventures and "tightening up of some of the projects that are currently on tap." Reinforcing Daley's trip would be the visit of Stuart Eisenstadt, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs who was earlier the Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade. He will be leading a U.S. delegation to a meeting of the Joint Indo-U.S. Subcommission in New Delhi.
At about the same time, Tim Wirth, Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, will also visit India in order to lobby for India's support for the U.S.-led climate change accord that will be discussed at a forthcoming summit in Kyodo, Japan.
While acknowledging that most of the high-level visits will include both India and Pakistan, the officials insisted that this did not mean Washington is indicating an equivalency between Delhi and Islamabad or doing it to recognize a balance of power in the region. One source said, "I think we are better off visiting both India and Pakistan because then we are less likely to be accused of showing a tilt to one side or the other than if we did visit only one country."
With regard to Clinton's visit in February, officials said that it's "far too early" to even think about what will be discussed.
But they noted that the high-level visits by his Cabinet officials, particularly Albright, "will certainly set the stage for the President's visit and some of the issues that will figure in the agenda."
The consensus among all the officials was that a permeating theme in the visits by Cabinet members as well as that of the President would be the Indo-U.S. relationship and how "it can be further strengthened and accelerated for mutual benefit."
In this regard, the officials said the Administration was hoping that some of the knotty issues like the privatization of the insurance sector and the import restrictions that had forced the U.S. to haul India before the World Trade Organization dispute settlement body will resolved before Clinton's Air Force One enters India's air space.

Abstract: The Great Storm of 1987 was responsible for the worst destruction to hit Britain since the second world war. But 10 years later, some conservationists have decided that the storm was, on balance, good for the environment. Back then, a third of the trees at Kew Gardens, the nation's prized botanical centre, were ripped out of the ground, prompting Christine Brandt, a spokeswoman, to complain: "It is like our children are gone. Kew Gardens will never be the same in our lifetime." The 100mph hurricane winds killed 13 people and caused £2bn worth of damage. But Mr Kirby points out that the gales' impact on the natural environment was not confined to the Kew-style "blow downs which people have concentrated on". Their more common effect was to inject variety into plant and animal life by "punching holes" into woodlands across the south of England.

Full text: The Great Storm of 1987 was responsible for the worst destruction to hit Britain since the second world war. But 10 years later, some conservationists have decided that the storm was, on balance, good for the environment.
Back then, a third of the trees at Kew Gardens, the nation's prized botanical centre, were ripped out of the ground, prompting Christine Brandt, a spokeswoman, to complain: "It is like our children are gone. Kew Gardens will never be the same in our lifetime."
But 10 years on, Keith Kirby, woodlands officer at English Nature , the official conservation agency, argues that the environment reaped unexpected benefits from the cataclysm.
"For many the storm was obviously a tragedy but from the conservation point of view, it was quite beneficial," he says.
The 100mph hurricane winds killed 13 people and caused £2bn worth of damage. But Mr Kirby points out that the gales' impact on the natural environment was not confined to the Kew-style "blow downs which people have concentrated on". Their more common effect was to inject variety into plant and animal life by "punching holes" into woodlands across the south of England.
In many cases, new plant species have flourished thanks to the space and sunlight cleared by the storm. The starved wood sedge, which had become almost extinct, returned to a site near Godalming in Surrey in one of the more spectacular examples of the environmental improvements wrought by the storm.
The dead wood left on the ground by flattened trees also provided an ideal home for rare fungi, beetles and larvae. "Species associated with dead wood and decay are some of the most threatened because we normally manage forests for timber," explains Mr Kirby. "We don't normally leave dead wood around so anything that depends on it has been having a very tough time for the last 1,000 years."
But some environmentalists view the storm from a darker perspective, linked to global warming. Only last month Sir Robert May, the government's chief scientific adviser, mentioned the 1987 storm in a list of extreme weather events that could be evidence that the planet's climate is already changing.
"The indications from climate models are that . .. by the middle of the next century, the incidence of gales across the country is predicted to increase on average by 30 per cent if no major global actions are taken," he said.
Andrew Dlugolecki, group assistant general manager at General Accident , the insurer, notes that the 1987 storm was a "one-off" compared to ones in 1990 and 1993. But as one of the leaders of the insurance industry's attempts to promote vigorous action to combat climate change, Mr Dlugolecki believes extreme weather events are likely to increase in frequency.
A government study he helped prepare reckons the annual average cost of storm damage could double to £500m as a result of global warming.
Mr Kirby is unconvinced that the recent severe storms are a sign of climate change. But even he agrees that if they do become more frequent, Britain's woods and beetles are unlikely to be so lucky next time.

Tuesday, October 14, 1997
Toronto -- It would appear that Terence Corcoran has joined the ranks of those who believe that our economic system exists independently of our environment (Wild World of Corporate Green -- Oct. 7).
His statement that the preservation of some of our remaining natural environment will "destroy property and individual rights" is a perfect example of a conclusion unrelated to the evidence. Protecting the natural environment is simply recognition that individual and property rights must be balanced with the needs of the entire population.
Not content to provide us with just one non sequitur, Mr. Corcoran also infers that concerns about climate change are irrelevant because they only protect "wolves and grizzly bears." Dramatic climate changes will also have a serious impact on human quality of life and economic health, a fact that is slowly being recognized by insurance companies.
Perhaps it is time to remind those who would reassert the tired old anti-environmental rhetoric that human beings are animals, and we rely on the same environment as wolves and grizzly bears for survival. The natural environment will not change to reflect economic "realities." Our economic system must change to reflect the reality of the complicated ecosystem that we all -- human, plant and animal -- depend upon.

''Doubts on Cost Are Bedeviling Climate Policy'' (front page, Oct. 6) examines the costs of changing energy policies to address climate change, but the issue of avoiding the economic damages from climate disruption receives less mention. The insurance industry and public health community are not so sanguine.
Records from the National Climatic Data Center indicate that extreme weather events have increased in the continental United States and elsewhere. Droughts have become longer and bursts of precipitation more intense. Worldwide, the rise in severe wind and flood-related events has caused extraordinary losses for property insurers. Annual United States reinsurance payouts have risen sevenfold this decade.
To avoid the costs of climate disruption, a shift in priorities, credits, subsidies and incentives will be needed to help develop technologies that steer us into a renewable and energy-efficient future. The biggest surprise may be the better distributed economic opportunities produced by this transition.

An Oct. 10 Associated Press report ("Greenhouse gas proposal studied," National Briefs) describes the economic quandary the Clinton administration faces in trying to change energy policies that address climate change. In this debate, the economic damages from climate disruption have received only minor mention. The insurance industry and public health community are beginning to show major signs of strain.
National Climatic Data Center records indicate that extreme weather events have increased in the continental United States and elsewhere. Droughts have become longer and bursts of precipitation more intense. Worldwide, the rise in severe wind and flood-related events has caused extraordinary losses for property insurers. Annual US reinsurance payouts have risen sevenfold this decade.
Extreme weather events and increased climate instability can also have devastating consequences for human health. And outbreaks of pests and diseases can affect agricultural crops, fisheries, livestock and humans; and their impacts can ripple through economies. Surprises such as the enormous haze and pall stemming from Indonesia's blaze (deforestation compounded by severe drought), have acute and chronic respiratory impacts and are harming travel, trade, and tourism.
To avoid the costs of climate disruption, a shift in priorities, credits, subsidies, and incentives will be needed in order to develop the transitional, hybrid, and advanced technologies needed to steer us into a renewable and energy-efficient future. The biggest surprise may be the better distributed economic opportunities produced by this transition. PAUL R. EPSTEIN Cambridge FRANKLIN NUTTER Washington, D.C. Paul R.

Global-Warming Issue Bears Close Watching

Abstract: It's no surprise Americans increasingly conclude Washington is irrelevant to their lives. After all, things out there are going pretty well. Things in here have seldom been screwier. Why should people care whether the president greets his guests in the Oval Office or the Map Room? Whether the vice president makes phone calls at the office or at home? Janet Reno may be mad, but the rest of the country is just bored. There is, however, another less visible but no less raging debate going on here that could touch the lives of every American. Its subject: global warming. The White House is considering a plan that would reduce carbon-dioxide emissions in the U.S. to 1990 levels by as early as 2010. The efforts to make that happen, White House economists believe, could raise gasoline prices by 25 cents to 50 cents a gallon and electricity bills by 20% to 40%. The total effect would be equivalent to a tax increase of $100 billion to $200 billion a year. Global warming isn't just a fear; it's a fact-or at least as close to a fact as science usually gets. Average global temperatures have risen about one degree Fahrenheit during the past century. Moreover, research suggests there is a strong connection between average temperatures and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Over the next century, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is projected to double. As a result, the Earth's average temperature probably will rise by two to six degrees Fahrenheit.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- It's no surprise Americans increasingly conclude Washington is irrelevant to their lives. After all, things out there are going pretty well. Things in here have seldom been screwier. Why should people care whether the president greets his guests in the Oval Office or the Map Room? Whether the vice president makes phone calls at the office or at home? Janet Reno may be mad, but the rest of the country is just bored. There is, however, another less visible but no less raging debate going on here that could touch the lives of every American. Its subject: global warming.
Enviroskeptics, who have decided to let their grandchildren worry about their own air-conditioning bills, may be inclined to tune this out, too. They shouldn't. It isn't just about global warming in the next century. It's also about what might be done in the next few years to slow it.
The White House is considering a plan that would reduce carbon-dioxide emissions in the U.S. to 1990 levels by as early as 2010. The efforts to make that happen, White House economists believe, could raise gasoline prices by 25 cents to 50 cents a gallon and electricity bills by 20% to 40%. The total effect would be equivalent to a tax increase of $100 billion to $200 billion a year.
Global warming isn't just a fear; it's a fact-or at least as close to a fact as science usually gets. Average global temperatures have risen about one degree Fahrenheit during the past century. Moreover, research suggests there is a strong connection between average temperatures and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Over the next century, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is projected to double. As a result, the Earth's average temperature probably will rise by two to six degrees Fahrenheit.
That's where science ends and speculation begins. Some effects of global warming can be predicted. The melting of the polar icecaps would put beachfront property in Florida in jeopardy, and sugar maples would disappear from New England. But globalwarming worriers take the argument much further.
Ross Gelbspan's book "The Heat is On" -- which President Clinton was spotted carrying during his vacation -- predicts a biblical onslaught: hurricanes, droughts, waves of disease-carrying vermin, a general breakdown of the ecosystem, chaos and, ultimately, totalitarianism. (A quote on the book jacket refers to Mr. Gelbspan as an "optimist.") Those arguments should be taken with a large bag of rock salt. And one could speculate about some technological breakthrough that might eliminate the need for fossil fuels entirely.
But even without going to extremes, there is reason to worry. The more difficult question that faces President Clinton is this: How much should the nation sacrifice now to buy insurance against threats in the future? To do nothing would be irresponsible. But to pay $100 billion to $200 billion a year in higher energy costs is to pay a lot.
That's exactly the debate going on in the White House. The economists argue the cost is too high, given that the benefits are so uncertain. Environmentalists hate the very notion of cost-benefit analysis and suspect those using it are tools of the oil industry. We only have one Earth, they say. They also dispute cost estimates, noting the government's success in reducing sulfur-dioxide emissions at lower-than-estimated costs.
The current political environment makes the issues even more difficult. President Clinton, worried about how posterity will view him, doesn't want to ignore a problem that could wreck posterity. Nor did he enjoy being lectured by other world leaders at the Denver summit about how his government has failed to address the issues. (The Europeans and Japanese want to reduce emissions below 1990 levels.)
Vice President Al Gore feels the pressure even more intensely. He has built his reputation on environmental issues and can't afford to go into the 2000 election with environmentalists feeling he has betrayed them.
Yet both men know that proposing even something as modest as a 25-centa-gallon gasoline tax for this purpose wouldn't sell with the American public, which is busy buying gas-guzzling sports vehicles, or with Congress.
So what to do? Mr. Clinton will probably try to have it both ways. He will commit to stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels by either 2010 or perhaps 2015 or 2020 but will be vague about the costs. Instead of a tax, he will talk about an emissions-trading system but play down the effect such a system would have on energy prices. And his negotiators will make sure any language agreed to in Kyoto, Japan, has ample wiggle room.
Before the U.S public makes large sacrifices to slow global warming, it will need to be convinced of the magnitude of the problem. On that score, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore still have a lot of work to do.

Full text: Up in walrus country, unhappy Eskimo hunters say the frozen sea is breaking up early these days. An ocean away, in the balmy mid-Pacific, islanders report the tides are suddenly stealing away chunks of precious land.
Things are going wrong out at the edge of the world, and people there blame global warming. But back in the world's capitals, where 1997 is the year for action on climate change, things are going slowly.
Behind diplomacy's closed doors, negotiators are drafting a treaty to control carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse" emissions, gases many scientists say are warming the planet. Emissaries are to gather in Kyoto, Japan, in December to sign the unprecedented new commitments.
After eons of talking about the weather, mankind may finally be ready to do something about it.
But as the weeks tick down and the debate heats up, the outcome looks less and less certain.
At preliminary sessions in Bonn, Germany, last month, the U.S. delegation once again took no detailed negotiating position. Reduction targets were not discussed. Those who favor decisive action grew discouraged.
"I am not very optimistic about Kyoto," Bert Bolin, a leading atmospheric scientist, said in a telephone interview from Stockholm, Sweden.
The planetary debate pits rich countries against poor, islands against continents, oil producers against conservationists.
It means many things to many people. American negotiator Tim Wirth calls climate change the top "environmental challenge" of our time. But U.S. industrialists describe the treaty negotiations as the century's most important "economic decision."
The environment vs. the economy: The fear of damage from a changing climate weighed against the fear of lost business and jobs from energy restraints.
In the end, Kyoto may produce an incomplete agreement, a basis for more talk and small steps forward, a process like the world trade negotiations, which covered almost a half-century.
And while diplomats duel, scientists work - atop glaciers, in air-monitoring stations, through satellite launches - to clear up nagging uncertainties still clouding climate change.
There is nothing uncertain about the underlying theory.
In 1898, as industry expanded in Europe and America, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius warned that carbon dioxide pouring into the atmosphere would trap more of the Earth's heat - like the glass of a greenhouse.
Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other gases that trap heat are transparent to incoming sunlight, but absorb the infrared radiation that Earth, maintaining its heat balance, emits back to space.
Fuel combustion - in engines powering everything from automobiles to electricity plants - is the biggest man-made source of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Decomposition of organic waste is a major source of methane.
From 1800 to 1994, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere jumped from 280 parts per million to 358. And during the past century, the average global temperature rose by about 1 degree Fahrenheit.
Four of the five hottest years on record have occurred since 1990. Glaciers almost everywhere are in retreat, and oceans - which expand when warmed - have risen by 4 to 10 inches.
Reports arrive from across the globe of unusual seas and weather.
In Alaska, Charlie Johnson, a leader of Eskimo hunters, said the walrus harvest is down the past few years because the Arctic sea ice - the place where man meets walrus - breaks up earlier than usual each spring.
"The people in the villages and everybody else feels the ice is leaving earlier," Johnson said by telephone from Nome.
On the remote Pacific atoll of Nukuoro, in the Federated States of Micronesia, a rising sea has flooded the few acres where islanders can grow taro, their staple crop.
"If something's not done, Nukuoro is going to be abandoned," said John Mooteb, a Micronesia government official.
The sea can rise or fall for various reasons, oceanographers note. In the same cautious vein, scientists have long shied from flatly attributing the warming of recent decades to gas emissions. But in 1995 they crossed a threshold.
A U.N. report, produced with the help of more than 2,000 specialists worldwide, concluded that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human impact on Earth's climate system."
The scientific panel, led by Bolin, the Swedish climatologist, predicted emissions at current rates would raise global temperatures by an additional 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 and sea levels by 6 inches to 3 feet, inundating islands and shorelines.
Weather would grow more turbulent, and climate zones might shift hundreds of miles toward the poles, abruptly making regions wetter, drier, warmer or colder.
Some areas might benefit - from crop-nurturing rains, for example. But climate surprises could be devastating: Mosquitoes might bring malaria to new areas, for example, or the northern permafrost might soften, buckling roads and buildings.
Some skeptics remain. Some say the link to greenhouse gases still is not shown beyond doubt. Some note the consensus projections have broad margins of error.
"The signal of warming is gradually getting stronger," said David A. Randall at Colorado State University, who is editor of the Journal of Climate. But although the past century's warming "is definitely very strong ... one century isn't a long time in this field."
One doubter, University of Virginia climatologist Pat Michaels, acknowledges man has affected the climate. "My point," he said, "is not whether human beings change the climate, but how much and how."
The mainstream majority supporting the U.N. report concedes that big questions remain.
For one thing, a warmer world will evaporate water more rapidly, forming more clouds in the atmosphere. Depending on how and where they form, they may either cool or further warm the surface.
Another question: Will the oceans, absorbing enough warmth quickly enough, hold down rising air temperatures? Answers would make projections more precise. But answers may not come until after the world begins feeling the worst effects of warming.
"Despite the uncertainty, the risk of a significant change of climate does not go away," Bolin said. He said political leaders must act on "risk analysis."
In 1992, they acted by postponing. A 165-nation treaty on climate change called for voluntary emissions cutbacks. That failed and in 1995 governments agreed to toughen the treaty by negotiating mandatory rollbacks by industrial nations.
Island states proposed that by 2005, emissions be cut by 20 percent below 1990 levels. The European Union favors a 15 percent reduction by 2010.
Such proposals don't prescribe how to do it, but studies suggest a range of ways: switching from coal and oil to nuclear or solar energy; developing more fuel-efficient engines; ending subsidies and imposing heavier taxes on carbon fuels; saving forests, which consume carbon dioxide.
President Clinton has pledged a "strong American commitment to realistic and binding limits." But the United States, responsible for one-quarter of global emissions, has yet to commit to specific targets and timetables.
American business lobbyists contend emissions reductions could wipe out hundreds of thousands of jobs in the coal, oil, chemical and other industries - in part because companies would move operations to developing countries. And the U.S. Senate declared, by a 95-0 vote, it will not ratify a treaty that does not also require emission cutbacks in the developing world.
Behind the scenes, the Clinton administration is readying a proposal expected to bring developing countries under the treaty in some new way and to introduce emissions-quota "trading" and other devices making compliance more flexible.
To build U.S. public support, Clinton has scheduled a White House conference on climate change for early October. But the slow movement in Washington still worries others.
"We should take care that what the U.S. Congress has proposed is not going to stalemate the rest of the negotiations," said Robert Wester, spokesman for the Dutch Environment Ministry.
Washington is not alone. Japan, Australia and some other nations, under pressure from local industry, also are reluctant partners in the talks, whose complexity is producing unlikely alliances.
British Petroleum, for example, a big player in solar energy, has broken ranks with other oil producers to stand with environmentalists. And insurance companies, fearing mounting damage claims from higher sea levels, floods, storms and other severe weather, support quick action against climate change.
"A lot is going on behind the business lobbying," said Michael Zammit Cutajar, the Maltese official who is executive secretary for the negotiations.
With the treaty in mind, industry is working hard on energy-saving technologies, he said. "Those who get there first with a low-emission car engine, for example, stand to make a lot of money."
He believes Kyoto may produce an immediate accord on cutback targets - most think no more than 10 percent - and agreement in principle in other areas. Those might include coverage of developing countries and market-based compliance systems.
Then the talks would continue, round for round, like the long-running trade negotiations, Zammit Cutajar said.
"Kyoto is another step on a long road."

Abstract: HOMEOWNERS in areas prone to subsidence may face higher insurance premiums after a surge in claims. Norwich Union predicts that 1997 will set a new record for claims - up more than 15 per cent in value from last year. Commercial Union expects an increase this year of between 30 and 50 per cent - 'and there is no indication this will be tailing off'. Figures from the Association of British Insurers suggest claims are 'on an upward trend' - totalling pounds 170 million from more than 21,000 householders in the first half of the year. Lack of moisture is a prime ingredient in most subsidence. The Norwich Union view is supported by subsidence expert Dr Mike Crilly at the Building Research Establishment: 'If the dryness of the last three years carries on, we will see claims running at the same fairly high level. But I don't think that climate change happens that fast.'

Full text:   HOMEOWNERS in areas prone to subsidence may face higher insurance premiums after a surge in claims.
Norwich Union predicts that 1997 will set a new record for claims - up more than 15 per cent in value from last year. Commercial Union expects an increase this year of between 30 and 50 per cent - 'and there is no indication this will be tailing off'. Figures from the Association of British Insurers suggest claims are 'on an upward trend' - totalling pounds 170 million from more than 21,000 householders in the first half of the year.
These statistics are being interpreted in two ways. Norwich Union does not believe that premiums will have to rise. It says claims will fall again in the next few years. This view is based on an assumption that the climate has not permanently and suddenly become warmer.
Lack of moisture is a prime ingredient in most subsidence. The Norwich Union view is supported by subsidence expert Dr Mike Crilly at the Building Research Establishment: 'If the dryness of the last three years carries on, we will see claims running at the same fairly high level. But I don't think that climate change happens that fast.'
Others are more pessimistic. Chris Jordan of the Subsidence Claims Advisory Bureau in Bexhill says: 'There is a feeling that insurance rates will have to go up - probably early next year.'
Some companies have been marketing themselves particularly to people in low subsidence areas. This could mean higher premiums eventually for homes that are not 'cherry-picked' in this way.
The process of claiming may be easier after a new insurance agreement that came into place at the start of this month. The domestic subsidence tree root claims agreement, arranged by the Association of British Insurers, simplifies procedures if subsidence is caused by a tree in a neighbour's garden. This will particularly help homeowners in London and other areas of dense population, where tree roots frequently cross garden borders.
In the past, companies would sometimes spend months or years trying to establish whose tree was to blame for subsidence. If the tree was in the next garden, the insurer for the next door property would pick up the bill. Under the new agreement, there will be no discussion about blame in most cases: the insurer of the home where the damage is incurredwill be liable. The ABI says companies representing 'most of household business' are now signatories.
ON the other hand, more responsibility will be placed on homeowners to stop their trees causing damage. 'The owner of a neighbouring tree could be put under notice that their tree is likely to cause damage,' says Rob Hooker, surveyor at the Subsidence Claims Advisory Bureau. If the tree was not pruned back, the neighbours would no longer be covered by the tree root claims agreement and their insurance may be invalidated.
Many homeowners will need to take professional advice before they start pruning. Dramatic cuts can also cause damage - a swelling in the ground, known as 'heave', if there is suddenly an unexpected amount of moisture in the earth. If subsidence remains a problem, insurers are likely to launch campaigns to tell people how to manage their gardens. About 79 per cent of subsidence claims are caused by trees or shrubs, says the Building Research Establishment.
The recovery in the housing market is another factor in the increase in claims. People whose homes are inspected by surveyors sometimes find they have problems they were unaware of. This also applies to homeowners who remortgage.
Research by AA Insurance suggests that the areas most prone to subsidence include parts of Nottingham, Chelmsford, Portsmouth and London.

Abstract: I just spent a week in the crystalline air of the high desert of Northern Mexico - well, crystalline except for the cloud of black gunk that rose every day from a small nearby city and crept toward the mountains. Beloved Mexico is not a country where the muffler gets a lot of respect. I returned to the hill country of central Texas - land of blue skies and swift, green rivers - only to find the joint covered with gray smaze and under a steady ozone alert. Ozone alert is what makes your lungs labor like bellows and your head ache when you go out in it. I bring this up because it is part of the backdrop for a curious "debate" now going on.

Full text: Lungs have been on my mind lately, partly because I'm in the midst of my 2,917th attempt to quit smoking.
I just spent a week in the crystalline air of the high desert of Northern Mexico - well, crystalline except for the cloud of black gunk that rose every day from a small nearby city and crept toward the mountains. Beloved Mexico is not a country where the muffler gets a lot of respect.
I returned to the hill country of central Texas - land of blue skies and swift, green rivers - only to find the joint covered with gray smaze and under a steady ozone alert. Ozone alert is what makes your lungs labor like bellows and your head ache when you go out in it.
I bring this up because it is part of the backdrop for a curious "debate" now going on. "It's only in America that there is a debate over what's happening to the global climate," observed a German journalist quoted in Ross Gelbspan's new book, "The Heat Is On." In Europe, "the only debates are how fast and with what impacts the changes will happen."
Actually, there's not a debate - in the sense of opposing arguments each backed up with facts - in this country, either. What we have is scientific opinion, which is clear and close to unanimous, and a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign sponsored by corporate interests afraid that the scientists' findings will cost them money.
It's as though your doctor found a suspicious lump on you and did a biopsy and the test proved it malignant. But then your insurance agent, worried that his company would have to foot the bills, said confidently: "Oh, no, that's not cancer - that lump is just a spider bite." Would you listen to the insurance agent? Of course not. But the media in this country treat both arguments as though they were of equal weight and soundness because, you see, we have been trained to assume there are two sides to every story.
What you want to keep in mind as you listen to the escalating "debate" about global warming is that the scientists have no financial stake in their findings. There's nothing in it for them; they're just reporting what they find. Nor do the environmentalists, who would prefer to spend their time saving whales, baby critters and the remaining wilderness if they weren't convinced that global warming is going to get us all first.
The book by Gelbspan, who has already won a Pulitzer for his journalism, details the propaganda campaign sponsored by oil and coal companies and OPEC governments, all with a vested interest in the continued burning of fossil fuels. In this country, the National Association of Manufacturers, automobile manufacturers and the Farm Bureau, always a foe of environmentalists, have joined to fund a $13 million advertising campaign to pooh-pooh the notion of global warming and/or wildly exaggerate the economic consequences of doing anything about it. Until last week, when Ted Turner put the kibosh on it, their ads were blanketing CNN.
The 2,600 scientists worldwide who signed the report of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1995 agree on what is happening to the global climate, but their predictions as to the consequences vary with the computer models they use, ranging from quite serious to absolutely disastrous. The prospect of island nations sinking under the waves and coastal cities being inundated by the middle of the next century if nothing is done about global warming is the sort of nightmare scenario that seems like apocalyptic science fiction, and so lends itself beautifully to that standard human response, denial: Let's not think about it - let's watch the football game instead. But the insurance industry, which has its own obvious stake in the effects of global warming, along with a few progressive industry leaders such as the CEO of British Petroleum, are taking the effects of global warming quite seriously indeed.
The media, with our eternal tendency toward on-the-one-hand-this/on-the-other-hand-that, equal-time, fair-play doctrines, are doing a real disservice to the public. What we need is the kind of reporting that Gelbspan has done, showing the collusion of special interests against the public interest in perhaps the brassiest display of greed, lying and self-interest since the time all those tobacco executives solemnly swore to Congress that there was nothing addictive about nicotine. The depth of their irresponsibility, of their chutzpah, is just astounding - how dare they put their own short-term profits ahead of the lives of millions of people? Talk about no shame.
As if the battle of scientists against propagandists weren't bad enough, the whole issue now moves into the political realm, where you can be assured that big campaign contributions will have their effect. President Clinton, in an almost comically Clintonesque fashion, is waging a campaign to raise public consciousness on the issue while simultaneously dithering about how to negotiate the binding emissions caps at the December meeting in Kyoto, Japan.
The big problem there is the developed-vs.-developing nations, or the North-South dilemma. The industrialized countries contribute by far the most greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, but the developing nations are afraid that their fragile economies will be crushed if they are put under the same constraints as the big guys.
One optimistic school of thought on all this is that technology will cure the problems technology has created - that we can go to solar-powered cars, renewable energy sources, etc. But such new technologies depend on whether huge amounts of investment capital are put into them, and as we see, the big money is already sticking with the status quo. This reminds me of the great game plan: "Stupidity got us into this mess, and stupidity will get us out of it."

Abstract: President Clinton convened a conference on global warming Monday, as the White House agonizes over its posture at the forthcoming talks in Kyoto, Japan, on a world-wide global warming treaty. Mr. Clinton is eager to please his environmentalist supporters, but industry, labor and members of the U.S. Senate have told the administration that this treaty would wreck the U.S. economy, cost millions of jobs and provoke a flight of investment to more hospitable climes. If mankind had to choose between a warmer or a cooler climate, we would certainly choose the former: Humans, nearly all other animals and most plants would be better off with higher temperatures. The climate models suggest, and so far the record confirms, that under global warming nighttime winter temperatures would rise the most, and daytime summer temperatures the least. Most Americans prefer a warmer climate to a colder one -- and that preference is justified. More people die of the cold than of the heat; more die in the winter than the summer. Statistical evidence suggests that the climate predicted for the end of the next century might reduce U.S. deaths by about 40,000 annually.

Full text: President Clinton convened a conference on global warming Monday, as the White House agonizes over its posture at the forthcoming talks in Kyoto, Japan, on a world-wide global warming treaty. Mr. Clinton is eager to please his environmentalist supporters, but industry, labor and members of the U.S. Senate have told the administration that this treaty would wreck the U.S. economy, cost millions of jobs and provoke a flight of investment to more hospitable climes.
A crucial point gets lost in the debate: Global warming, if it were to occur, would probably benefit most Americans.
If mankind had to choose between a warmer or a cooler climate, we would certainly choose the former: Humans, nearly all other animals and most plants would be better off with higher temperatures. The climate models suggest, and so far the record confirms, that under global warming nighttime winter temperatures would rise the most, and daytime summer temperatures the least. Most Americans prefer a warmer climate to a colder one -- and that preference is justified. More people die of the cold than of the heat; more die in the winter than the summer. Statistical evidence suggests that the climate predicted for the end of the next century might reduce U.S. deaths by about 40,000 annually.
In addition, less snow and ice would reduce transportation delays and accidents. A warmer winter would cut heating costs, more than offsetting any increase in air conditioning expenses in the summer. Manufacturing, mining and most services would be unaffected. Longer growing seasons, more rainfall and higher concentrations of carbon dioxide would benefit plant growth. Already there is evidence that trees and other plants are growing more vigorously. Although some locales may become too dry, too wet or too warm, on the whole mankind should benefit from an upward tick in the thermometer.
What about the economic effects? In the pessimistic view of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the costs of global warming might be as high as 1.5% of the U.S. gross domestic product by the end of the next century. The cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, however, would be much higher. William Cline of the Institute for International Economics has calculated that the cost of cutting emissions by one-third from current levels by 2040 would be 3.5% of world-wide GDP. The IPCC also reviewed various estimates of losses from stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels, a more modest objective, and concluded that the cost to the U.S. economy would be at least 1.5% of GDP by 2050, with the burden continuing to increase thereafter.
The forecast cost of warming is for the end of the next century, not the middle. Adjusting for the time difference, the cost to the U.S. from a warmer climate at midcentury, according to the IPCC, would be at most 0.75% of GDP, meaning that the costs of holding carbon dioxide to 1990 levels would be twice the gain from preventing any climate change. But the benefit-cost calculus is even worse. The Clinton administration is planning to exempt Third World nations, such as China, India and Brazil, from the requirements of the treaty. Under such a scheme, Americans would pay a huge price for virtually no benefit.
And even if the developing countries agreed to return emissions to 1990 levels, greenhouse gas concentrations would not be stabilized. Since for many decades more carbon dioxide would be added to the atmosphere than removed through natural processes, the buildup would only slow; consequently temperatures would continue to go up. Instead of saving the full 0.75% of GDP by keeping emissions at 1990 levels, the U.S. would be saving much less.
It is true that whatever dangers global warming may pose, they will be most pronounced in the developing world. It is much easier for rich countries to adapt to any long-term shift in weather than it is for poor countries, which tend to be much more dependent on agriculture. Poor countries lack the resources to aid their flora and fauna in adapting, and many of their farmers earn too little to survive a shift to new conditions. But the best insurance for these poor countries is an increase in their wealth, which would diminish their dependence on agriculture and make it easier for them to adjust to changes in weather, including increases in precipitation and possible flooding or higher sea level. Subjecting U.S. citizens to high taxes and onerous regulations will help neither them -- the U.S. could buy less from them -- nor Americans.
The optimal way to deal with potential climate change is not to embark on a futile attempt to prevent it, but to promote growth and prosperity so that people will have the resources to deal with the normal set of natural disasters. Based on the evidence, including historical records, global warming is likely to be good for most of mankind. The additional carbon, rain and warmth should promote the plant growth necessary to sustain an expanding world population. Global change is inevitable; warmer is better; richer is healthier.

Abstract: IN the last column, we discussed the forces that challenge the implementation of the United Nations Climate Convention (UNFCCC) and how they were going to extremes to prevent the adoption of any meaningful protocol in Kyoto, Japan, in December. Government leaders have banded together under the AOSIS (Alliance Of Small Island States) banner and they were the first to table a protocol proposal at the Berlin Meeting of the UNFCCC. Among the other developing countries, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand have supported a strong protocol. A number of African countries, led by Zimbabwe, recently pushed for concrete action to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The AOSIS proposal is still the most substantive one on the negotiating table - calling for 20 per cent reduction of carbon monoxide emissions below 1990 levels by all developed countries by the year 2005. But not all of them are enthusiastic - Singapore has been one notable exception, ratifying the convention just recently.
Among the other developing countries, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand have supported a strong protocol. A number of African countries, led by Zimbabwe, recently pushed for concrete action to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
However, Asean, China and India have not come out to support the AOSIS proposal.
Within developed countries, Denmark has been the most progressive in taking action within its boundaries to reduce GHG emissions while pushing the EU to table a useful protocol.
The EU proposal, although considerably weaker than that from AOSIS, is still the strongest that has emerged from countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
After years of uncertainty and debate, the majority of the world's scientists, represented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), stated in 1995 that there was evidence of global warming as a result of gases being emitted by human activity.
The IPCC now favours quick action to curb global warming.
Among businesses, the renewable energy industries, including those dealing with gas and energy conservation, have over the last two years supported reduction action among developed nations.
The insurance industry also opposes global climate change, which is costing the industry dearly in terms of insurance claims arising from floods and storms.
The International Gogeneration Alliance has also been on the good side as their activities reduce the consumption of fossil fuels (and hence GHGH emissions).
Local authorities grouped under the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) have also been urging positive action as their members demonstrate various initiatives across the world to reduce GHG emissions.
Environmental groups, especially those organised around the global and informal Climate Action Network (Can), have been pushing for quick and meaningful actions to reduce GHG emissions.
But within Can there are shades of emphasis with Can Southeast Asia (Cansea) and Climate Network Europe pushing for the strongest possible targets.
Last year, Japanese NGOs organised themselves under an umbrella group (Kiko Forum) and urged the Japanese Government to provide effective leadership in Kyoto so that the resulting protocol makes a real dent against global warming.
In the United States, NGOs like Ozone Action and the Union of Concerned Scientists have countered misleading media stories and political campaigns that are being waged by the "forces of darkness".
The Sierra Club in Canada has been leading efforts to improve the Canadian Government's position while international NGOs like Greenpeace and WWF International have been working with Can to push the negotiations and action forward.
Malaysian environmental groups that are part of Cansea are CETDEM, EPSM and MNS. They watch developments in Malaysia while working as part of Cansea to ensure forceful lobbying for a useful Kyoto protocol.

Abstract: President Clinton convened a conference on global warming yesterday, as the White House agonizes over its posture at the forthcoming talks in Kyoto, Japan, on a world-wide global warming treaty. Mr. Clinton is eager to please his environmentalist supporters, but industry, labor and members of the Senate have told the...

Abstract: The White House turned over previously unknown videotapes of some of President Clinton's controversial coffees with financial supporters to congressional investigators, Time magazine reported in its Oct. 13 edition. Meanwhile, Attorney General Janet Reno said the Justice Department has no evidence that Clinton violated federal law by having campaign donors as guests at White House coffees or for overnight stays. But she announced a 60-day preliminary inquiry of Vice President Al Gore's telephone fund-raising. Some 27 anti-nuclear activists were arrested for trespassing while protesting the planned liftoff of a plutonium-powered spacecraft Oct. 13. The 500-strong demonstration at Cape Canaveral, Fla., was held one day after the White House approved liftoff of the Cassini spacecraft. NASA needed clearance for the $3.4 billion mission to study Saturn because it is carrying 72 pounds of plutonium. The plutonium is shielded, but protesters say Cassini still poses a serious health risk in the event of an accident. US Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz to skip a port call at Sinagapore and head directly to the Persian Gulf. The ship was ordered to the region from the South China sea after the US warned Iran not to repeat cross-border air attacks into southern Iraq. Such attacks violate a US-enforced "no fly" zone.

The White House turned over previously unknown videotapes of some of President Clinton's controversial coffees with financial supporters to congressional investigators, Time magazine reported in its Oct. 13 edition. Meanwhile, Attorney General Janet Reno said the Justice Department has no evidence that Clinton violated federal law by having campaign donors as guests at White House coffees or for overnight stays. But she announced a 60-day preliminary inquiry of Vice President Al Gore's telephone fund-raising.
Affirmative action, sexual harassment, and police chases are some of the issues the US Supreme Court will take up when it begins its new term today.
Astronaut Michael Foale said he was looking forward to family activities, windsurfing, and lasagna when the space shuttle Atlantis landed in Cape Canaveral, Fla. Foale's turbulent 144 days in space - the second-longest space mission for an American - included repeated equipment failures on the Mir space station and a harrowing collision with a cargo ship.
Some 27 anti-nuclear activists were arrested for trespassing while protesting the planned liftoff of a plutonium-powered spacecraft Oct. 13. The 500-strong demonstration at Cape Canaveral, Fla., was held one day after the White House approved liftoff of the Cassini spacecraft. NASA needed clearance for the $3.4 billion mission to study Saturn because it is carrying 72 pounds of plutonium. The plutonium is shielded, but protesters say Cassini still poses a serious health risk in the event of an accident.
Clinton planned to host a day-long conference today on climate change. The president and several members of his administration hoped to convince scientists, economists, and business leaders of the need for a binding agreement with other countries to cut carbon gas emissions. He is expected to push the idea that technology, energy efficiency, and sensible policies can significantly cut pollution without harming the economy.
US Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz to skip a port call at Sinagapore and head directly to the Persian Gulf. The ship was ordered to the region from the South China sea after the US warned Iran not to repeat cross-border air attacks into southern Iraq. Such attacks violate a US-enforced "no fly" zone.
Hundreds of thousands of men gathered in Washington to pray and profess their devotion to God during an evangelical revival meeting. Organized by the Promise Keepers, the fastest-growing Christian evangelical movement in America in recent years, the male-only event may have been the largest religious gathering ever held in the US.
BeefAmerica, a meatpacker in Norfolk, Neb., recalled more than 440,000 pounds of hamburger because of suspected contamination by E.coli bacteria. It was the second major beef recall in the US in less than two months. Meanwhile, South Korea said it will send experts to Nebraska to check quarantine procedures after finding E. coli in beef imports from the US.
Serious crimes reported to the police in the US were down by 3 percent in 1996 for the fifth annual decrease in a row, an FBI report said. And the number of murders dropped by 9 percent over 1995 figures. But even with the decrease, a murder was committed in the US every 27 minutes, the report said.
The Congressional Budget Office lowered its estimate of the fiscal 1997 federal deficit to $23 billion from its August estimate of $34 billion. "As a percentage of GDP {gross domestic product}, the deficit would be only 0.3 percent, the lowest level since 1970," it said.
Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History walked away with a Tyrannosaurus rex fossil for $8.4 million after intense bidding at Sotheby's auction house in New York. Sotheby's had expected to sell "Sue," named in honor of discoverer Susan Hendrickson, for upwards of $1 million. The 65 million-year-old fossilized skeleton has a five-foot skull and is 90 percent complete. It is expected to go on display in 2000.
The World
Israel "is prevented at this stage from making reference" to reports that it was behind a bungled attempt to assassinate militant Hamas leader Khaled Meshal, a senior official said. Alleged Israeli agents, using Can-adian passports, injured Meshal in Amman, Jordan, but did not succeed in killing him. The incident caused an international storm of protest, with Canada recalling its ambassador for consultations and opposition leaders demanding that Prime Minister Netanyahu resign. Hamas found-er Ahmed Yassin was abruptly released from an Israeli prison last week, reportedly in trade for the intelligence agents. Netanyahu met with his Cabinet Sunday amid reports that more Hamas members would be freed.
Early voter turnout appeared light in Serbia but heavier in Montenegro for their respective presidential elections. Analysts said Slobodan Milosevic, president of the Yugoslav federation would be weakened politically if his protege, Zoran Lilic, lost in the Serbian runoff against ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj or if incumbent Momir Bulatovic was defeated by staunch rival Milo Djukanovic in Montenegro. A less than 50 percent turnout at the polls would force yet another election.
A possible new confrontation with President Yeltsin loomed as nationalist and Communist leaders in the lower house of Russia's Parliament said they would block his proposed 1998 budget today. Deputy Speaker Sergei Baburin said consideration of the budget would only follow a no-confidence vote in the government. But the vows came as creditors were to meet in London to re-schedule Russia's $35 billion debt, opening the way for a higher credit rating when the government wants to borrow more money. Last week, Yeltsin hinted he might dissolve the Communist-dominated Duma for obstructing economic reforms.
Muslim rebels believed to be from the Armed Islamic Group took their insurgency against Algeria's government to a new level, firing rockets at a town 30 miles south of Algiers that is used as a garrison by government troops. The attack left 12 people dead and 85 others hospitalized, newspaper reports said. Another 95 people died in assaults elsewhere, among them 20 members of a wedding party.
The volatile border between India and Pakistan was reported quiet for the first time in weeks after the prime ministers of the two countries ordered their forces to stop shelling each other. Forty-seven people died last week in the artillery duels, which each side accused the other of starting.
Indonesia "deeply apologizes" for the thick blanket of smoke over much of southeast Asia but needs more time to put out the fires causing it, President Suharto said. It was his second such apology in recent days. At Armed Forces Day ceremonies, he ordered the military to do more to quench the hundreds of fires, which have brought angry complaints from across the region. Two Australian planes designed to drop water on fires were due to arrive tomorrow.
Afghanistan's Taliban movement acknowledged losing several key positions around Mazaar-e-Sharif, the last opposition stronghold in the country. Among them was the airport. The Taliban had threatened the city for more than three weeks and only last Wednesday said its troops were at the city gates.
Donations of food by the international community have staved off mass starvation, malnutrition, and waves of refugees from North Korea for now, a UN official said. Namanga Ngongi, director of the World Food Program, said more than 90 percent of the projected aid needs had been donated and that children who were in "terrible condition" only a few months ago now look-ed much healthier. But he said twice as much assistance would be needed next year.
"In well-ordered countries, prime ministers ... resign over such things."
- Israeli columnist Zeev Schiff, joining calls for Prime Minister Netanyahu to quit in the wake of a failed assassination attempt against Hamas leader Khaled Meshal.
Etceteras
What does a police department do when its search-and-rescue dog turns up missing? Search for him, of course. Caesar, a 135-pound Rottweiler, was no longer in an Amherst, Mass., cruiser when his handler finished an errand in neighboring Chic-opee. The force put its best retrievers to work, and, happily, six hours later Caesar was found about a mile from where he had disappeared.
"Candle in the Wind," revived by Elton John for the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, has been adapted yet again for a burning issue. From Singapore, via the Internet, come modified lyrics lamenting the loss of blue sky because of the thick haze over southeast Asia. It's from unchecked forest fires.
Speaking of Diana, her death has produced more coverage in the British press than even the end of World War II, a London clipping service says. Durrants, in business since 1880, says its comparisons show major papers have given an average of 35 percent of their news space to Diana versus 26 to 27 percent for such developments as the defeat and surrender of Nazi Germany.
The Day's List
Companies With Most Women Directors
All but 81 of the Fortune 500 companies have women on their boards of directors, an annual survey found. But New York-based Catalyst research group says only two companies have added women to their boards this year - a growth rate of less than 3 percent. In all, women hold just under 11 percent of the 500's 6,081 directors seats. These companies have the most women directors:
Five directors
College Retirement Equities Fund
Golden West Financial
Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association
Four directors
Aetna Inc.
Avon Products
Fannie Mae

Abstract: China begins two weeks of bilateral talks in Geneva with its main trading partners, in the hope of making progress in its 11-year-old application to join the World Trade Organisation . However, Beijing has yet to present a new offer on opening up its potentially vast services market which the US, European Union and other trading powers say is essential for a deal. The talks come ahead of the Washington summit on October 28 between US President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin when China's WTO membership will be on the agenda. The fraught trade relationship between the European Union and the US will be discussed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. The European Commission has warned the US not to take action, under the d'Amato-Kennedy act, against the French oil company Total which has signed a contract to develop an oilfield in Iran. Ministers will discuss reconstruction in Bosnia, and on Tuesday hold talks with the government of Cyprus which is due to start negotiations on entry into the EU next year. President Bill Clinton hosts a White House conference with 200 chief executive officers, scientists, and local politicians, to discuss what the US should do about climate change. Mr Clinton wants to raise awareness of the problem and consult public opinion before he decides what proposals the US will take to international negotiations in Kyoto in December. The talks aim to curb developed countries' emissions of greenhouse gases associated with climate change.

Foreign ministers meet
The fraught trade relationship between the European Union and the US will be discussed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. The European Commission has warned the US not to take action, under the d'Amato-Kennedy act, against the French oil company Total which has signed a contract to develop an oilfield in Iran. Ministers will discuss reconstruction in Bosnia, and on Tuesday hold talks with the government of Cyprus which is due to start negotiations on entry into the EU next year.
Platform tickets
Railway officials from around the world meet in Marrakesh for a five-day conference on the increasing involvement of the private sector in the previously largely publicly owned rail industry. The conference, organised by the International Railway Congress Association and the International Union of Railways , will also look at the way the cost of rail and competing modes of transport are compared and suggest that, when like is compared with like, rail is financially viable.
War on climate change
President Bill Clinton hosts a White House conference with 200 chief executive officers, scientists, and local politicians, to discuss what the US should do about climate change. Mr Clinton wants to raise awareness of the problem and consult public opinion before he decides what proposals the US will take to international negotiations in Kyoto in December. The talks aim to curb developed countries' emissions of greenhouse gases associated with climate change.

Time to pay
The European Commission holds a public hearing as part of the consultation towards a directive tackling the problem of late payment in commercial transactions.
Terror talk
Anti-terrorism experts from the Association of South East Asian Nations join police and government officials in Tokyo for a two-day conference to discuss ways to strengthen regional co-operation against terrorism.

Full text:   The heat is on.
With steps to combat global warming scheduled for international action later this year, supporters are painting detailed scenarios of the deaths, floods - and droughts - that rising temperatures might bring to Philadelphia and other cities.
At the Jersey shore, barrier islands could face unprecedented erosion.
On the Delaware River, tides could rise 1.8 to 4 feet, pushing saltwater farther upstream and possibly threatening city drinking water intakes in Torresdale.
And in Philadelphia itself, heat-related deaths could double or triple, to 250 to 500 a year.
Those problems - and more - could arrive by the end of the next century, according to some climate scientists and advocates of cutting back emissions to curtail climate change.
``There is no sector of the globe, the economy, the environment and human culture that will not be impacted by climate change,'' said the Clean Air Council at Philadelphia, which today planned to release a scenario of potential local impacts.
In the other corner, industry coalitions are opposing limits on carbon dioxide emissions and offering their own predictions in a multi-million-dollar television ad campaign.
Pennsylvania could lose 32,200 jobs if President Clinton approves an international treaty to cut back emissions, says the Global Climate Coalition, an industry group that argues climate change poses no serious threat. Curbs on carbon dioxide emissions would affect manufacturing plants and utilities that burn fossil fuels, the coalition said.
The campaigns for and against reducing ``greenhouse gases'' - carbon dioxide and other gases that add to Earth's heat-conserving blanket - are designed to influence Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, soon to announce the United States' position for an international climate change convention in December.
Earlier this year, European nations proposed a 15 percent cut from the 1990 level by 2010, but the United States and some other countries balked at that target.
Meanwhile, scientists - whether for, or against, actions to stem potential global warming - agree there are major gaps in knowledge about what's happening with the climate. That's why predictions of what would happen from global warming vary widely - and why some scientists are skeptical there will be much of an impact at all.
While the United Nations-appointed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates global temperatures could rise 1.6 to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100, leading skeptic Richard Lindzen of Massachusetts Institute of Technology contends the rise will be well under one degree. ``I don't think we'll be able to tell whether it occurred even,'' said Lindzen, ``given the natural variability [of weather patterns].''
Most atmospheric scientists tend to go by the middle range of the predictions - a rise of about 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit worldwide, with local variations.
At that rate, the Environmental Protection Agency says, sea level is likely to rise 1.5 feet worldwide by 2100, with a 1 percent chance of a 4-foot rise.
At Philadelphia, that translates to a probable rise of 1.8 feet in the Delaware River - and a slight chance of 4 feet, according to tide tables prepared by EPA researcher James J. Titus. (The tables consider local tide trends as well as the worldwide effect of rising sea temperatures and melting polar ice.)
Among major potential area impacts, Titus said:
Salt water could advance up the Delaware from its usual stopping point near Chester. In a drought season, ``the Torresdale intake of Philadelphia's water supply is a little bit vulnerable,'' he said.
Droughts could be more severe, because even a projected 20 percent increase in rainfall wouldn't outweigh evaporation at higher temperatures, he said.
New Jersey groundwater that recharges from the Delaware could become salty, contaminating some drinking water wells.
Major storms could flood roads and basements in low-lying areas
Jersey shore beaches and tidal wetlands would suffer major erosion. The state's barrier islands and long coastline make it among the most vulnerable in the nation to rising seas.
Among the most vulnerable spots is Long Beach Island. But Mayor James J. Mancini of Long Beach Township says he's seen it all during his 38 years in office, including a 1962 storm that destroyed 600 homes, the dunes and eight miles of boulevard. The rebuilt resort still thrives.
``I think it's absolute nonsense to talk about retreat from the shore,'' Mancini said, ``because no one knows but the Man Upstairs what's going to be the situation 100 years from now.''
Meanwhile, the international panel estimates thousands of additional heat-related deaths and a million more malaria cases in the globe's warmer regions.
In Philadelphia, heat-related deaths could rise from a current average of 129 to between 250 and 500 deaths in 2050, said climatologist Laurence S. Kalkstein of the University of Delaware. Most such deaths are due to heart and respiratory problems.
If salt water did march up the Delaware to Torresdale, said Water Department spokeswoman Joanne Dahme, officials might have to consider either building a desalinization plant or moving the intakes farther up the river.
But Chuck Wood, a water expert with the U.S. Geological Survey, doubted ``any sea-level rise would get the salt that far.''
He said the city could face ``substantial problems along the waterfront,'' however. Such areas as the Navy Yard and low-lying parts of Columbus Boulevard could be vulnerable, Wood said, and ``flood insurance could become an endangered species.''
As for the sensitive freshwater marsh at John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum, ``if you add a couple feet of water to it, you turn what was marsh into river,'' Wood said.
But refuge manager Dick Nugent said he's less worried about the marshland than he is about neighboring developed communities. ``A lot of folks may end up with waterfront property unexpectedly,'' he said.

Abstract: Kyoto in Japan will host a meeting of world governments to consider legally binding limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. The result could be carbon taxes on coal, gas and oil. Energy policy analyst PETER READ, who teaches economics at Massey University, looks at some of the policy issues facing the Kyoto meeting. He serves as a freelance New Zealand expert with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and in 1994 published a book, Responding to Global Warming.MANY scientists doubt the global warming in recent decades is a result of human emissions of greenhouse gases. But it is wrong to conclude that nothing should be done. There are three core areas of ignorance. We don't know what the economic and ecological damage from likely climate change would be; we don't know how dangerous climate change relates to higher levels of greenhouse gases; and we don't know the costs of preventing greenhouse gas levels from rising. National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research project director Martin Manning rightly says that "policymakers are not responding to the detailed predictions of particular climate models, but rather to a fundamental concern that . . .rising levels of greenhouse gases . . .may not be safe". The concern is with difficult-to-foresee, low probability, but potentially catastrophic climate change.

Full text: Kyoto in Japan will host a meeting of world governments to consider legally binding limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. The result could be carbon taxes on coal, gas and oil. Energy policy analyst PETER READ, who teaches economics at Massey University, looks at some of the policy issues facing the Kyoto meeting. He serves as a freelance New Zealand expert with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and in 1994 published a book, Responding to Global Warming.MANY scientists doubt the global warming in recent decades is a result of human emissions of greenhouse gases. But it is wrong to conclude that nothing should be done.
With more than 150 other countries, New Zealand has agreed to take steps to prevent the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from reaching a dangerous level. That is the fundamental concern.
But the problem is to decide what to do, when we don't yet know what the danger level is. That's a policy question, not a science question.
New Zealand has also agreed to take least-cost precautionary measures if there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, without using scientific uncertainty as a reason for delay.
This is to avoid the irreversible situation that might arise if we proceed on a "business-as-usual" course, and if it later becomes clear we need to cut emissions to below the level of this decade. That gets my vote: driving the Desert Road in winter, I don't corner at speed to see how much ice there is. I slow down before I reach the bend.
There are three core areas of ignorance. We don't know what the economic and ecological damage from likely climate change would be; we don't know how dangerous climate change relates to higher levels of greenhouse gases; and we don't know the costs of preventing greenhouse gas levels from rising.
Of these, the first is probably unimportant. Estimates of the likely economic consequences are not very alarming.
National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research project director Martin Manning rightly says that "policymakers are not responding to the detailed predictions of particular climate models, but rather to a fundamental concern that . . .rising levels of greenhouse gases . . .may not be safe". The concern is with difficult-to-foresee, low probability, but potentially catastrophic climate change.
So is Greenpeace right to dub New Zealand's performance in greenhouse gas reduction "a disgrace"?
I doubt it. Changing our energy ways quickly is far from the least-cost path New Zealand signed up for. But changing our energy ways quickly is the favourite recipe for many, I suspect, because the big energy industries are an emotive target for greenies.
Finding the popular way costly, and not having looked much further, few countries will meet their Climate Treaty commitment. Those that do will do so either because of unwanted economic downturn (as in Eastern Europe) or because of a once-and-for-all shift from high-carbon coal to low-carbon natural gas in electric power generation (as in Britain).
The least-cost way called for in the Climate Treaty involves finding the most cost-effective strategy for changing our energy ways and being ready and able to do so quickly if necessary. It may involve turning land over to carbon-storing forestry, or eating less meat.
But it also involves controlling population growth during the next century and enabling developing countries to improve their living standards, thereby reducing the differences that provide the stimulus for further catch-up growth of output and thus of fuel consumption. Such indirect measures are likely to be far more important than bashing the energy industries.
When you boil a kettle, it "bumps" before it boils. When it boils, a change of regime occurs: what was previously a placid circulation becomes a turbulent maelstrom.
Such changes of regime are quite common in the complex systems of nature, including the climate system. On the geological evidence, global climate can make sudden and dramatic changes: For instance, glaciation (the extension of polar icecaps into now densely populated regions) can apparently occur within a century.
The last 10,000 years of benign climate have seen the human species grow to global dominance. A few million primitive humans could survive through the previous glaciations by migrating to the tropics. The current 5.8 billion civilisation could not survive -- still less the 11 billion expected in 2100. And nobody will have forgotten how to make nuclear weapons.
Those 10 millennia were unusual, with stable pre-1800 levels of greenhouse gases around 280ppm -- compared with 180 during previous glaciations. Since industrialisation, levels have already risen to 380, and are accelerating. With our profligate use of fossil fuels, as we follow the pattern of "business-as-usual" growth, a doubling of the pre-industrial level will occur around 2075.
While the climatic consequences of rising greenhouse gas levels are extremely uncertain, we know that rising levels trap a greater proportion of the sun's energy that reaches the earth's surface. We don't know whether the resulting changes in cloud and ice cover will cause so much more reflection of the sun's rays that there will be a net cooling rather than a warming -- or maybe a flip into some quite hostile climate regime.
Even one chance in a thousand of such a catastrophe is a senseless risk to take. (A melt down of the polar icecaps would put many cities below sea level.) By comparison, since Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, nuclear reactor components have been designed to have a one-in-a-billion risk of failure.
Several models now predict the Atlantic's Gulf Stream -- the warm ocean current that keeps high northern latitudes habitable -- could cease flowing at greenhouse gas levels that could be reached around the end of the next century under some "business-as-usual" scenarios of fossil fuel growth.
Short of such a catastrophe, extreme weather events -- floods and hurricanes leading to insurance claims of more than $1 billion, unheard of a few decades ago -- are rising sharply. One definition of a dangerous level of greenhouse gases is one that results in such events so often that major regions, including rich Florida and poor Bangladesh, have to be abandoned.
One of the problems in dealing with the problem is that, although the developed countries of the "North" created the problem, the developing countries in the "South" must be persuaded to join in its solution.
Fortunately, the technologies for doing without coal -- and eventually oil -- exist: They involve both raising the efficiency of energy end use and the replacement of coal with biofuel (i.e.
burnable plant material that has absorbed its carbon content from the atmosphere during its growth process) and various kinds of ambient energy (e.g. wind generators and, importantly in the long run, photo- voltaic cells). Capturing emissions from large boilers and burying them is a possible, but not cheap, option.
But deploying these technologies widely and soon in the North involves the high costs of premature obsolescence. The need is to "learn by doing"; to bring the costs down with limited deployment, as old plant is retired; to meet growing demands in the South through the transfer of proven sustainable technologies; and eventually to deploy them fully in the North as old plant is retired.
And the key to such a change of technological direction lies in involving the energy industries positively in their own transformation, not bashing them over the head with carbon taxes. Taxes extract the funds needed for technological innovation and just lead to higher energy prices.
Energy Minister Max Bradford has challenged the industry to take a more pro-active role in voluntary change than it has under the government-driven programme of "Voluntary Agreements". This challenge should be taken up by energy suppliers if they -- and their customers -- are to avoid harsher and more costly measures.
If the warning sirens sound louder, raise two cheers for mad cow disease. Much the least-cost response is to eat less meat from methane-emitting ruminants, and to grow more biofuel on the vacant land.

Climate a victim in drive for progress: [CITY EDITION]

Abstract: What have Dublin's Luas light rail system, the Dublin Transportation Init iative (DTI) and Pacific coral atolls under threat of submergence to do with one another? More than at first meets the eye. Ireland produces only 0.1 per cent of the world's energy-related CO2 emissions, but its per-capita CO2 emissions are at the EU average, and it is a party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The EU is committed to stabilising CO2 emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. Ireland, however, in the interests of protecting its economic growth, has set itself the goal of an increase of 20 per cent above 1990 levels. Its emissions grew by 8.5 per cent between 1990 and 1994. By 1995 the increase had reached 10.5 per cent. Germany, in contrast, has undertaken to reduce its CO2 emissions to 10 per cent below 1990 levels by 2000. The urgency of the issue depends on the reality of global warming. Despite the lobbying efforts of "rogue scientists" in the pay of oil, coal and motor manufacturing interests, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last year formally declared "there is now a discernible effect of human activity on the global climate". We can expect average global temperatures to rise by at least 20C by 2100. Over the past 100 years, according to the IPCC, global mean surface air temperatures have increased by 0.3C to 0.6C, while global sea levels have risen by 10 cm to 25 cm. Though it is impossible to predict exactly what the effects will be, such fluctuation is unprecedented in the 10,000 years since the last ice age. A worldwide increase in storms, droughts, floods and sea-level rises of 20 cm by 2030 and up to 60 cm by 2100 are being predicted.

A worldwide increase in storms, droughts, floods and sea-level rises of 20 cm by 2030 and up to 60 cm by 2100 are being predicted.
This would threaten the very existence of many low-lying small island states, some of which have already experienced king tides, storm surges and an increase in the frequency of tropical cyclones. The resulting inundation of coastal regions could produce as many as 150 million refugees. Coral polyps, living organisms whose shells form the reefs and atolls that make the Pacific an area of spectacular natural beauty, are already dying as a result of water temperatures rising above the 28C mean they need in order to survive, leading to coral bleaching throughout Polynesia.
But as UN delegates might remark in unguarded moments between official sessions, "Who cares about coral reefs?" Why should the fate of a few million people living on insignificant specks in the vast Pacific be a brake on economic growth and technological progress? The cynicism implicit in such questions reveals the utilitarian ethic that all too often determines decisionmaking by the world's power brokers.
The Pacific and its islands are not only unbelievably rich in natural species, they are also home to a greater variety of human cultures and language groups than anywhere else in the world. Though only 0.1 per cent of the world's surface area, coral reefs are responsible for 10 per cent of the world's fish catch.
An unusually high proportion of the languages spoken on earth are spoken in the south-west Pacific. In Melanesia alone, which has a total population of 4,550,000, there are 105 languages spoken in Vanuatu, 75 in the Solomon Islands, and over 800 in Papua New Guinea. Each of these language groups represents a distinctive culture.
The Pacific is a test case for an ethic based on the value intrinsic in nature itself, non-human as well as human - on care for life rather than rights of possession.
So what has all this got to do with Luas? The underground versus overground debate is seen in a different perspective once the projected effects of climate change are grasped. While Ireland is permitting itself to overshoot the EU CO 2 reduction target, itself woefully inadequate, by 20 per cent, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) has been calling for a cut in CO 2 emissions to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2000 (known since 1988 as the Toronto Target).
When the catastrophic effects of climate change are really faced, such as the ever more frequently occurring El Nino phenomenon, caused by rising Pacific water temperatures, it becomes apparent how drastic the countermeasures will have to be.
Every significant amelioration of the greenhouse effect, no matter how costly to Western and Asian economies accustomed to steady growth and increasing prosperity, becomes crucial.
Yet Pacific rim countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada and the United States still opposed the AOSIS protocol at the Berlin Climate Summit in 1995, which is not surprising when one learns that transnational corporations are estimated to be responsible for about 50 per cent of greenhouse gases.
The weather conditions which produced the floods of the century in central Europe this summer were equivalent to those which cause monsoons in Asia. Countries such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, which normally enjoy high tropical rainfall, are currently in the grip of severe drought, leading to out-of-control forest fires in the former and threatened famine due to crop failure in the latter.
The global insurance industry has identified a 40-fold increase in damages due to hurricanes and other weather extremes over the last 25 years. Of the 25 largest insured catastrophes in the United States, 21 have happened in the last 10 years, and 16 of these involved the effects of wind and water.
No wonder more and more international bodies, such as the World Council of Churches, are adopting the "precautionary principle" as the ethical basis of their approach to global warming: expect the worst and act accordingly if our calculations are out. It is more morally responsible to err on the side of caution when the survival of species and peoples is at stake.
Ireland, too, is a small island state. As a resident of Booterstown, living within sight of the sea, I sometimes wonder what would happen if the sea level rose by one metre. No more walks on Dun Laoghaire pier. Every storm, perhaps every high tide, would flood the DART line and close Rock Road. By then, though, Luas would be running further inland. If they ever get around to it, that is. Dr John May teaches Inter- faith Dialogue and Ethics at the Irish School of Ecumenics in Dublin.

Abstract: We know the outcome of the contest between science and religion. Science won. Or did it? Two millennia after the birth of Christ, the classic antagonists, faith and reason, are flirting with one another. It is not clear that the men and women in white coats are possessed of greater self-confidence than their adversaries. Yet at first glance you would think that religion is making all the compromises. The Roman Catholic church no longer denies the theory of evolution. It has apologised for the arrest of Galileo. As if that were not enough, Constantinople is outpacing Rome. The eastern orthodox branch of Christianity acknowledges that humanity is part of nature, that "we stand far afield from any dialectical opposition of matter and spirit, body and soul, or the present world and metaphysical reality". This opinion was given a fortnight ago by the first among equals in the orthodox church, his All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, a bearded gentleman in a black pillbox hat. His audience, 400 scientists, philosophers and priests, spiced by a handful of Islamic, Jewish and Hindu intellectuals, sat aboard the luxury ferry El. Venizelos. We circumnavigated the Black Sea in eight days, talking non-stop.

This opinion was given a fortnight ago by the first among equals in the orthodox church, his All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, a bearded gentleman in a black pillbox hat. His audience, 400 scientists, philosophers and priests, spiced by a handful of Islamic, Jewish and Hindu intellectuals, sat aboard the luxury ferry El. Venizelos. We circumnavigated the Black Sea in eight days, talking non-stop.
That exercise in verbosity may not be quite enough to save this cesspit of Europe from oil spills, industrial filth from the Danube and raw sewage outflows from Batumi, Novorossisk, Yalta, Odessa, Constanta, Varna and several similar ports. The dying sea may be beyond salvation. You might say the same of organised religion.
Faith in the Creation has been in danger of losing out to the scientific imagination ever since Galileo looked to the stars. All is not lost. For a start, we westerners should watch this Barthol-omew. He is aware of how to get action from the human segment of the natural world. You appeal to its inner voice, and keep onside with Uncle Sam.
The gossip on deck told us that the orthodox toehold on Istanbul might be loosened if nationalists or fundamentalists come to power in Turkey. The church's insurance is the US, which his All Holiness will visit for three weeks from October 19. He will be received at the White House. Bill Clinton is said to be "very" helpful. Perhaps campaign contributions from wealthy Greek-Americans encouraged the president to be helpful.
No matter. Mr Clinton knows that science and religion are talking to one another. His vice-president was in at the founding, five years ago, of the National Religious Partnership for the Environment , which is allied to the Union of Concerned Scientists .
We heard a touching story from the partnership. Its headquarters are at the Cathedral of St John the Divine on Amsterdam Avenue, New York. Once a year, we were told, they bless animals brought to church in an increasingly noisy parade. Even plankton, brought in glass jars by the billion, receive a blessing. The concerned scientists are less generous. They focus on climate change.
Responses to a recent US poll suggest that 40 per cent of working physicists and biologists hold strong spiritual beliefs. The two most prestigious US scientific institutions are looking to the heavens. The National Academy of Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science are both promoting church-laboratory dialogues. The long and bitter argument between the bible-thumping creationists and teachers of evolution may yet end in a truce.
If this sounds optimistic, consider. You can reinterpret the Old Testament, and the story of the creation, to fit contemporary physics, biology and genetics. It is possible, as I discovered on the El. Venizelos, to hear God described by a distinguished Anglican theologian as full of wonder but "no thing", which to my ears is as transcendental as questions about what preceded the Big Bang. The answer must be "something mysterious - no thing".
Bishop Basil of Sergievo sought to relate quantum physics to the cosmology outlined by Dionysius the Aeropagite. Dionysius wrote of a multi-layered universe, with angels, archangels, and the superior orders, the highest of which are cherubim and seraphim. You could say they are no things. One interpretation of quantum physics is that the universe is similarly hierarchical, with the lower particles unable to comprehend the higher.
Metropolitan John of Pergamon, a one-man theological think-tank who sits at Bartholomew's side, offered rationalists a deal. The trouble with science, we were told by many speakers, is that its practitioners focus on small slices of nature. Their knowledge is necessarily fragmented. They study the bee apart from the flower. Perhaps, John suggested, science was moving towards a "holistic approach".
If so, "religion (Christian theology in particular) must revise its views about the human being and admit that humans are inconceivable without their organic relationship with the rest of creation". Of course, the reverse was also true. "Religion - certainly Christian theology - is anthropocentric . . . and would insist that the human being is indispensable to creation." He saw science moving in the same direction. Bingo.
There are other agendas. The orthodox church needs modernising, Christianity needs to retain its congre-gations. Concerned scientists seek to save the natural world by making it unethical to destroy it. All this is insignificant beside a post-millennium reassessment of the source of our being: no thing. It is awkward for science to prove that. To religion, it is second nature.

Full text: So Premier Klein has served notice that Alberta opposed mandated limits on fossil fuel emissions ("Klein attacks global plan to limit greenhouse gases," Sept. 26, 1997.) What a surprise!
Canada may contribute only two per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions but Canada is the second-highest per-capita emitter of carbon dioxide in the world. And Alberta is the highest per-capita emitter in the world.
Alberta has its financial deficit in order and is starting to pay down its financial debt. Unfortunately, we have a huge environmental deficit and environmental debt which also need to be brought under control. Alberta's emissions of carbon dioxide are contributing to both our environmental deficit and our environmental debt. The sooner we start seriously tackling it, the less it will cost us both financially and environmentally.
Alberta needs to stop whining and start investing some of the wealth generated by the burning of fossil fuels into an energy future built on energy conservation and renewable energy.
Perhaps the countries which will suffer the most from climate change (such as the island countries which will disappear completely) and the insurance companies suffering devastating losses as a result of the increased frequency and severity of natural disasters should learn from the actions taken against tobacco companies. They could initiate lawsuits against industries emitting so much carbon dioxide and governments which refuse to control emissions.
Perhaps then Klein will realize there is a financial cost to not reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Canada should do its share to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and that includes signing on to legally binding reduction commitments in Kyoto, Japan, in December.

Wanted: a global warming policy that stands a chance.

Abstract: IT'S crunch time at the White House on climate change policy. With the meeting on global warming set for Kyoto, Japan, in December, the Clinton Administration has less than three weeks to come up with its own proposal before the agenda is locked in place by meeting planners and America is reduced to the role of commentator. Cynics have assumed that President Clinton would stake out the easy high ground, demanding more from developing countries (or the United States Congress) than they are prepared to give, thereby obviating the need for action. But the Administration is reportedly trying to piece together a plan that rapidly growing economies like China could live with, yet still buy some insurance against climate change. That is why White House policy wonks are now focusing on hybrid plans that limit greenhouse gas emissions, yet provide an escape hatch. The European Community is officially gung-ho to set ambitious emissions goals for the developed world and to meet them with the help of carbon emission taxes. The Clinton Administration, by contrast, is reluctant to agree to any policy with teeth unless developing countries -- notably China, India and Russia -- join in. Administration economists are especially taken with emissions trading plans that would allow private businesses in developed countries to pay their counterparts in developing economies to do the heavy lifting.

With the meeting on global warming set for Kyoto, Japan, in December, the Clinton Administration has less than three weeks to come up with its own proposal before the agenda is locked in place by meeting planners and America is reduced to the role of commentator.
Cynics have assumed that President Clinton would stake out the easy high ground, demanding more from developing countries (or the United States Congress) than they are prepared to give, thereby obviating the need for action. But the Administration is reportedly trying to piece together a plan that rapidly growing economies like China could live with, yet still buy some insurance against climate change. That is why White House policy wonks are now focusing on hybrid plans that limit greenhouse gas emissions, yet provide an escape hatch.
''The idea is to get started, but without fear of economic surprises,'' said Richard Morgenstern, a former Environmental Protection Agency official who is a researcher at Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan group in Washington.
The European Community is officially gung-ho to set ambitious emissions goals for the developed world and to meet them with the help of carbon emission taxes. The Clinton Administration, by contrast, is reluctant to agree to any policy with teeth unless developing countries -- notably China, India and Russia -- join in. Administration economists are especially taken with emissions trading plans that would allow private businesses in developed countries to pay their counterparts in developing economies to do the heavy lifting.
This opens two avenues for rationalizing doing nothing at all.
The Administration could earn brownie points with hard-line environmentalists by going along with the Europeans, effectively inviting the Republican Congressional majority to shoot down any agreement. House Speaker Newt Gingrich has already warned against an accord in which ''the U.S. would likely bear too much burden.'' And Republicans would no doubt go to the barricades before approving a new tax on carbon emissions.
Or President Clinton could insist that developing countries fully commit to both targets and means for limiting emissions before he presents the deal to Congress. This would seem statesmanlike while indefinitely delaying the need to ask sacrifice from Americans.
The ease of procrastination explains the new interest in hybrid proposals from serious policy types in the Administration who want the President to take the lead in Kyoto.
The idea is simple, says Mr. Morgenstern, who, in collaboration with Raymond Kopp and William Pizer at Resources for the Future, has outlined its virtues on the group's Web site (www.rff.org). The researchers would set limits on total carbon emissions and parcel out rights to emit that can be traded between businesses and perhaps countries. But they would also guarantee that no one would ever have to pay more than a ceiling price for permits in the private market -- say $10 a ton -- by having governments sell any number of additional permits at the ceiling.
If the ceiling price were low enough, business might be willing to go along. Indeed, a few companies -- most notably British Petroleum, which announced a voluntary emissions monitoring program earlier this week in conjunction with the Environmental Defense Fund -- seem eager for modest actions that reduce business uncertainty. And since proposed charges for added permits aren't necessarily ''taxes'' in the Republican lexicon, they, too, might go with the flow.
The concept is unappealing to environmental lobbies that want strict targets and timetables. But Mr. Morgenstern suggests that the hybrid approach would call the bluff of perennially optimistic enviros, who argue that there is a cheap fix for every problem. And it would please many economists, who want to set up a framework for efficient containment of greenhouse gases before the risks of climate change are fully understood. ''This would be a way to initiate a broad but realistic commitment,'' argued Robert Stavins of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
Warwick J. McKibbin and Peter J. Wilcoxen, authors of a climate change ''policy brief'' at the Brookings Institution (www.brook.edu), see other benefits. The price ceiling on permits could be set low enough, they suggest, to make it palatable for rich countries to begin containment without the cooperation of developing countries. Moreover, the chance to collect a fee on excess emissions would give revenue-hungry governments an incentive to enforce the standards.
The hybrid approach is too new to allow for a realistic assessment of its chances at Kyoto. But it is appealing on its face. More important, its prominence in current Administration thinking suggests that the White House is treating sacrifices in containing climate change as a problem in political coalition-building rather than a potential obstacle to Al Gore's election in 2000. ''The real choice is not between a sharp reduction in emissions and a more modest policy,'' Mr. Wilcoxen said, ''but between a modest policy and no policy at all.''

How to sell the world's water industry: Water is the poor relation of privatised industries. John Barham examines why: [London edition]

Abstract: Declan Duff, a director at the International Finance Corporation (IFC) , the World Bank 's lender for private sector projects, says the poor are prepared to pay very high prices for water. In Haiti, they spend 20 per cent of their income on water bought from local vendors. Elsewhere the rate varies between 5 and 9 per cent. However, few governments accept that the laws of supply and demand should balance the needs of consumers with available water resources or allow companies to finance investments by making profits. Yet water supplies dwindle as populations grow, the pace of urbanisation accelerates and climate change affects reliability of water sources. At an international conference on the water industry in Istanbul this week, Mr Duff said that by 2025 about 1bn people could suffer water shortages unless governments adopted "radical change" to ensure reliable water supplies.

Full text: Water is the last frontier in privatisation around the world. Governments are selling off power stations, telephone networks and other infrastructure, but water languishes as the poor relation of public utility business.
Although water is often regarded as so basic to human life that it cannot be treated like any other commodity, it is becoming so scarce in some developing countries that it now commands high prices.
Declan Duff, a director at the International Finance Corporation (IFC) , the World Bank 's lender for private sector projects, says the poor are prepared to pay very high prices for water. In Haiti, they spend 20 per cent of their income on water bought from local vendors. Elsewhere the rate varies between 5 and 9 per cent.
However, few governments accept that the laws of supply and demand should balance the needs of consumers with available water resources or allow companies to finance investments by making profits. Yet water supplies dwindle as populations grow, the pace of urbanisation accelerates and climate change affects reliability of water sources.
At an international conference on the water industry in Istanbul this week, Mr Duff said that by 2025 about 1bn people could suffer water shortages unless governments adopted "radical change" to ensure reliable water supplies.
Many governments lack the financial and management muscle to embark on large investments, yet are reluctant to start full-scale privatisation which would impose the rigours of market pricing on consumers. The World Bank says poor countries should spend $600bn (£375bn) on water in the next 10 years.
Few other public services are as politically sensitive as water. This means that techniques developed to privatise electricity or telephone utilities are rarely directly applicable to water.
David Suratgar, deputy chairman of Morgan Grenfell International , a London-based investment bank, says sources of finance for water are virtually the same as those for power, ports, tunnels and roads. The water industry, however, presents special risks that make such projects unique.
Financiers at the conference say most water privatisations tend to be too politically, economically and financially risky for banks or capital markets. Finding finance for existing water networks is hard because they offer limited security to lenders. Banks cannot dig up pipes to recover loans. New greenfield projects are just as hard to finance because they normally require little imported equipment financeable by soft loans from export credit agencies and have no proven income stream. However, a handful of utilities, led by British and French water companies, have signed deals in developing countries to manage existing water systems or build new ones.
In Turkey, Thames Water of Britain, is leading an $864m greenfield project to provide drinking water to 1.2m people in the city of Izmit, 100km east of Istanbul. In Buenos Aires, Lyonnaise des Eaux , the private French water company, took over the entire network as a concession.
The Buenos Aires privatisation demonstrated how quickly private management can reverse decades of decline. Within months the new operators made 640,000 new connections, while raising both the quality and quantity of the water supply. Wider economic reforms, fiscal stability, sound regulation and strong federal government support were essential to the project's success.
The Izmit project took seven years to negotiate, but broke new ground in financing. It is the largest private water project in the world and the first to be built under Turkey's build-operate-transfer rules. These allow a contractor to build a project and operate it to turn a profit before transferring it to the state. Izmit is to revert to the state 15 years after it begins operation.
Thames put together a consortium of local private contractors, the municipality and two Japanese trading houses which raised debt finance guaranteed by the central government for 85 per cent of the project's cost.
Although the number of water-related privatisations or private management schemes is increasing, they are still small in relation to power or telecoms privatisations and small in relation to the size of the public industry.
However, Bill Alexander, chief executive of Britain's Thames Water, expects highly profitable, if risky, overseas contracts mainly from Asia to provide 10 per cent of his company's earnings by the year 2000.
The IFC 's Mr Duff suggested governments and lenders could limit risk by introducing more guarantees and non-commercial risk insurance. Local authorities, criticised in many countries for inefficiency, excessive interference in their water companies and lax financial discipline, should adopt international accounting methods and submit to gradings by international credit rating agencies.
But this is no substitute for public policy and market-oriented reform, and neither can it substitute putting a market price on water, the most basic reform.
By making water valuable, governments can improve conservation, increase supplies and even make water as glamorous as telecoms and power. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

Quake could cripple insurance industry

Abstract: By Dennis Bueckert The Canadian Press OTTAWA - A serious earthquake in the Vancouver area would be so costly that it would devastate a portion of the Canadian insurance industry, says a study of natural hazards in Canada. A major r earthquake in the Lower Mainland could now cost $30 billion, or one third of the province's annual gross domestic product, says the study prepared by experts from government, industry and academia. "Such an event could cause an economic shock 10 times greaterthan the most recent recession, and less than half of this loss would be covered by insurance," says the report titled Coping With Natural Hazards in Canada. The Insurance Bureau of Canada has estimated that roughly one- quarter of the companies writing property insurance in B.C. would become insolvent following an earthquake in Vancouver, says the report.

Full text: By Dennis Bueckert The Canadian Press OTTAWA - A serious earthquake in the Vancouver area would be so costly that it would devastate a portion of the Canadian insurance industry, says a study of natural hazards in Canada. A major r earthquake in the Lower Mainland could now cost $30 billion, or one third of the province's annual gross domestic product, says the study prepared by experts from government, industry and academia. "Such an event could cause an economic shock 10 times greaterthan the most recent recession, and less than half of this loss would be covered by insurance," says the report titled Coping With Natural Hazards in Canada.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada has estimated that roughly one- quarter of the companies writing property insurance in B.C. would become insolvent following an earthquake in Vancouver, says the report.
These bankruptcies would be felt throughout the Canadian insurance market which might not be able to meet claims from other areas of the country.
"The Canadian insurance industry is at risk, should there be such an event."
The public and private costs of natural disasters have been increasing steadily in Canada and around the world, says the report. A natural disaster is defined as an event that overwhelms the resources of a community.
The study predicts a growing number of natural disasters in coming years due to increased population in regions of high risk, the increased value of property and the effects of climate change.
"The scientific evidence is most consistent for the prediction of more heat waves, more frequent and severe convective storms [which are responsible for thunderstorms, tornadoes and hailstorms], and more frequent floods."
No foreseeable disaster would cause damage comparable to that of an earthquake in an urban area like Vancouver. Much of the damage would likely be caused by post-quake fires.
"The [insurance] industry would face a probably maximum loss of $9 billion to $12 billion," says the study. "The industry's capacity in the province was estimated in 1994 to be $2.3 billion, far short of possible needs."
"A contagion effect could occur if policy holders cancelled policies with companies that they felt might become insolvent, making insolvency a self-fulfilling prophecy for many firms."
People generally have skewed perceptions about the extent to which they are at risk, and are confused about their insurance coverage for quake damage, says the report.
For example, 60 per cent of homeowners in Vancouver buy earthquake insurance while less than five per cent of people in Montreal do so, even though the risks are similar.

Abstract: A serious earthquake in the Vancouver area would be so costly that it would devastate a portion of the Canadian insurance industry, says a study of natural hazards in Canada. The Insurance Bureau of Canada has estimated that roughly one- quarter of the companies writing property insurance in British Columbia would become insolvent following an earthquake in Vancouver, the report says. No foreseeable disaster would cause damage comparable to that of an earthquake in an urban area like Vancouver. Much of the damage would likely be caused by post-quake fires.

Full text: A serious earthquake in the Vancouver area would be so costly that it would devastate a portion of the Canadian insurance industry, says a study of natural hazards in Canada.
A major earthquake in the lower B.C. mainland could now cost $30 billion, or one-third of the province's annual gross domestic product, says the study prepared by experts from government, industry and academia.
"Such an event could cause an economic shock 10 times greater than the most recent recession, and less than half of this loss would be covered by insurance," says the report titled Coping With Natural Hazards in Canada.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada has estimated that roughly one- quarter of the companies writing property insurance in British Columbia would become insolvent following an earthquake in Vancouver, the report says.
These bankruptcies would be felt throughout the Canadian insurance market, which might not be able to meet claims from other areas of the country.
"The Canadian insurance industry is at risk, should there be such an event."
The public and private costs of natural disasters have been increasing steadily in Canada and around the world, the report says.
The study predicts a growing number of natural disasters in coming years because of increased population in regions of high risk, the increased value of property and the effects of climate change.
"The scientific evidence is most consistent for the prediction of more heat waves, more frequent and severe convective storms (which are responsible for thunderstorms, tornadoes and hailstorms), and more frequent floods."
No foreseeable disaster would cause damage comparable to that of an earthquake in an urban area like Vancouver. Much of the damage would likely be caused by post-quake fires.
"The (insurance) industry would face a probably maximum loss of
$9 billion to $12 billion," the study says. "The industry's capacity in the province was estimated in 1994 to be $2.3 billion, far short of possible needs."
"A contagion effect could occur if policyholders cancelled policies with companies that they felt might become insolvent, making insolvency a self-fulfilling prophecy for many firms."
People generally have skewed perceptions about the extent to which they are at risk, and are confused about their insurance coverage for quake damage, the report says.
For example, 60 per cent of homeowners in Vancouver buy earthquake insurance while fewer than five per cent of people in Montreal do so, even though the risks are similar.
Participants in the study included the federal Environment Department, Emergency Preparedness Canada, Insurance Bureau of Canada, the Reinsurance Research Council and the University of Toronto.

Full text: Up in walrus country, unhappy Eskimo hunters say the frozen sea is breaking up early these days. An ocean away, in the balmy mid-Pacific, islanders report the tides are suddenly stealing away chunks of precious land.
Things are going wrong out at the edge of the world, and people there blame global warming. But back in the world's capitals, where 1997 is the year for action on climate change, things are going slowly.
Behind diplomacy's closed doors, negotiators are drafting a treaty to control carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse" emissions, gases many scientists say are warming the planet. Emissaries are to gather in Kyoto, Japan, in December to sign the unprecedented new commitments.
After eons of talking about the weather, mankind may finally be ready to do something about it.
But as the weeks tick down and the debate heats up, the outcome looks less and less certain.
At preliminary sessions in Bonn, Germany, in August, the U.S. delegation once again took no detailed negotiating position. Reduction targets were not discussed. Those who favor decisive action grew discouraged.
"I am not very optimistic about Kyoto," Bert Bolin, a leading atmospheric scientist, said from Stockholm.
The planetary debate pits rich countries against poor, islands against continents, oil producers against conservationists.
It means many things to many people. American negotiator Tim Wirth calls climate change the top "environmental challenge" of our time. But U.S. industrialists describe the treaty negotiations as the century's most important "economic decision."
The environment versus the economy: The fear of damage from a changing climate weighed against the fear of lost business and jobs from energy restraints.
In the end, Kyoto may produce an incomplete agreement, a basis for more talk and small steps forward, a process like the world trade negotiations, which covered almost half a century.
And while diplomats duel, scientists work--atop glaciers, in air-monitoring stations, through satellite launches--to clear up nagging uncertainties still clouding climate change.
There is nothing uncertain about the underlying theory.
In 1898, as industry expanded in Europe and America, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius warned that carbon dioxide pouring into the atmosphere would trap more of the Earth's heat--like the glass of a greenhouse.
Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other gases that trap heat are transparent to incoming sunlight, but absorb the infrared radiation that Earth, maintaining its heat balance, emits back to space.
Fuel combustion--in engines powering everything from automobiles to electric plants--is the biggest man-made source of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Decomposition of organic waste is a major source of methane.
From 1800 to 1994, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere jumped from 280 parts per million to 358. And during the last century, the average global temperature rose by about 1 degree Fahrenheit.
Four of the five hottest years on record have occurred since 1990. Glaciers almost everywhere are in retreat, and oceans--which expand when warmed--have risen by 4 to 10 inches.
Reports arrive from across the globe of unusual seas and weather.
In Alaska, Charlie Johnson, a leader of Eskimo hunters, said the walrus harvest is down the last few years because the Arctic sea ice--the place where man meets walrus--breaks up earlier than usual each spring.
"The people in the villages and everybody else feels the ice is leaving earlier," Johnson said by telephone from Nome.
On the remote Pacific atoll of Nukuoro, in the Federated States of Micronesia, a rising sea has flooded the few acres where islanders can grow taro, their staple crop.
"If something's not done, Nukuoro is going to be abandoned," said John Mooteb, a Micronesia government official.
The sea can rise or fall for various reasons, oceanographers note. In the same cautious vein, scientists have long shied from flatly attributing the warming of recent decades to gas emissions. But in 1995 they crossed a threshold.
A U.N. report, produced with the help of more than 2,000 specialists worldwide, concluded that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human impact on Earth's climate system."
The scientific panel, led by Bolin, the Swedish climatologist, predicted emissions at current rates would raise global temperatures by an additional 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 and sea levels by 6 inches to 3 feet, inundating islands and shorelines.
Weather would grow more turbulent and climate zones might shift hundreds of miles toward the poles, abruptly making regions wetter, drier, warmer or colder.
Some areas might benefit--from crop-nurturing rains, for example. But climate surprises could be devastating: Mosquitoes might bring malaria to new areas, for example, or the northern permafrost might soften, buckling roads and buildings.
Skeptics remain. Some say the link to greenhouse gases still is not shown beyond doubt. Some note the consensus projections have broad margins of error.
"The signal of warming is gradually getting stronger," said David A. Randall at Colorado State University, who is editor of the Journal of Climate. But although the last century's warming "is definitely very strong . . . one century isn't a long time in this field."
One doubter, University of Virginia climatologist Pat Michaels, acknowledges that man has affected the climate. "My point," he said, "is not whether human beings change the climate, but how much and how."
The mainstream majority supporting the U.N. report concedes that big questions remain.
For one thing, a warmer world will evaporate water more rapidly, forming more clouds in the atmosphere. Depending on how and where they form, they may either cool or further warm the surface.
Another question: Will the oceans, absorbing enough warmth quickly enough, hold down rising air temperatures?
Answers would make projections more precise. But answers may not come until after the world begins feeling the worst effects of warming.
"Despite the uncertainty, the risk of a significant change of climate does not go away," Bolin said. He said political leaders must act on "risk analysis."
In 1992, they acted by postponing. A 165-nation treaty on climate change called for voluntary emissions cutbacks. That failed, and in 1995 governments agreed to toughen the treaty by negotiating mandatory rollbacks by industrial nations.
Island states proposed that by 2005, emissions be cut by 20% below 1990 levels. The European Union favors a 15% reduction by 2010.
Such proposals don't prescribe how to do it, but studies suggest a range of ways: switching from coal and oil to nuclear or solar energy; developing more fuel-efficient engines; ending subsidies and imposing heavier taxes on carbon fuels; saving forests, which consume carbon dioxide.
President Clinton has pledged a "strong American commitment to realistic and binding limits." But the United States, responsible for one-quarter of global emissions, has yet to commit to specific targets and timetables.
American business lobbyists contend that emissions reductions could wipe out hundreds of thousands of jobs in the coal, oil, chemical and other industries--in part because companies would move operations to developing countries. And the U.S. Senate declared, by a 95 to 0 vote, that it will not ratify a treaty that does not also require emission cutbacks in the developing world.
Behind the scenes, the Clinton administration is readying a proposal expected to bring developing countries under the treaty in some new way and to introduce emissions-quota "trading" and other devices making compliance more flexible.
To build U.S. public support, Clinton has scheduled a White House conference on climate change for early October. But the slow movement in Washington still worries others.
"We should take care that what the U.S. Congress has proposed is not going to stalemate the rest of the negotiations," said Robert Wester, a spokesman for the Dutch Environment Ministry.
Washington is not alone. Japan, Australia and some other nations, under pressure from local industry, also are reluctant partners in the talks, whose complexity is producing unlikely alliances.
British Petroleum, for example, a big player in solar energy, has broken ranks with other oil producers to stand with environmentalists. And insurance companies, fearing mounting damage claims from higher sea levels, floods, storms and other severe weather, support quick action against climate change.
"A lot is going on behind the business lobbying," said Michael Zammit Cutajar, the Maltese official who is executive secretary for the negotiations.
With the treaty in mind, industry is working hard on energy-saving technologies, he said. "Those who get there first with a low-emission car engine, for example, stand to make a lot of money."
He believes Kyoto may produce an immediate accord on cutback targets--most think no more than 10%--and agreement in principle in other areas. Those might include coverage of developing countries and market-based compliance systems.
Then the talks would continue, round for round, like the long-running trade negotiations, Zammit Cutajar said.
"Kyoto is another step on a long road."

Abstract: John Browne "is not a prophet, just a rational man," says a colleague of the chief executive of British Petroleum who has taken a lead in accepting climate change as a threat to his industry. Indeed, Mr Browne seems approachably ordinary in asking a journalist to help him move a sofa at the start of an interview. But in spite of making statements that are ground-breaking for an oil chief, Mr Browne is keen to reject the label of "green maverick" applied by some commentators to his company.

Full text: John Browne "is not a prophet, just a rational man," says a colleague of the chief executive of British Petroleum who has taken a lead in accepting climate change as a threat to his industry.
Indeed, Mr Browne seems approachably ordinary in asking a journalist to help him move a sofa at the start of an interview.
He then sets out his view - ahead of a speech to German parliamentarians next Tuesday - on the need for "continuous steps" to tackle climate change, one cause of which may be fossil fuel consumption.
Most of his industry peers prefer to cite the scientific uncertainty still surrounding climate change as a reason for inaction.
"There could be a conclusion in 20 years' time that none of that [what society did] made any difference," says Mr Browne. "One might equally say that one did not do enough."
But in spite of making statements that are ground-breaking for an oil chief, Mr Browne is keen to reject the label of "green maverick" applied by some commentators to his company.
"The words are very bad for business," says Mr Browne. "We talk about health, safety, and environment before we talk about financial performance and operating performance."
With much of its business done in joint ventures, BP knows it has a "lot in common with other oil companies on how we do things on the ground" and that includes minimising damage to the environment.
Having said that, Mr Browne concedes that "not all oil companies are the same". BP has spent more money than other oil companies to build market share in emerging solar energy technology for example.
He says that the $160m (£99m) spent by BP on developing its solar energy business "over the past medium-term" is neither "chicken feed" nor "tinkering". The group, which had turnover of about $70bn last year, aims to take solar panel sales to $1bn over the next decade from $100m now.
"We happen to believe that solar will grow," says Mr Browne. "Our position is that the energy mix in 50 years will . . . beradically different from today."
Although demand for oil and gas will also continue to expand, Mr Browne has some practical advice for governments seeking to agree "precautionary" action to curb climate change gases at international negotiations in Kyoto this December.
Mr Browne points out that governments should aim for "low hanging fruit" rather than agree unpopular discriminatory taxes on one group of society, say motorists, which will fail.
He is calling for an evenly distributed tax on energy waste and is backing plans on the table at Kyoto to enable developed countries to transfer energy-efficient technology to developing countries.
Despite a recent dinner with Lord Melchett, the executive director of Greenpeace, after its activists scaled BP oil installations in the Atlantic this summer, Mr Browne says he is not trying to please environmentalist groups.
But he makes no secret of the fact that the company's goal is to be at one with "our customers" in a fiercely competitive retail market.
Most fund managers say the environment is only one of several issues on which they judge the company. But one institutional investor was sufficiently impressed by BP's handling of this summer's protests by Greenpeace to contrast it favourably with Shell .
The investor was referring to Shell's response to protests against its attempts to dump the Brent Spar oil rig at sea two years ago .
The investor declined to be identified but his sentiments were shared by Carlos Joly, vice-president of Storebrand , the Norwegian insurance company, which has set up a fund to invest in companies that minimise harm to the environment. "All other things being equal, I would choose to invest in BP rather than Shell," says Mr Joly. For the moment, however, Storebrand is awaiting more information from Shell and BP.
This leads to another reason for BP's reluctance to explicitly proclaim its "green" virtue. This is to avoid accusations of hypocrisy lobbed at companies which wear concern for the environment or ethics on their sleeve.
ITV television showed a documentary renewing allegations of BP's double standards in Colombia this week.
But while rejecting most of the criticisms as "not new", Mr Browne says the company is pursuing continuous improvement in this area like any other. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: Canada is in for more floods along with prolonged droughts, frequent tornadoes, severe heat waves and fewer deep freezes, the country's environment ministers were told yesterday. A lone insurance company executive delivered the bad news to them, including new federal Environment Minister Christine Stewart attending her first meeting of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. ``On the climate change front we are seeing tremendous changes in the frequency and severity of extreme weather activity in Canada,'' Sorema Management president Angus Ross told the closed-door meeting in Toronto, according to a copy of his presentation obtained by The Star.

Full text:   Canada is in for more floods along with prolonged droughts, frequent tornadoes, severe heat waves and fewer deep freezes, the country's environment ministers were told yesterday.
But it wasn't just government scientists giving that message to a ministers' ``learning session'' in Toronto on the anticipated effects of global warming that is projected to reach its peak by 2050.
A lone insurance company executive delivered the bad news to them, including new federal Environment Minister Christine Stewart attending her first meeting of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment.
``On the climate change front we are seeing tremendous changes in the frequency and severity of extreme weather activity in Canada,'' Sorema Management president Angus Ross told the closed-door meeting in Toronto, according to a copy of his presentation obtained by The Star.
The insurance industry is taking a lead in ringing alarm bells over the potential disastrous impact of climate change if massive reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are not achieved.
Ross provided the meeting with a list of seven large insurance and reinsurance companies put out of business because of huge claims based on an increasing number of natural disasters world-wide.
``All ran into financial difficulties because of environmental claims or major weather losses and I could add another 200 or so (companies) to this list,'' Ross said.
Insurance companies believe increasing claims from natural disasters are caused by the influence of global warming that is projected to reach a peak of climate-related disasters by 2050 when carbon dioxide greenhouse gas is expected to be double its current level in the atmosphere.
The day-long meeting was to prepare the ministers for a November meeting with their energy ministry counterparts to put the final touches on the position Canada will take at negotiations in Kyoto, Japan, in December for a new international treaty on climate change.
``I hope they develop enough of a spine to stand up to the energy ministers,'' said the Sierra Club's Louise Comeau, a leading environmental activists on climate change.
Energy interests traditionally take priority over environmental protection in Canada, Comeau said.
Norm Sterling, who serves as Ontario's environment and energy minister, agreed with the environmentalists that energy interests hold the upper hand.
Sterling said he fears the November meeting of ministers will be too late to make any effective changes in the negotiating strategy the federal government will take to Kyoto.
``The federal minister realizes it's the provincial governments that have to get these reductions made,'' Sterling said. ``They have to think about how this will be fairly shared among the partners in Canada.''
Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that trap heat in the atmosphere, raising the over-all temperature of the planet, are created by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.
Following the Earth Summit in Rio di Janeiro five years ago, Canada was among the nations that agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
But Canada and most other developed countries won't meet that goal and the Kyoto meetings could see a 10-year extension on meeting the reduced emission levels, Comeau said.
Reducing emissions cannot be accomplished without a major shift away from the use of fossil fuels, said Greenpeace climate change campaigner Kevin Jardine.

Full text: Editor's note: For months, the world's nations have been negotiating a treaty to cut back, for the first time, on global fuel emissions. The reason: the looming reality of climate change.
Up in walrus country, Eskimo hunters say the frozen sea is breaking up early these days. An ocean away, in the balmy mid-Pacific, islanders report the tides suddenly are stealing away chunks of precious land.
Things are going wrong at the edge of the world, and people there blame global warming. But back in the world's capitals, where 1997 is the year for action on climate change, things are going slowly.
Behind diplomacy's closed doors, negotiators are drafting a treaty to control carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse" emissions, gases which many scientists say are warming the planet. Emissaries are to gather in Kyoto, Japan, in December to sign the unprecedented commitments.
After eons of talking about the weather, humankind may finally be on the verge of doing something about it.
As the weeks tick down and the debate heats up, however, the outcome appears less and less certain.
At preliminary sessions in Bonn last month, the U.S. delegation once again took no detailed negotiating position. Reduction targets were not discussed. Those who favor decisive action grew discouraged.
"I am not very optimistic about Kyoto," said Bert Bolin, a leading atmospheric scientist, in a telephone interview from Stockholm.
The planetary debate pits rich countries against poor, islands against continents, oil producers against conservationists.
It means many things to many people. American negotiator Tim Wirth calls climate change the top "environmental challenge" of our time. But U.S. industrialists describe the treaty negotiations as the century's most important "economic decision."
The environment vs. the economy: The fear of damage from a changing climate weighed against the fear of lost business and jobs from energy restraints.
In the end, Kyoto may produce an incomplete agreement, a basis for more talk and small steps forward, a process like the world trade negotiations, which covered almost a half-century.
While diplomats duel, scientists work--atop glaciers, in air-monitoring stations, through satellite launches--to clear up nagging uncertainties still clouding climate change.
There is nothing uncertain about the underlying theory.
In 1898, as industry expanded in Europe and America, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius warned that carbon dioxide pouring into the atmosphere would trap more of the Earth's heat--like the glass of a greenhouse.
Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other gases that trap heat are transparent to incoming sunlight, but absorb the infrared radiation that Earth, maintaining its heat balance, emits back to space.
Fuel combustion--in engines powering everything from automobiles to electricity plants--is the biggest man-made source of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Decomposition of organic waste is a major source of methane.
From 1800 to 1994, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere jumped from 280 parts per million to 358. And during the past century, the average global temperature rose by about 1 degree Fahrenheit.
Four of the five hottest years on record have occurred since 1990. Glaciers almost everywhere are in retreat, and oceans--which expand when warmed--have risen by 4 to 10 inches.
Reports arrive from across the globe of unusual seas and weather.
In Alaska, Charlie Johnson, a leader of Eskimo hunters, said the walrus harvest is down the past few years because the Arctic sea ice--the place where man meets walrus--breaks up earlier than usual each spring.
"The people in the villages and everybody else feels the ice is leaving earlier," Johnson said from Nome.
On the remote Pacific atoll of Nukuoro, in the Federated States of Micronesia, a rising sea has flooded the few acres where islanders can grow taro, their staple crop.
"If something's not done, Nukuoro is going to be abandoned," said John Mooteb, a Micronesia government official.
The sea can rise or fall for various reasons, oceanographers note. In the same cautious vein, scientists have long shied from flatly attributing the warming of recent decades to gas emissions. But in 1995 they crossed a threshold.
A UN report, produced with the help of more than 2,000 specialists worldwide, concluded that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human impact on Earth's climate system."
The scientific panel, led by Bolin, the Swedish climatologist, predicted emissions at current rates would raise global temperatures by an additional 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 and sea levels by 6 inches to 3 feet, inundating islands and shorelines.
Weather would grow more turbulent, and climate zones might shift hundreds of miles toward the poles, abruptly making regions wetter, drier, warmer or colder.
Some skeptics remain. Some say the link to greenhouse gases still is not shown beyond doubt. Some note the consensus projections have broad margins of error.
"The signal of warming is gradually getting stronger," said David A. Randall at Colorado State University, who is editor of the Journal of Climate. But although the past century's warming "is definitely very strong. . . one century isn't a long time in this field."
One doubter, University of Virginia climatologist Pat Michaels, acknowledges man has affected the climate. "My point," he said, "is not whether human beings change the climate, but how much and how."
The mainstream majority supporting the UN report concedes that big questions remain.
For one thing, a warmer world will evaporate water more rapidly, forming more clouds in the atmosphere. Depending on how and where they form, they may either cool or further warm the surface.
Another question: Will the oceans, absorbing enough warmth quickly enough, hold down rising air temperatures?
Answers would make projections more precise. But answers may not come until after the world begins feeling the strongest effects of warming.
"Despite the uncertainty, the risk of a significant change of climate does not go away," Bolin said. He said political leaders must act on "risk analysis."
In 1992, they acted by postponing. A 165-nation treaty on climate change called for voluntary emissions cutbacks. That failed and in 1995 governments agreed to toughen the treaty by negotiating mandatory rollbacks by industrial nations.
President Clinton has pledged a "strong American commitment to realistic and binding limits." But the United States, responsible for one-quarter of global emissions, has yet to commit to specific targets and timetables.
American business lobbyists contend emissions reductions could wipe out hundreds of thousands of jobs in the coal, oil, chemical and other industries--in part because companies would move operations to developing countries. And the U.S. Senate declared, by a 95-0 vote, it won't ratify a treaty that doesn't also require emission cutbacks in the developing world.
Washington is not alone. Japan, Australia and some other nations, under pressure from local industry, also are reluctant partners in the talks, whose complexity is producing unlikely alliances.
British Petroleum, for example, a big player in solar energy, has broken ranks with other oil producers to stand with environmentalists. Insurance companies, fearing mounting damage claims from higher sea levels, floods, storms and other severe weather, support quick action against climate change.
"A lot is going on behind the business lobbying," said Michael Zammit Cutajar, the Maltese official who is executive secretary for the negotiations.
With the treaty in mind, industry is working hard on energy-saving technologies, he said. "Those who get there first with a low-emission car engine, for example, stand to make a lot of money."
He believes Kyoto may produce an immediate accord on cutback targets--most think no more than 10 percent--and agreement in principle in other areas.
Then the talks would continue, round for round, like the long-running trade negotiations, Zammit Cutajar said.
"Kyoto is another step on a long road."

Island states proposed that by 2005, emissions be cut by 20 percent below 1990 levels. The European Union favors a 15 percent reduction by 2010.
Such proposals don't prescribe how to do it, but studies suggest a range of ways: switching from coal and oil to nuclear or solar energy; developing more fuel-efficient engines; ending subsidies and imposing heavier taxes on carbon fuels; saving forests, which consume carbon dioxide.
President Clinton has pledged a ``strong American commitment to realistic and binding limits.'' But the United States, responsible for one-quarter of global emissions, has yet to commit to specific targets and timetables.
American business lobbyists contend emissions reductions could wipe out hundreds of thousands of jobs in the coal, oil, chemical and other industries -- in part because companies would move operations to developing countries. And the U.S. Senate declared, by a 95-0 vote, it will not ratify a treaty that does not also require emission cutbacks in the developing world.
Behind the scenes, the Clinton administration is readying a proposal expected to bring developing countries under the treaty in some new way and to introduce emissions-quota ``trading'' and other devices making compliance more flexible.
Washington is not alone. Japan, Australia and some other nations, under pressure from local industry, also are reluctant partners in the talks, whose complexity is producing unlikely alliances.
British Petroleum, for example, a big player in solar energy, has broken ranks with other oil producers to stand with environmentalists.

Explosion of interest Academics may identify a natural disaster waiting to happen, but how can they prevent the tragic effects? Tim Radford on the new money in hazard warning

Abstract: `Within UCL, we had people working on natural hazards within about 10 different departments. We wanted funding to pull this research together. The obvious people to look to were the insurance and reinsurance industries. We had a very positive response all round. Within a year, the reinsurance broker Greig Fester came up with the funding for my position. They also provide us with a number of projects each year.' For instance, Dr Mark Saunders, from the UCL's department of space and climate physics, has been working on a new predictor for numbers of hurricanes. `What he has discovered is the warmer the sea in the Atlantic, the more hurricanes,' Prof Maguire says. `With 27C sea surface temperatures, you have two hurricanes a year. If you go up to 28C, you are talking something like seven. Greig Fester were incredibly interested in that, and they funded a PhD student to work on this for the next three years.' The centre is reporting on the short- and long-term impact of the Central European floods in July, which ruined homes, shut down factories and destroyed farmland by depositing layers of contaminants and raw sewage on to fields that should have been laden with crops. `In most areas, only one in three people were insured,' says (Bill) McGuire. `The water was incredibly deep. People were being flooded out of the upper floors of their houses.' The volcanic eruption in Montserrat has been an uncomfortable lesson. Vulcanologists would like to develop better warning machinery, not so much for Montserrat - two years of eruption have already done appalling damage - but for other islands in the same Caribbean arc: Dominica, St Vincent, Guadeloupe and others.

Full text: For some dons, disaster is a way of life; for others, it can be anything but. Twelve vulcanologists - one of them Geoff Brown, of the Open University - have perished since 1991. Yet that hasn't stopped the pursuit of knowledge vital to our understanding of natural disasters.
The insurance industry - which has had to deal with awesome losses this decade because of US hurricanes and the earthquakes in Los Angeles and Kobe, Japan - takes hazard seriously. It has also been looking with alarm at the spectre of climate change. `They have an enormous amount to lose if they don't get things right,' says Professor Bill McGuire, director of a new unit called the Greig Fester Centre for Hazard Research, at University College, London. `They want to know the risks in a changing planet.
`Within UCL, we had people working on natural hazards within about 10 different departments. We wanted funding to pull this research together. The obvious people to look to were the insurance and reinsurance industries. We had a very positive response all round. Within a year, the reinsurance broker Greig Fester came up with the funding for my position. They also provide us with a number of projects each year.' For instance, Dr Mark Saunders, from the UCL's department of space and climate physics, has been working on a new predictor for numbers of hurricanes. `What he has discovered is the warmer the sea in the Atlantic, the more hurricanes,' Prof Maguire says. `With 27C sea surface temperatures, you have two hurricanes a year. If you go up to 28C, you are talking something like seven. Greig Fester were incredibly interested in that, and they funded a PhD student to work on this for the next three years.' The centre is reporting on the short- and long-term impact of the Central European floods in July, which ruined homes, shut down factories and destroyed farmland by depositing layers of contaminants and raw sewage on to fields that should have been laden with crops. `In most areas, only one in three people were insured,' says McGuire. `The water was incredibly deep. People were being flooded out of the upper floors of their houses.' The volcanic eruption in Montserrat has been an uncomfortable lesson. Vulcanologists would like to develop better warning machinery, not so much for Montserrat - two years of eruption have already done appalling damage - but for other islands in the same Caribbean arc: Dominica, St Vincent, Guadeloupe and others.
`They all have explosive volcanoes,' Prof Maguire says. `Some are more explosive than Montserrat and, potentially, they could cause very big problems. But the real problem is getting people educated, getting authorities trained, getting plans in place before the volcano becomes active, so that they know what to do when things get started.
`Montserrat is a case in question. We had seismic activity under the volcano in the latter part of the last century, and in the 1930s and in the 1960s - every 30 years. In the '80s, a hazard report was written for the volcano, saying keep an eye on it in the '80s. Nothing whatsoever was done about that report. It vanished somewhere. But plans for disaster mitigation should have been put in place at that time.' The UCL centre is unique - but not alone. York University has a Postwar Reconstruction and Development Unit, which is concerned with one kind of human tragedy; Cranfield Institute of Technology runs a Disaster Preparedness Centre; Oxford Brookes University has a Centre for Emergency and Development Planning.
Dr Ian Davis, of the Oxford Centre for Disaster Studies, is linked to all of them - and he believes things can be done. He takes heart from the Philippines, which has been hit by floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons and a calamitious eruption of Mt Pinatubo.
`A whole disaster culture seems to have developed in the Philippines because of the frequency of cyclones and floods,' he says. `Each of these different events seems to reinforce the others, and the people there know what to do. They have developed a culture of preparedness.
`Another good example is in India, where the evacuations before cyclones are really becoming very effective indeed. They are evacuating enormous numbers of people - up to 700,000 in one event.' The '90s are supposed to be, everywhere, concerned with disaster. The UN declared this the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. Every year, early in October, nations have celebrated an IDNDR day. In Britain, disaster day has had about as much impact as Flea Awareness Week.
But since 1990, a committee of British academics, meteorologists, seismologists and engineers has been working on practical ways to save life in potential disasters. They are looking at ways to spread warnings of calamitous storms around tiny islands in the Indian ocean, for example, or ways of preparing for droughts in central Africa.
This year, the scientists are taking a bloodcurdling message to schools: on October 8, there will be afternoon conferences for fifth- and sixth-formers in London, Cardiff, Manchester, Glasgow and Belfast. Prof Maguire says: `There are two aspects. There is the scientific aspect, where you improve methodologies and techniques for forecasting and predicting. These things are going on all the time, developing better science. And the second thing you need to do is to have your scientific instrumentation where it is needed. There could be 1,000 active volcanoes in the world, yet we are looking at only 120.' Yet it doesn't matter how good the science is, he says, if you can't get the message across to the civil authorities and the public. So academics still have an education problem: to teach people and reach people.
The classic case was an eruption of Nevada del Ruiz, in Colombia, which triggered a catastrophic mudslide. `There shouldn't have been anybody killed there,' Prof Maguire insists. `The warnings were given, people had plenty of time to get out, yet nearly 25,000 died. I would say raising awareness during the decade has been at least as important as scientific methodology.'

Abstract: WHAT A PRETTY VIEW THIS IS. A STRETCH OF GRASS, A FRINGE OF Queen Anne's lace, then sand followed by white, bouncing waves at the turbulent edge of a wide expanse of the restless Atlantic, stretching eastward to the horizon.

Abstract: Environment Minister Christine Stewart is about to launch a massive education campaign to make Canadians aware of the impending danger of global warming. The program, which officially begins later this month, is built around six Environment Canada reports that detail the current and future effects of global warming on each region of the country. Stewart said Canadians must be prepared for the ``dramatic measures'' required to halt global warming, the same way they came to understand and embrace the need for deficit reduction.

Full text:   Environment Minister Christine Stewart is about to launch a massive education campaign to make Canadians aware of the impending danger of global warming.
The program, which officially begins later this month, is built around six Environment Canada reports that detail the current and future effects of global warming on each region of the country.
It will culminate in a national report to be released in November, on the eve of an international conference that's to establish a binding greenhouse gas emissions treaty.
Targets set at the Kyoto Conference in December could require a massive restructuring of the energy-intensive Canadian economy, which is the second largest per-capita source of greenhouse gases in the world.
Only the United States on a per-capita basis produces more of the emissions that cause global warming.
Stewart said Canadians must be prepared for the ``dramatic measures'' required to halt global warming, the same way they came to understand and embrace the need for deficit reduction.
``One of my priorities is to help the Canadian public understand the issue and make sure they have the information and knowledge they need to be supportive of the measures that have to be taken,'' she said.
In the United States, President Bill Clinton has launched a similar public information campaign.
He recently invited the top U.S. scientists to a White House symposium on global warming; another national forum is scheduled for October.
Internationally, the issue is the subject of fierce debate. Insurance companies, hard hit by rising claims from storms, floods and other natural disasters, want a greatly improved global treaty.
Lined up against them are the fossil fuel and automotive industries that could face costly new restrictions under tough emissions targets.
The European Union has called for a 15-per-cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010.
Small island states in the Caribbean and South Pacific, threatened with rising sea levels that could wipe out entire countries, want a 20-per-cent cut by 2005.
Canada has yet to endorse any target or range of targets. Prime Minister Jean Chretien has said only that Canada will agree to ``binding, realistic and enforceable'' goals for gas emissions.
Greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane -- accumulate in the planet's atmosphere, trapping heat that should escape into outer space.
The vast majority of greenhouse gases come from the use of fossil fuels -- oil, coal and gas -- in factories, vehicles and generating plants.
The greenhouse effect has already raised the earth's average temperature and scientists predict it will climb gradually by one to 3.5 degrees by 2100.
Canada, as a northern country, is particularly vulnerable to climate change. New projections from Environment Canada suggest that central and northern Canada will warm four to six degrees by 2050, decreasing to three to four degrees along eastern and western coastlines.
Climate models suggest such a rise will have serious effects on regional weather patterns, forests, fisheries and agriculture.
The prairies will experience more droughts, the north more forest fires and the entire country more severe storms.
Stewart, appointed in June as environment minister, is determined to make global warming a central focus of federal policy-making.
But to do so, she'll have to convince key cabinet colleagues, such as Finance Minister Paul Martin, Industry Minister John Manley and Natural Resource Minister Ralph Goodale, that global warming poses a real threat to Canada's environment and economy.
``If we don't deal with the climate change issue, which international science now says is due in large part to human activities, we won't need to worry about smog or toxics or endangered species because there won't be any left,'' Stewart said.
``Some Canadians say there could be benefits from climate change, that our cold winters will get warmer, but there's a really serious downside to that as well,'' she said.
Those negatives will be explored in six reports that examine how global warming will affect Canada.
The reports will comprise 3,500 pages of scientific research conducted since 1990.
- The issue: Public awareness of impact of global warming.
- What's new: Six federal reports detail and forecast effects of warming trends.
- What's next: Complete report will be released in November.

Anxious eyes on the climate
Reinsurers are keeping a weather eye on the problem of rising temperatures
WHY should global warming be of any interest to reinsurers? The simple answer is that it could cost them a lot of money. The more complex and interesting answer is that it could change the way the industry thinks about risk, and therefore the part insurance plays in economic life.
Ivo Knoepfel, climate and environment adviser to Swiss Re , one of the world's biggest reinsurers, said: "We are convinced that global warming is a serious issue. We reckon that the loss burden due to natural catastrophes will increase because of climate changes and other factors."
The question is what to do about it. There is little dispute now that global warming - defined as a rise in the temperature of the atmosphere - is occurring. It is also widely, although not universally, accepted that the frequency of severe weather, such as storms and hurricanes, has increased over the past 20 years or so.
The industry is painfully aware that Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the Mississippi floods of 1993 and the eastern European floods of this year caused damage amounting to billions of dollars. What is disputed, however, is why our atmosphere is getting warmer and whether that change is related to apparently more common violent and costly weather.
Global warming may be part of a natural long-term trend. But it is also highly likely to be caused in some part by the build-up in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other gases from the burning of fossil fuels. The original calculations on the effect of greenhouse gas emissions were done by the Swedish scientist Svante August Arrhenius more than a century ago.
More recent calculations by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimate that human activity will raise global temperatures faster than at any time in the past 10,000 years - perhaps by 0.3 degrees centigrade a decade. The impact of this increase on climate could be dramatic.
Temperatures are expected to go up more in the northern than in the southern hemisphere, precipitation will increase generally and the incidence of heavy precipitation will also grow. Sea levels will rise, perhaps by as much as 65 centimetres by the end of the next century.
Oliver Peterken, director of research and development for reinsurance brokers Willis Faber & Dumas , says: "The implications are very profound. If climate is changing radically, and perhaps very quickly, how can risks be assessed and priced? Will insurers be forced to withdraw or sharply reduce cover? If that happens, who will pay for damage? How will society allocate the costs? What might the implications be for life and economic activity in regions considered to be high risk? Might entire vulnerable cities such as Miami even have to be abandoned?"
The core of the issue is that insurance is essentially a local undertaking. What matters is not general climate change but the consequences for a specific place at a specific time. As Michael Waceck, managing director of St Paul Reinsurance , part of The St Paul Cos , the American insurance group, said: "It's going to be local weather which is most important for us."
This detailed application of the global warming problem is compounded by another phenomenon. Recent years have seen a rapid growth in population and economic activity in the coastal and sub-tropical areas thought to be most vulnerable to the consequences of climate change: Florida and the coastal US, some of the fast-emerging Asian economies.
Put another way, the cost of disaster is mounting. This has prompted Swiss Re to talk of prosperity loss. "We are no longer contemplating temporary damage to individual properties or businesses but long-term or even permanent damage to whole economic sub-systems, or in the case of small countries possibly entire national economies."
The City of London, for example, is in a low-lying area which might become even more prone to floods from a combination of higher rainfall, rising sea levels, and the separate sinking of eastern England. Will the Thames Barrier be an adequate defence in such relatively severe conditions which were not anticipated when it was built? The same question could be asked of protection against avalanches in the Alps, or tropical storms in Australia, or flooding in Bangladesh.
Unfortunately, nobody knows the answer. It is virtually impossible in the existing very limited state of knowledge about global warming and the climate system to foresee all the implications for the insurance industry. Mr Knoepfel says: "If underlying climatic conditions change, it will become impossible to use past claims experience to quantify natural hazards."
Reinsurance companies suffer a further disadvantage. They are removed from the risks that they ultimately carry. One way in which they have sought to compensate for their lack of first-hand information about risks is to spread their reinsurance portfolio around the world. The assumption, drawn from experience, was that disasters did not happen everywhere at once. But what if we are experiencing a systemic change in climate which renders that assumption invalid?
Not everyone believes that the picture is hopelessly gloomy. Mr Waceck argues that a great deal will depend on government, particularly local authorities, to enforce planning regulations - say for the construction and siting of buildings - designed to reduce potential damage. At the same time, most contracts are negotiated annually. The industry is therefore able to adjust its pricing in frequent steps to take account of events.
That, however, begs the question of whether government and society face up to the implications of global warming. One of the most important lines of defence being erected by reinsurers is to stimulate public discussion. Since information firmly grounded in science is the key to informed debate on global warming, reinsurers have started to back research into the subject - with at least one eye on gaining an advantage over rival companies.
A related instance is the Tsunami Project, from the Japanese word for a tidal wave caused by an earthquake. The project is a joint venture between the Department of Trade and Industry and a group of British insurance companies to finance research into natural disasters. The idea is to give the British insurance industry a competitive edge.
Better information will enable reinsurers to judge the economic rate for risk - the prime contribution the industry makes to economic activity. It might, for example, lead to higher deductibles in exposed areas or to improved protection against natural hazards. But it will be a slow process. In the end, the best weapon in the reinsurance industry's armoury to combat global warming is its flexibility. "I think our industry has the tools to cope with change. That's our business," Mr Knoepfel said. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

The program, which officially begins later this month, is built around six Environment Canada reports that detail the current and future effects of global warming on each region of the country.

In the U.S., President Bill Clinton has launched a similar public-information campaign. Clinton, who became a convert to the issue through the repeated lectures of Vice-President Al Gore, recently invited the nation's top scientists to a White House symposium on global warming; another national forum is scheduled for October.

Those negatives will be explored in six reports that examine how global warming will affect the Pacific and Yukon, Prairie and Northern Canada, Ontario, Quebec, Atlantic Canada and the Arctic. The reports will comprise 3,500 pages of scientific research conducted since 1990.
In mid-month, Stewart is scheduled to meet with the country's environment ministers in Toronto, where she'll attempt to build support for a national emissions- reduction scheme.
``I would like to see us come to a consensus about the urgency and the fact that we all have to take part, that it's in the best interests of all of us to take a national approach,'' Stewart said.
At the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, Canada agreed to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. Ottawa established a voluntary industry-reductions program, but it hasn't come close to meeting the Rio target. Canada's emissions in 1995 were 9.2 per cent above 1990 levels and they're projected to increase substantially in the next century.

The vast majority of greenhouse gases come from the use of fossil fuels -- oil, coal and gas -- in factories, vehicles and generating plants.

The program, which officially begins later this month, is built around six Environment Canada reports that detail the current and future effects of global warming on each region of the country.
It will culminate in a national report to be released in November, on the eve of an international conference that's to establish a binding greenhouse gas emissions treaty.
Targets set at the Kyoto Conference in December could require a massive restructuring of the energy-intensive Canadian economy, which is the second largest per-capita source of greenhouse gases in the world.
Only the United States on a per-capita basis produces more of the emissions that cause global warming.
Canadians must be prepared for the "dramatic measures" required to halt global warming, the same way they came to understand and embrace the need for deficit reduction, Stewart said.
"One of my priorities is to help the Canadian public understand the issue and make sure they have the information and knowledge they need to be supportive of the measures that have to be taken," she said in an interview.
Internationally, the issue is the subject of fierce debate. Insurance companies, hard hit by rising claims from storms, floods and other natural disasters, want a greatly improved global treaty. Lined up against them are the fossil fuel and automotive industries which could face costly new restrictions under tough emissions targets.
The European Union has called for a 15-per-cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. Small island states in the Caribbean and South Pacific, threatened with rising sea levels that could wipe out whole nations, want a 20-per-cent cut by 2005.
Canada has yet to endorse any target or range of targets. Prime Minister Jean Chretien has said only that Canada will agree to "binding, realistic and enforceable" goals for gas emissions.

At the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, Canada agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000.
Ottawa established a voluntary industry reductions program, but it hasn't come close to meeting the Rio target. Canada's emissions in 1995 were 9.2 per cent above 1990 levels and they're projected to increase substantially in the next century.

Full text: Environment Minister Christine Stewart is about to launch a massive education campaign to make Canadians aware of the impending danger of global warming.
The program, which officially begins later this month, is built around six Environment Canada reports that detail the current and future effects of global warming on each region of the country.
It will culminate in a national report to be released in November, on the eve of an international conference that's to establish a binding greenhouse gas emissions treaty.
Targets set at the Kyoto Conference in December could require a massive restructuring of the energy-intensive Canadian economy, which is the second largest per-capita source of greenhouse gases in the world.
Only the United States on a per-capita basis produces more of the emissions that cause global warming.
Stewart said Canadians must be prepared for the "dramatic measures" required to halt global warming, the same way they came to understand and embrace the need for deficit reduction.
Public understanding
"One of my priorities is to help the Canadian public understand the issue and make sure they have the information and knowledge they need to be supportive of the measures that have to be taken," she said in an interview.
In the U.S., President Bill Clinton has launched a similar public information campaign. Clinton, who became a convert to the issue through the repeated lectures of Vice-President Al Gore, recently invited the nation's top scientists to a White House symposium on global warming; another national forum is scheduled for October.
Internationally, the issue is the subject of fierce debate. Insurance companies, hard hit by rising claims from storms, floods and other natural disasters, want a greatly improved global treaty. Lined up against them are the fossil fuel and automotive industries which could face costly new restrictions under tough emissions targets.
The European Union has called for a 15-per-cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010.
Small island states in the Caribbean and South Pacific, threatened with rising sea levels that could wipe out whole nations, want a 20-per-cent cut by 2005.
Canada has yet to endorse any target or range of targets. Prime Minister Jean Chretien has said only that Canada will agree to "binding, realistic and enforceable" goals for gas emissions.
Fossil fuels
Greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane -- accumulate in the planet's atmosphere, trapping heat that should escape into outer space. The vast majority of greenhouse gases come from the use of fossil fuels -- oil, coal and gas -- in factories, vehicles and generating plants.
The greenhouse effect has already raised the earth's average temperature and scientists predict it will climb gradually by one to 3.5 degrees by 2100.
Canada, as a northern country, is particularly vulnerable to climate change. New projections from Environment Canada suggest that central and northern Canada will warm four to six degrees by 2050, decreasing to three to four degrees along eastern and western coastlines.
Climate models suggest such a rise will have serious effects on regional weather patterns, forests, fisheries and agriculture. The prairies will experience more droughts, the north more forest fires and the entire country more severe storms.
Stewart, appointed in June as environment minister, is determined to make global warming a central focus of federal policy-making.
But to do so, she'll have to convince key cabinet colleagues, such as Finance Minister Paul Martin, Industry Minister John Manley and Natural Resource Minister Ralph Goodale, that global warming poses a real threat to Canada's environment and economy.
"If we don't deal with the climate change issue, which international science now says is due in large part to human activities, we won't need to worry about smog or toxics or endangered species because there won't be any left," Stewart said.
"Some Canadians say there could be benefits from climate change, that our cold winters will get warmer, but there's a really serious downside to that as well," she said.
Those negatives will be explored in six reports that examine how global warming will affect the Pacific and Yukon, Prairie and Northern Canada, Ontario, Quebec, Atlantic Canada and the Arctic. The reports will comprise 3,500 pages of scientific research conducted since 1990.
Emissions reduction
In mid-September, Stewart is scheduled to meet with the country's environment ministers in Toronto, where she'll attempt to build support for a national emissions reduction scheme.
"I would like to see us come to a consensus about the urgency and the fact that we all have to take part, that it's in the best interests of all of us to take a national approach," Stewart said.
At the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, Canada agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000.
Ottawa established a voluntary industry reductions program, but it hasn't come close to meeting the Rio target.
Canada's emissions in 1995 were 9.2 per cent above 1990 levels and they're projected to increase substantially in the next century.

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/state-mexico/docview/248512090/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's president, will deliver his State of the Union address today. The speech, delivered on the first day of sessions of the country's new Congress, has caused unprecedented controversy, since opposition legislators have demanded the right to reply in Mr Zedillo's presence. In the speech, Mr Zedillo is expected to emphasise both Mexico's economic recovery and its transition to greater democracy. The session of Congress that begins on September 1 is expected to be dominated by economic issues, principally the country's budget deficit and a possible reduction in value added tax. Lee Teng-hui, Taiwan's president, this week starts a rare overseas trip to bolster ties with Taipei's diplomatic allies in central America and the Caribbean. He is scheduled to attend a global conference from September 7-10 on the expansion and administration of the Panama Canal, which the US will hand over to Panamanian authorities in 2000. The trip has been condemned by China, which regards Taiwan as a rebel province. Beijing has called on Panama to revoke its invitation to Mr Lee, who Chinese authorities allege is secretly fomenting Taiwanese independence, a claim Mr Lee denies. The Taiwanese president's trip will also include a stop in Paraguay. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, arrives in Copenhagen for talks with Danish ministers on UN reform. He will also preside over the establishment of a brigade staff for the multinational UN Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade (Shirbrig), to which troops and equipment will be supplied by the Nordic countries, Canada, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic and Ireland. The force is due to be ready for rapid deployment for UN peace-keeping operations by 1999.

Central American tour
Lee Teng-hui, Taiwan's president, this week starts a rare overseas trip to bolster ties with Taipei's diplomatic allies in central America and the Caribbean. He is scheduled to attend a global conference from September 7-10 on the expansion and administration of the Panama Canal, which the US will hand over to Panamanian authorities in 2000.

The Taiwanese president's trip will also include a stop in Paraguay.
Sleep in peace
Snoring can damage relationships - and there are about 10m snorers in the UK, many of whom are probably doing just that. This week has been proclaimed "National No Snoring Week" in the UK by London's Harley Medical Group. The aim is to highlight the potentially devastating effects of snoring on relationships and to offer snorers and their long-suffering partners a solution.
A show of arms
George Robertson, UK defence secretary, is opening a defence equipment exhibition at Farnborough airfield, Hampshire, England (to September 5). The exhibition, organised by the Defence Export Services Organisation of the UK Ministry of Defence, has as its theme services logistics and equipment support. There will be a maritime display at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard. More than 200 exhibitors have signed up to appear and delegations from 57 countries are due to attend.
Danes in UN talks
Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, arrives in Copenhagen for talks with Danish ministers on UN reform. He will also preside over the establishment of a brigade staff for the multinational UN Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade (Shirbrig), to which troops and equipment will be supplied by the Nordic countries, Canada, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic and Ireland. The force is due to be ready for rapid deployment for UN peace-keeping operations by 1999.
Chile-Japan meeting
Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, the Chilean president, arrives in Japan to hold talks with Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister, and leading politicians and industrialists. The talks will focus on bilateral relations and Japan's recent efforts to expand relations with South American countries. Japanese companies have invested heavily in Chilean copper facilities, and Chilean wine sales to Japan have surged in the past two years.
Landmine conference
The conference on an international treaty for the banning of anti-personnel mines opens in Oslo (to September 19). More than 100 countries engaged in the Canadian-sponsored "Ottawa process" are due to meet to discuss the treaty. Negotiations will centre on transferring political support for a ban into an international legally binding treaty, banning the use, export, production and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines, to be signed in Ottawa in December. Last month US president Bill Clinton, announcing a significant policy decision, said that he would be sending a delegation to the meeting, where the US will argue strongly for an exception to be made of South Korea.
Public holidays
Labor Day in the US; Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, Slovak Republic.
TUESDAY 2
Sarajevo in focus
The third Sarajevo film festival is due open today (to September 10). The festival will show 65 films from 20 countries and will open with Perfect Circle , the first Bosnian film to be made after the recent conflict.
WEDNESDAY 3
Mandela in Switzerland
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa is today due to pay his first official visit to Switzerland, returning home a few hours before the verdict is announced in Lausanne on South Africa's bid to host the Olympics in 2004. Mr Mandela is scheduled to be accompanied by Steve Tshwete, sports minister, and two deputy ministers. He will go to Lausanne on Thursday to meet members of the South African Olympic delegation. The first day of Mr Mandela's visit will focus on the growing trade relationship between the two countries.
Duma returns
The Russian parliament will return from its summer recess. Among other issues it is expected to debate the austere 1998 draft budget, which has already been prepared by the government. Parliamentarians are also expected to debate a new tax code, already approved in the first reading. Officials say the new code is vital to stimulate economic growth.

Hashimoto visits China
Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister, is due to arrive in China for a four-day visit as part of a programme planned to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the normalisation of bilateral relations. The visit represents a daunting diplomatic challenge for Mr Hashimoto, coming amid an escalating bilateral row over Japan's plan to boost its regional military profile and actively support US forces in times of emergency. Tokyo has refused to exclude Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province, from its definition of areas which, in the event of conflict, may require Japanese forces to support US troops. Mr Hashimoto must also contend with China's frequent references to Japan's wartime atrocities in the country.
Discussing derivatives
Executives from international financial institutions and derivatives exchanges are meeting in Bu;rgenstock, Switzerland, for the 18th annual meeting of derivatives markets participants (to September 7). They will discuss topics such as the purpose of an exchange, product innovation and preparations for European economic and monetary union. Deutsche Terminbo;rse, the Frankfurt-based futures and options exchange, and the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest derivatives market, are expected to announce new products.
Nuclear gathering
About 450 nuclear industry experts from 30 countries are in London for the two-day Uranium Institute annual symposium, which this year will focus on growing concerns about climate change. Nuclear power provides only 17 per cent of the world's electricity. The industry will argue that it has addressed concerns over radioactive waste management and that the environmental benefits of nuclear energy - it creates no carbon dioxide emissions or other "greenhouse" gases - outweigh its impacts.
Anniversary tour
President Jorge Sampaio of Portugal begins a 10-day state visit to Brazil on the occasion of the 175th anniversary of its independence from Portugal. The focus is on cultural co-operation and leading figures from the arts, science and the media will be among his 50-strong delegation. The two countries hope to breathe more life into the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, a commonwealth of seven nations set up a year ago. Portugal, a big consumer of Brazilian soap operas, will also sign an agreement on television production during the visit.
Rockabilia
Christie's in London is out to attract collectors of pop memorabilia with a sale today which includes four Remco inflatable Beatles dolls from the 1960s. They are expected to fetch £;200-£;400. Madonna's black satin bustier, adorned with sequins and tassels, is expected to go for £;4,000-£;6,000, while a gold disc presented to Eric Clapton for his song Layla is expected to fetch £;1,000-£;1,500. A menu signed and annotated by the Beatles for the supper following the premier of one of their films is expected to see a price of £;2,500-£;4,500.

Racing towards 2004
The race to stage the 2004 Olympic Games will end to day in Lausanne, Switzerland, when the International Olympic Committee announces the winning city. Five are still in contention, with Rome the favourite, followed by Athens then Buenos Aires, with Cape Town and Stockholm coming along behind. Sweden's bid to stage the games has been marred by a series of bomb attacks by a little-known group calling itself "We Who Built Sweden". It claims hosting the Olympics would be a waste of time. Greece considers it has increased its chances of winning after successfully hosting the World Athletics Championships in Athens last month. However Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek foreign minister, has accused Primo Nebiolo, world athletics chief, of meddling in politics by disparaging Athens' bid to host the Olympics.

EU farm reform
European Union agriculture ministers begin a three-day informal meeting in Luxembourg on Sunday with farm reform high on the agenda. The European Commission sees change, including reductions in prices, as an essential precursor to union enlargement and the next round of world trade negotiations. Germany and France are expected to be the most resistant to reform of a sector that accounts for nearly half of the union's budget.
UUP consider peace talks
The Ulster Unionist Party Council is due to meet in Belfast on Sunday to discuss its approach to the all-party Anglo-Irish peace talks next month. Last month saw the first ever debate on British television between Northern Ireland unionists and the political wing of the IRA. The UUP had previously argued that to engage with Sinn Fein was legitimising the terrorists. The debate raises the prospect that the UUP may be softening its opposition to the planned all-party talks, which Ms Mo Mowlam, Northern Ireland secretary, wants to launch on September 15.
Sumo summit
The annual 15-day autumn grand sumo tournament opens in Tokyo on Sunday. The event is a highlight in the sumo calendar, and draws tens of thousands of spectators to the palatial Kokugikan stadium in northern Tokyo.

Solar power, long regarded as not much more than a curiosity, is attracting new investment because of concerns that carbon dioxide and other ``greenhouse'' gases produced by burning fossil fuels may bring devastating changes in temperature and precipitation worldwide.
``We think solar is something that could be a valuable business for us,'' said John Browne, group chief executive of British Petroleum PLC. BP has invested $20 million in what it says will be one of the largest and most advanced solar cell manufacturing facilities in the world, in Fairfield, Calif.
Solar power represents less than a tenth of a per cent of the total market for energy. Even though it's expected to expand by about 30 per cent this year worldwide, its worth will still be only a little more than $1 billion a year. The United States is the largest producer of solar equipment, but most sales are outside the country.
Browne recently broke ranks with other oil and gas executives when he said the possibility of climate change cannot be discounted and should be acted upon. Part of BP's response, he said, is to develop alternative fuels.
Privately held SunLight Power International has attracted investments from two European insurance companies that are concerned about the storms and rising oceans.
Swiss Reinsurance Co. invested $2.75 million and GAIA Kapital, which is associated with Rolf Gerling of the German Gerling Insurance Group, invested $2 million in SunLight Power, a U.S. company, that plans to supply solar power to developing countries.
Sunlight president Jeff Serfass said his company will be ``providing electric service to rural regions of developing countries where there is no electric service and where the expectation for gaining electric service is out so many years that we provide an option for people to get what we all consider one of the basic commodities in life.''
The company, already operating with a partner in the Dominican Republic, offers electricity for a fee, then installs and operates the equipment at a monthly rate.
The traditional markets for solar power are in areas of the world that power lines don't reach, according to Harvey Forest, head of Solarex Corp. But he said there is a growing market for solar to supplement electric power in countries such as Germany and Japan.
Solarex is a unit of Amoco/Enron Solar, a joint venture of the oil firm and Enron Corp., a natural gas and electricity marketing firm.
Recently, at a United Nations meeting focusing on climate change, President Bill Clinton announced plans to place a million solar energy systems on U.S. roofs by 2010.
Solar power is more costly to produce than electric power from generating plants fired by oil, coal or natural gas. However, in remote areas where the only other possible source of electricity is diesel-powered generators, solar is competitive, according to Solarex's Forest.
Solarex is No. 2 in the worldwide market for solar power. Siemens Solar Industries is
No. 1. The Japanese firm Kyocera Corp. is No. 3, followed by British Petroleum. Solar industry executives hope that, as their market grows, economies of scale and technological innovation will drive prices down.
``We are very small. We're also patient,'' said Forest. ``It takes a long time to develop an energy source. We've only been in business for 25 years, although the technology has been around for longer than that.''

"It could be argued that the tide is turning against the notion of high biodiversity as a controller of ecosystem function and insurance against ecological collapse."
~ J.P. Grime, plant ecologist
Ecologists have long maintained that diversity is one of nature's greatest strengths, but new research suggests that diversity alone does not guarantee strong ecosystems.
In findings that could intensify the debate over endangered species and habitat conservation, three new studies suggest a greater abundance of plant and animal varieties doesn't always translate to better ecological health.
At least equally important, the research found, are the types of species and how they function together.
``Having a long list of Latin names isn't always better than a shorter list of Latin names,'' said Stanford University biologist Peter Vitousek, co-author of one of the studies published in the journal Science.
Separate experiments in California, Minnesota and Sweden, found that diversity often had little bearing on the performance of ecosystems -- at least as measured by the growth and health of native plants.
In fact, the communities with the greatest biological richness were often the poorest when it came to productivity and the cycling of nutrients.
One study compared plant life on 50 remote islands in northern Sweden that are prone to frequent wildfires from lightning strikes.
Scientist David Wardle of Landcare Research in Lincoln, New Zealand, and colleagues at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, found that islands dominated by a few species of plants recovered more quickly than nearby islands with greater biological diversity.
Similar findings were reported by University of Minnesota researchers who studied savannah grasses, and by Stanford's Vitousek and colleague David Hooper, who concluded that functional characteristics of plant species were more important than the number of varieties in determining how ecosystems performed.
British plant ecologist J.P. Grime, in a commentary summarizing the research, said there is as yet no ``convincing evidence that species diversity and ecosystem function are consistently and causally related.''
``It could be argued,'` he added, ``that the tide is turning against the notion of high biodiversity as a controller of ecosystem function and insurance against ecological collapse.''
CAUTION
But the scientists also cautioned against misinterpretation of their findings.
In some types of ecosystems -- including rainforests and regions that are prone to flooding and drought -- a high degree of species variation appears to be vital.
And Vitousek, the Stanford biologist, added that diversity brings other benefits that aren't easily quantified in scientific experiments measuring plant output.
For one, biological and genetic variation can help ecosystem adapt to drastic environmental changes.
``If you're asking which ecosystem can better maintain itself in the face of something like global climate change, it's the one with the longer list of names,'' he said.
Grime argued that policy makers should not dismiss biological diversity as unimportant, but he urged a new emphasis on identifying and protecting the ``irreplaceable species'' within ecosystems, placing greater emphasis on functional attributes of plants and animals rather than on sheer numbers.
The importance of preserving biological diversity has long been an article of faith in the environmental community and a cornerstone of the nation's conservation policies.
Noted Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson describes species diversity -- ``the world's available gene pool'' -- as ``one of our planet's most important and irreplaceable resources.''
More than 160 nations have signed a United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, pledging to adopt regulations to conserve biological resources and reduce habitat disruption.
Environmentalist said the newest scientific findings do nothing to undermine the principles underlying policies that protect endangered animals and plants.
David Olson, a conservation biologist with the World Wildlife Fund in Washington, said the research should serve mainly to help scientists and policy makers better understand the relationship between biodiversity and the ``functionality and resiliency'` of ecosystems.
``There isn't a single set of rules that can be applied to all ecosystems around the world,'' Olson said, ``and there many different reasons for valuing individual species. Each is irreplacable: We will not achieve that expression of life on earth once it's gone.''

Solar power, long regarded as not much more than a curiosity, is rapidly growing and attracting new investment because of concerns that carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse" gases produced by burning fossil fuels may bring devastating changes in temperature and precipitation worldwide.
"We think solar is something which could be a valuable business for us," said John Browne, group chief executive of British Petroleum PLC. BP recently has invested $20 million in what it says will be one of the largest and most technologically advanced solar cell manufacturing facilities in the world, to be located in Fairfield, Calif.
Solar power represents less than a tenth of a percent of the total market for energy. And even though industry officials expect it to expand by about 30 percent this year worldwide, its worth will still be only a little more than $1 billion a year. The United States is the largest producer of solar equipment, but most of the sales are outside the country.
Browne recently broke ranks with other oil and gas executives when he said in a speech at Stanford University in May that BP believes that the possibility of climate change cannot be discounted and should be acted upon. Part of BP's response, he said, is to develop alternative fuels for the long term.
A privately held Washington company, SunLight Power International, has attracted investments from two European insurance companies that are concerned about the storms and rising oceans that might result from global warming. Swiss Reinsurance Co. has invested $2.75 million and GAIA Kapital, which is associated with Rolf Gerling of the German Gerling Insurance Group, invested $2 million in the U.S. company, which plans to supply and service solar power to communities in developing countries beyond the reach of the power grid.
Bruno Letsch, head of Swiss Re's Investment Center Europe, said the company was attracted both by the economics and the environmental potential of the venture.
"We are starting a business that focuses on providing electric service to rural regions of developing countries where there is no electric service and where the expectation for gaining electric service is out so many years that we provide an option for people to get what we all consider one of the basic commodities in life," said Jeff Serfass, president of SunLight Power.
The company, which is already operating with a partner in the Dominican Republic, goes into such an area and offers electricity for a fee, then installs, operates and maintains the equipment at a monthly rate.
The traditional markets for solar power are in areas of the world that power lines don't reach, according to Harvey Forest, chairman of Solarex Corp. But he said there is a growing market for solar to supplement power in countries served by traditional electric generating facilities, especially in Germany and Japan. The Frederick, Md.-based company is a unit of Amoco/Enron Solar, a joint venture of the oil company and Enron Corp., a natural gas and electricity trading and marketing firm.
Recently, at a United Nations meeting focusing on climate change, President Clinton announced plans to place a million solar energy systems on roofs in the United States by 2010.
"Generally speaking, I think the solar industry has a very positive future," said Energy Secretary Federico Pen~a, whose department is overseeing the initiative.
Solar power for the most part is more costly to produce than electric power from generating plants fired by oil, coal or natural gas. However, in remote areas where the only other possible source of electricity is diesel-powered generators, solar is competitive, according to Solarex's Forest.
Solarex is the No. 2 player in the worldwide market for solar power. Siemens Solar Industries is No. 1. The Japanese firm Kyocera Corp. is No. 3, followed by British Petroleum. Solar industry executives hope that, as the market for solar power grows, economies of scale and technological innovation will drive prices down.
"We are very small. We're also patient," said Forest. "It takes a long time to develop an energy source. We've only been in business for 25 years, although the technology has been around for longer than that."
Scott Sklar, executive director of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said that the global movements toward democratization and privatization are driving the industry as well as concerns about the environment. As governments become democratic, "they want to serve the total population," he said, and as utility companies are privatized, they look for new ways to compete.
"We've grown tenfold in 10 years," he said. "Last year, I cut ribbons at four new U.S. manufacturing plants. This year, it will be six to eight."
Sklar said there are parallels between the market for solar power and the market for cellular telephones, which use solar power to drive their networks in remote areas.
In the 1970s, the big phone companies didn't believe cellular telephones, which are more costly in the United States than the traditional wired phone, would find a niche. Cellular phone service is now 12 percent of the market, Sklar noted.

The process works like this: When the sun's light strikes a photovoltaic cell -- a photosensitive collector usually made of a semiconductor such as silicon -- an electrical current is produced. Individual solar cells are combined to create photovoltaic modules that produce a specific amount of power. These modules, in turn, can be combined to create arrays that produce larger amounts of power. The manner in which these cells and modules are combined electrically (in series and in parallel) determines the voltage and amperage they deliver.

Abstract: August in Washington usually means temperatures in the 90s and high humidity. With most of the politicians out of town (and taking their hot air with them), temperatures are in the mid-80s, dropping into the 50s some nights. The Clinton administration thinks it's an ideal time to step up the attack against "global warming." Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is such a true believer in global warming that he recently characterized those who doubt there's enough scientific evidence for such a diagnosis as "un-American." He further claimed that energy-producing companies are engaged in a "conspiracy" to discredit the theory. President Bill Clinton has promised the United States will present strong proposals to reduce levels of greenhouse gases when an environmental conference is held in Kyoto, Japan, in December. He will do so without a scientific consensus that there is such a phenomenon as "g lobal warming." Even if the threat were real, the uneven proposals to combat it would produce more negative than positive effects.

Political pressure is cracking the once-solid wall debunking global warming by producers of fossil fuels. The largest is British Petroleum, whose chairman, John Browne, says there is now enough scientific evidence to warrant concern about a link between human activity and the "Earth's changing climate."
Statistics frequently cited by those who believe in global warming all ude to the 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature in this century. What they don't mention is that this increase occurred mostly before 1940, while the intensity of man-made greenhouse gases and efforts to reduce them has been greater since 1940.
A 1995 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate." But the document admits that "our ability to quantify the human influence on global climate is currently limited . . . because there are uncertainties in key factors."
This uncertainty hasn't dimmed the zeal of the high priests of the environment who believe anyone who does not blindly accept their doctrines is an Earth-hating polluter and enemy of Bambi and little children.
The fundamentalist Environmental Protection Agency is ready to impose its will on all but the main polluters - the so-called "developing countries," including China, North Korea, Mexico and Brazil.
The EPA has drawn up a list of proposals, most involving higher taxes and more regulations. By some calculations these proposals could raise gas prices 50 cents a gallon and increase the price of a car $2,000 to $4,000. Conservative estimates place the loss to the gross domestic product if these higher taxes are implemented at $350 billion.
Jobs could be lost and, under proposed Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards, the safety of vehicles would be compromised. In 1991 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates highway safety, found that since the 1970s, downsizing vehicles was responsible for 2,000 deaths and 20,000 serious injuries. More recently, a study by Harvard's John Graham found that increasing the fuel standards to 40 miles per gallon would result in an additional 1,650 deaths and 8,500 serious injuries a year.
Other proposals to reduce carbon emissions include charging an annual inspection fee based on miles driven, highway user fees, a pay-at-the-pump auto insurance program to provide coverage only at the moment it's needed (stay at home and save money, get it?), natural-gas price controls, a national bottle and tire deposit-return program and creation of a "Solar Hot Water Heaters for Southern Low-Income Homes" program.
British Petroleum is already waving the white flag of surrender and is working with the ayatollahs at the Environmental Defense Fund to help them achieve the group's objectives.
If this environmental wackoism is seen in religious terms, it is easier to reject as fanaticism. While no one is for dirty air and water, fewer people should favor an imposed theocracy based on a philosophy that the Earth is holy and that the environmental gods must be appeased.

ON GLOBAL WARMING, THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION OFFERS MAINLY HOT AIR: [SOONER EDITION]

Abstract: August in Washington usually means temperatures in the 90s and high humidity. With most of the politicians out of town (and taking their hot air with them), temperatures are in the mid-80s, dropping into the 50s some nights. The Clinton administration thinks it's an ideal time to step up the attack against "global warming." Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is such a true believer in global warming that he recently characterized those who doubt there's enough scientific evidence for such a diagnosis as "un-American." He further claimed that energy-producing companies are engaged in a "conspiracy" to discredit the theory. President Clinton has promised the United States will present strong proposals to reduce levels of greenhouse gases at an environmental conference in Kyoto, Japan, in December. He will do so without a scientific consensus that there is such a phenomenon as "global warming." Even if the threat were real, the uneven proposals to combat it would produce more negative than positive effects.

Oil exploration raises a legitimate issue for Greenpeace to address: [London edition]

Full text: From Mr Chris Hewett.
Sir, In accusing Greenpeace of being "intellectually risible" for campaigning against oil exploration ("Protesters in deep water", August 12), your editorial comment was uncharacteristically subjective. First, climate change is now an accepted fact by all but a handful of scientists.
The insurance industry is now among those calling for urgent action to cut CO{2} emissions. It may not have the emotional resonance of saving the whale, but many would argue it is a far more important issue for an international environment organisation to concern itself with.
Second, your dismissal of renewable energy sources as "expensive", "ugly and annoying" fails to acknowledge the vast technological capabilities of the energy industry. One could argue that deep sea oil exploration itself was prohibitively expensive not many years ago. The costs of wind and solar energy have been falling at similarly rapid rates, as improvements have been made in design and siting.
Of course measures to curb energy demand from governments are the correct way to address climate change. However, when governments fail to deliver, as they have so far on climate change, pressure groups sometimes take matters into their own hands. You are right to question the tactics and the target of Greenpeace's latest campaign, but the issue is most certainly a legitimate one.
Chris Hewett, research fellow, Institute for Public Policy Research , 30-32 Southampton Street, London WC2E 7RA
From Professor David R. Cope.
Sir, Your leader "Protesters in deep water", regarding the actions of Greenpeace in the North Atlantic did not recognise the full dimensions of the organisation's position. You state that Greenpeace displays "the feeblest grasp of proportion" regarding the potential for widespread use of renewable energy but, to its credit, it has also assiduously promoted energy conservation as a strategy, (which you call for in your leader).
Although such strategies are not favoured by the more "fundamentalist" tendencies within the pressure group, Greenpeace has recently teamed up with various companies to promote energy efficient technologies.
What, however, is most curious about Greenpeace's current actions is why it is targeting the international oil industry. It claims its primary motivation is potential global warming from carbon dioxide emissions. Yet for each unit of energy produced, the burning of coal results in about 30 per cent more emissions of carbon dioxide than the burning of petroleum. Furthermore, if compared with natural gas, the production of which is also a major activity of most of the international petroleum companies, coal burning releases about 80 per cent more carbon dioxide.
Perhaps it is the opportunity for media coverage, rather than environmental rationality, which determines Greenpeace's choice of targets.
David R. Cope, UK Centre for Economic and Environmental Development , Suite E, King's Parade, Cambridge CB2 1SJ
From Mr T.J. Evans.
Sir, Chris Rose of Greenpeace UK points out (Letters, August 13) that the world's atmosphere cannot sustain the burn of more than a small percentage of known fossil fuel reserves. Indeed, it is now widely acknowledged that a shift to solar and other renewable forms of energy will be a feature of the first quarter of the next century. For the short term, however, there will be no realistic alternative to fossil fuels. It will be important to use those sources of such fuels which are both economic to produce and environmentally safe and it seems to me there is considerable merit in exploiting those resources which are well away from centres of population. It is also strategically important to this country to have reserves under its own control.
Furthermore, the deep-water hydrocarbon resource which BP seeks to exploit is a valuable feedstock for the world's petrochemical industry. The range of products created from a single barrel of oil represent a diverse and valuable resource for the community. Chris Rose's view is blinkered to the extent that he sees only a traditional exploitation for these reserves rather than allowing for the ingenuity of engineers and scientists to make more effective use of the reserve.
Within the chemical engineering community, 18 leaders of the world's leading scientific societies, including Keith Taylor, president of the IChemE (and chairman and chief executive of Esso UK ), committed to the London Communique in April this year. Our profession signed up to use our skills to improve the quality of life: foster employment, advance economic and social development, and protect the environment. This challenge encompasses the essence of sustainable development. We will work to make the world a better place for the future.

Full text:   ONE OF the most encouraging signs in a long-raging environmental battle is political in nature. Some large corporations - including the world's third largest energy company - have concluded the time has arrived for action to stave off global warming.
This marks a change in the traditional attitude of big business, which has largely tried to discredit evidence of global warming and water down conservation measures seeking to mitigate the climatic processes.
Without corporate support, political designs to do something about global warming are destined to fail. Even with business backing, finding agreement between rich, developed nations and poor, underdeveloped nations is problematic.
Global warming occurs when fuels burned in industrial plants and vehicles release gases that accumulate in the atmosphere, trapping heat. Carbon dioxide is the biggest culprit. Many studies show that temperatures around the globe have increased over the last century and a half, since the onset of the industrial revolution. If the trend is maintained, consequences could be catastrophic. They include rising sea levels and the creation of new deserts.
Five years ago, the nations of the world agreed to nonbinding measures to limit emissions of so-called greenhouse gases. Not surprisingly, releases have continued to increase. Now President Clinton and other world leaders are under pressure to go beyond voluntary gestures when they hold a December follow-up in Kyoto, Japan, to the 1992 Earth Summit.
Last week, some industrial leaders meeting in Bonn, Germany, and with Clinton in Washington acknowledged that, while global warming is not yet a certainty, it is time to do something.
The time for action, said British Petroleum Chairman John Browne in a speech, "is not when the link between greenhouse gases and climate change is conclusively proven, but when the possibility cannot be discounted and is taken seriously."
Two business groups - the Climate Change Partnership and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy - support taking steps to fight global warming. Utilities and insurance companies are among the business interests to join the cause.
Many corporations, of course, still have not felt the heat. They cling to shreds of scientific uncertainty as a shield for their profit pictures. Over our dead bodies, they seem to be saying. And eventually, they'll undoubtedly be proved correct.

Global Warming Balance Sheet: What We Really Know: [ALL 08/08/97 Edition]

Abstract: We've already heard from climate researchers that the earth's surface temperature has risen about 1 degree F. since the 19th century. We've been told about the potential for further warming of several degrees that may cause ecological disruption. But the tough economic - political really - question is, how much is our stewardship of nature worth? Scientists have published hundreds of papers on the potential impacts of projected climactic changes. Their estimates range from small benefits to catastrophic losses. To try to sort this out, Yale economist William Nordhaus asked 19 economists, technologists, and natural scientists familiar with the scores of studies of "climate damages" to estimate such damage as a percentage of lost gross domestic product (GDP) for the world. Using a hypothetical scenario of 3 degrees C. warming by AD 2100, the best estimate of the group Nordhaus referred to as mainstream economists was about a 1 percent GDP loss - with fairly large uncertainty. The natural scientists estimated 10 times greater damage - but with even greater uncertainty. Although there is some theoretical reason to expect that warmer ocean temperatures could produce stronger storms, this analysis is controversial, and no one can credibly attribute some percentage of Andrew's damage to global warming. But we do know that as the earth warmed, sea levels became about 4 to 10 inches higher than a century ago, which means that any storm, natural or enhanced by global warming, will have an accompanying storm surge that penetrates farther inland and creates greater damages. Typical global warming scenarios include projections for a one-half foot to three foot greater sea level rise over the next 100 years. Those rises clearly will pose costs and risks to hundreds of millions of coastal dwellers - and even to the existence of some island states.

Full text:   It is important for Americans to address the questions: So what if the climate changes? How much would disruption of the expected climate disrupt nature or our economy?
We've already heard from climate researchers that the earth's surface temperature has risen about 1 degree F. since the 19th century. We've been told about the potential for further warming of several degrees that may cause ecological disruption. But the tough economic - political really - question is, how much is our stewardship of nature worth? Scientists have published hundreds of papers on the potential impacts of projected climactic changes. Their estimates range from small benefits to catastrophic losses.
To try to sort this out, Yale economist William Nordhaus asked 19 economists, technologists, and natural scientists familiar with the scores of studies of "climate damages" to estimate such damage as a percentage of lost gross domestic product (GDP) for the world. Using a hypothetical scenario of 3 degrees C. warming by AD 2100, the best estimate of the group Nordhaus referred to as mainstream economists was about a 1 percent GDP loss - with fairly large uncertainty. The natural scientists estimated 10 times greater damage - but with even greater uncertainty.
Part of the difference in these professionals' world views is the higher value that natural scientists put on nature's unpriced services, like waste recycling, flood control, or biotic diversity. Economists are more optimistic that humans can invent substitutes for such ecological services. Let's suppose the economists are right. Even 1 percent of world GDP lost annually is, in today's terms, some $200 billion each year! Where do such dollar values come from?
First, consider sea level. Hurricane Andrew caused unprecedented losses, about $40 billion. Before 1987 no weather event had caused damages in excess of $1 billion. Since then, several have caused tens of billions of dollars in damages. The insurance industry is understandably very alarmed.
Although there is some theoretical reason to expect that warmer ocean temperatures could produce stronger storms, this analysis is controversial, and no one can credibly attribute some percentage of Andrew's damage to global warming. But we do know that as the earth warmed, sea levels became about 4 to 10 inches higher than a century ago, which means that any storm, natural or enhanced by global warming, will have an accompanying storm surge that penetrates farther inland and creates greater damages. Typical global warming scenarios include projections for a one-half foot to three foot greater sea level rise over the next 100 years. Those rises clearly will pose costs and risks to hundreds of millions of coastal dwellers - and even to the existence of some island states.
Now, consider hydrological extremes. By hydrological extremes I mean droughts and floods. Are the many costly floods that occurred across the United States over the past five years, or the droughts in 1988, or the heat wave in 1995 that killed hundreds of vulnerable elderly people in Chicago, merely two "snake eyes" in a row from nature, or, rather, are we "loading the climate dice?"
First, some theory. Since we add heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, which, in turn, add energy to the earth's surface, some of that energy will be used to evaporate water. No one who is knowledgeable disputes that. More evaporation globally means more rainfall globally. Thus when the atmosphere configures itself for locally heavy rains, more evaporation means heavier rains on average. Likewise, as farmers or lawn waterers know, when the atmosphere is in a drier mode, higher temperatures suck more water from the soils.
Taken together, these physical arguments provide the rationale for forecasting increased droughts and floods from global warming. But this is physical reasoning, not proof.
So now to some data. Tom Karl and his colleagues at the National Climate Center in Asheville, N.C., have analyzed reports from thousands of weather stations in the US over the past century and found about a 10 percent increase in precipitation since 1910. More significantly, most of this increase occurred in the top 10 percentile of extreme daily rainfall events - that is, the "gully washers" that insurance companies fear. While these observations are consistent both with theory and climate model predictions, and thus are strong circumstantial evidence for a global warming impact, certain proof will take a few more decades of performing this unplanned experiment on "laboratory Earth."
Finally, in a system as complex as the earth-atmosphere-ocean-ice biosphere system - what scientists call a "nonlinear" system - we cannot have precise forecasts that are credible. But, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted in concluding its 1995 assessment report, "When rapidly forced, nonlinear systems are especially subject to unexpected behavior." My free translation of this concern is that reducing the pressure that humans put on nature is an insurance policy against "nasty surprises."
NOBEL LAUREATES ON 21ST CENTURY CLIMATE
* Professor Schneider, Stanford University climatologist and author of the adjoining column, recently joined six other natural scientists at a public briefing for President Clinton. Their message: that global warming is a real phenomenon.

Redesigned Accords have low-pollution engines: [FINAL Edition]

Full text: TRAVERSE CITY, Michigan -- Honda says it will use a low-pollution engine in two-thirds of the redesigned Accords the automaker will introduce this fall, as well as in 200,000 1998-model Civics.
Two-thirds of the redesigned Accords that Honda will introduce in September will qualify as ``low-emission vehicles,'' based on California criteria, the company said. California's standards on hydrocarbon admissions are 70 per cent below the most stringent U.S. federal requirements, a spokesman said.
Honda also said it will sell 200,000 1998 Civics with the low-emission engines. The Accords and Civics will be available throughout the U.S. and Canada.
``Our focus is on creating a balance between the performance and the environmental achievement of the products we sell today,'' Takeo Fukui, president of Honda of America Manufacturing, told an annual auto seminar on emissions.
At the same conference, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said pending clean-air rules from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and a worldwide climate-change treaty being readied for December signing are based on sloppy science and will devastate job creation for industrialized nations.
President Bill Clinton recently signed off on an EPA proposal to toughen standards for soot and smog. The rules, which have drawn criticism from industry groups, would require reduced emissions from utilities, autos and other sources, beginning early in the next century.
In December, representatives of most of the world's nations will gather in Kyoto, Japan, with the aim of setting legally binding targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to combat global warming.
``There's no doubt that these proposals will have a huge, severe impact on the (gross domestic product) of major nations,'' Ford Chairman Alex Trotman said.
Ford is spending billions of dollars to develop cleaner internal combustion engines, alternate-fuel vehicles and cleaner factories, Mr. Trotman said, adding that Ford has sold low volumes of a low-pollution engine similar to Honda's for several years. He said he didn't know when the technology will be introduced into large-volume cars like the Taurus.
``We all want a clean environment,'' Mr. Trotman said. ``We also want a productive, job-filled economy, and a affordable cars and trucks that function in a useful way.''
An EPA spokeswoman had no comment on the automakers' remarks, but noted that EPA Administrator Carol Browner has said most regions will be able to comply with the new air-quality standards by capping emissions from utilities.
As for automakers, ``we have no doubt that they would be able to meet the technological challenge'' of producing less-polluting cars, said the spokeswoman, Martha Casey.
The EPA has a separate program for auto emissions, and later this week plans to issue a second set of guidelines for states and companies working toward a national ``clean-car'' program.
The climate-change treaty, which is still being negotiated, aims to slow climate change by capping emissions of carbon-based gases, which are caused by, among other things, the burning of fossil fuels.
Energy consumption and GDP have grown at parallel rates in developed countries for decades, Mr. Trotman said. A mandate to lower carbon dioxide emissions 15 per cent below 1990 levels by 2010 --one of the proposals currently on the table -- toys with that relationship and jeopardizes job creation, he said.
Mr. Trotman also criticized a plan to make the rules stricter for developed nations than for developing nations such as China. The Senate recently resolved not to agree to any treaty containing such a double standard.
When the EPA proposed its new soot and ozone requirements, ``it ignored some very vehement dissent'' within its own scientific advisory panel, said Thomas Gale, executive vice president of Chrysler Corp. A recent study by 100 scientists challenged the idea that the global climate is warming, he noted.

Sudden New Heat on Global Warmth As climate changes, industry skeptics join Clinton in bid to curb greenhouse gases: [ALL 08/07/97 Edition]

Abstract: He proposed a tax on fuels that produce carbon dioxide, the main "greenhouse gas" many scientists believe is the culprit behind climate change. But the "carbon tax" idea went nowhere - and that was even before Republicans took over Congress - and Mr. Clinton fell back on proposals relying largely on voluntary efforts. Now, the White House once again is emphasizing what is becoming a profound environmental issue that could have universal impact. Meeting with industry leaders this week, Clinton cited "pretty clear evidence that the climate is changing" and called for "realistic but binding limits to emissions of greenhouse gases." The key word here was "binding," meaning that strict limits would have to be met. The White House activity comes at a time when the prospect of global warming, while still a subject of considerable scientific and political debate, seems to be more of a certainty. And it follows a shift in position by some industry skeptics who now agree that steps should be taken to head off global warming.

Full text:   A few months into his presidency, Bill Clinton got burned on global warming.
He proposed a tax on fuels that produce carbon dioxide, the main "greenhouse gas" many scientists believe is the culprit behind climate change. But the "carbon tax" idea went nowhere - and that was even before Republicans took over Congress - and Mr. Clinton fell back on proposals relying largely on voluntary efforts.
Now, the White House once again is emphasizing what is becoming a profound environmental issue that could have universal impact. Meeting with industry leaders this week, Clinton cited "pretty clear evidence that the climate is changing" and called for "realistic but binding limits to emissions of greenhouse gases." The key word here was "binding," meaning that strict limits would have to be met.
The White House activity comes at a time when the prospect of global warming, while still a subject of considerable scientific and political debate, seems to be more of a certainty. And it follows a shift in position by some industry skeptics who now agree that steps should be taken to head off global warming.
British Petroleum has broken from its oil-producing colleagues to acknowledge the likely existence of global warming. And major insurance companies around the world (which must cover the cost of property damage when extreme weather events occur) have called for "early, substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions."
"The balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on climate," says Jane Lubchenco, professor of zoology at Oregon State University and one of seven prominent scientists who recently briefed the president and Vice President Al Gore on the latest evidence that human activities are affecting climate patterns around the world.
The event (which featured three Nobel laureates) was seen by the White House as an opportunity to educate the public as well on a subject that can seem arcane and threatening.
Dr. Lubchenco cites as evidence increases in recorded temperatures, changes in sea levels, increases in the incidence of tropical diseases, and more instances of extreme weather events such as floods, hurricanes, and droughts.
"You can't say that this flood or this hurricane or this drought was caused by climate change," cautions Lubchenco, who recently finished up a term as president of the 144,000-member American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). "What you can say is that we are seeing increases in the frequency of these things, and those increases are consistent with the predictions of the {computer} models."
This, in essence, is the same thing some 2,500 scientists on the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have said in recent reports.
Skeptics say such assertions aren't supported by hard facts, and they warn that forcing sharp changes in such things as transportation, energy generation, and manufacturing at this point could hurt the economy.
Under United Nations auspices, representatives of developed and developing countries met recently in Bonn to lay the groundwork for a December summit of 160 nations in Kyoto, Japan. Delegates to the Kyoto meeting aim to conclude an agreement that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions well below current levels.
Gail McDonald, president of the Global Climate Coalition (an industry organization), warns that moving now on such an agreement "could have devastating impacts on our economy" and "may easily become the most economically devastating federal policy blunder of the decade."
Clinton, too, is sensitive to the economic part of the global warming equation.
In his meeting Monday with 10 chief executives of utility, oil, gas, steel, chemical, manufacturing, and financial services companies, the president said "we have to do it in a way that keeps our economy growing."
Advocacy groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Environmental Defense Fund have insisted all along that energy conservation and alternatives to carbon-emitting fuels could reduce the threat of global warming while maintaining a healthy economy. But now, some companies are aligning themselves with this way of thinking as well.
"It is a moment for change and for rethinking of corporate responsibility," British Petroleum chief executive John Browne said at a speech at Stanford University in May. While noting the "large elements of uncertainty about cause and effect," Mr. Browne acknowledged "an effective consensus among the world's leading scientists and serious and well-informed people outside the scientific community that there is a discernible human influence on the climate, and a link between the concentration of carbon dioxide and the increase in temperature."
In addition to environmental and economic concerns, some experts see global warming as a matter of national security. Paul Nitze, who negotiated arms-control agreements with the former Soviet Union during the Reagan administration, says nations must "address the looming threat to geopolitical stability posed by climate change."
"The question is no longer 'Is our climate changing?' but 'What can we do about it?' " he wrote in a recent column in The Washington Post.

Full text: Letters to the Editor
Rick Orlov's (July 28) article on Steve Soboroff pointed out the many sides of this man. He is amazing.
As the president of the Recreation and Parks Commission, the fact he personally visited the 375 parks in the city should give you an idea of just how dedicated he has been as a commissioner.
I doubt in all the years this commission has existed that anyone has ever taken the time to do what Soboroff has done. He is unique because he gets down in the trenches and finds out for himself what this city is doing and what the local residents wish the city were doing.
He takes a look at what the public is complaining about and generally finds a solution that everyone can live with, then most important of all, he makes sure it gets done.
Soboroff was instrumental in starting a Golf Task Force along with Leroy Chase shortly after they became members of the commission. We are starting our second year of being a Golf Advisory Committee made up of representatives of the Men and Women's Municipal Golf Courses, the golf concessionaires and the Men and Women's Public Links Associations.
It is gratifying to see our input taken seriously by the department. Without Soboroff this may never have happened.
Thank you Rick Orlov for letting the people of Los Angeles know what a gem we have in this man. And thank you, Steve Soboroff, for all your hard work.

Informing misinformed
William O. Felsman (Forum, July 30) concludes that "global warming is a scam based upon junk science" promoted by "the same folks who touted the imminent ice age and acid rain" and other "nonexistent environmental calamities."
Actually, acid rain still is recognized by a consensus of atmospheric scientists as a problem which causes fish kills and deforestation. Geologists still claim that there was an ice age (the Pleistocene Epoch) that ended 10,000 years ago. Further, the years 1550-1850 are known as the Little Ice Age, a period when glaciers again crept forward. This period ended, notably enough, when the Industrial Revolution led to a large increase in the burning of fossil fuels.
It is the burning of fossil fuels, coupled with deforestation (most of it not from acid rain) that is causing the build-up of carbon dioxide mainly responsible for global warming.
Felsman is so misinformed that he thinks the argument is that carbon dioxide is generating heat. He says that only the sun heats the Earth. Actually, carbon dioxide traps heat from the sun that would otherwise escape by infrared radiation.
He thinks that those who warn us about global warming are lying in order to seize political power, though he does not explain this peculiar notion. Who is warning us? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is an international network of 2,500 scientists specializing in climate study which has issued at least two reports (1990 and 1992) concluding that global warming by man-made sources has already begun, and that "greenhouse" gasses are "substantially increasing" ("Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, 1990").
The National Academy of Sciences, in Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming (1992), states that "greenhouse warming poses a potential threat sufficient to merit prompt responses."
A November 1991 Gallup Poll found that 66 percent of research scientists thought that human-induced global warming had already begun. Most of the rest were undecided whether it had started, but only 2 percent of those polled disagreed that substantial warming would occur over the next 50 to 100 years.
Felsman says that our future is too important to be delegated to "naked, would-be emperors." Well, neither should it be guided by the badly uninformed.

Zacarias from same mold
In a July 3 article by Daily News Staff Writer Terri Hardy, ("LAUSD superintendent gives posts, raises to three aides"), it is quite obviously demonstrated that Ruben Zacarias is truly a product of the environment that spawned him.
The LAUSD always has had a penchant for throwing money at problems. The rub is that the problems keep getting worse and the amount of money is always increasing.
Zacarias is true to form in awarding a group of aides salary increases as high as 39 percent. That is the crux of the problem. Awarding overlords of a failed system massive salary increases is like giving the crew of the Titanic big raises for doing a good job.
Even Jeff Horton voted against the increases - the same Jeff Horton whose first official act as president of the school board was to award Board of Education employees "live in" coverage on their insurance, a gift to the homosexual community of which he is admittedly a member.
When that chicken comes home to roost, we taxpayers will be coughing up millions for AIDS-related disabilities alone.
It has become painfully clear that antiquated business and personnel practices, in concert with unprincipled unions, are about to sink our "Titanic."
I hope there is a Peter Ueberroth in our future, unfettered by the bureaucracies that caused him to resign his previous Los Angeles assignment, a real businessman who could assure a dollar of learning for every dollar spent. I'm sure, under his guidance, Zacarias' aides would be told to earn their present salaries or get out. After all, the 1984 Olympics was the most successful of all time. We could have the most successful school system of all time.
We must get rid of the entrenched bureaucrats, below-standard teachers and the tenure system, and our schools will thrive. Where are you, Peter Ueberroth?

As the parent of three school-age children, I am absolutely outraged at Ruben Zacarias' first great move as superintendent of the LAUSD. To promote and give pay increases of up to 39 percent to three staff members for any reason whatsoever only shows that it will be business as usual for our school district.
This nonsense about freeing himself to work on student performance is ridiculous. What is needed is to get the money out of the ivory tower and into the classrooms.
Zacarias apparently has no concerns about spending the money this way as the school board is more interested in giving him, their "breath of fresh air," what he wants than in what is best for our children.
Like many families, we pay taxes and private school tuition. I certainly resent the fact that I must continue to support a school district that is unable to provide an education for my children.

Sorority off base
I just read a letter from Binnie Petty, representing the Beta Pi Sigma sorority, regarding CSUN President Blenda Wilson. I agree with Petty that there has been a tremendous amount of press given to Wilson's decision to eliminate four of CSUN's sports programs.
I also agree that academics is the primary charter at any university and that the athletic programs are secondary.
However, beyond those two points, Petty and her sorority sisters lose total credibility.
Her position is that the letter-writing public and the Daily News have been "spewing furor" and that Wilson has been "attacked and smeared more like a politician" over her decision to "implement gender equity."
The fact that there has been such a public outcry over this decision is a clear indication that something is terribly wrong here, and it has nothing to do with academics vs. athletics. It has everything to do with an unjust and prejudicial action taken by a public official.
Equity in funding between men's and women's sports is a good thing, and I wholeheartedly support it. It is not only the fair thing to do, the improvement our women have shown in international sports competition since the enactment of Title IX proves that it has had an immediate and positive effect.
The problem at CSUN is not that gender equity has been established. The problem is how Wilson chose to solve the $900,000 fiscal shortfall that resulted from enacting those measures. Had she decided to delete the soccer, volleyball, baseball/softball and swimming programs in their entirety at CSUN, there would not have been such a negative public outcry. It would have been seen as a tough but necessary decision.
However, Wilson did not do that.
Petty's position seems to be that Wilson is somehow immune from public scrutiny and should not be held accountable for her actions. While Wilson is not an elected official of California, she is an employee of the state and at some level has a responsibility to its taxpayers.
As with many special-interest groups today, Petty and her sorority sisters have allowed themselves to blindly support the inappropriate actions of an individual that their organization champions.
I choose to deplore the actions taken by Blenda Wilson. I am pleased to see that she has recently made herself available for the top position at another university outside of California. I wish her the best of luck in obtaining that position.

Terrorism won't go away
By now it has become clear that acts of terrorism are not about to cease in the Middle East. It is clear that no matter what sort of peace is eventually carved out, some radical group or another will be displeased, and that displeasure will lead to moIre cowardly acts on innocent civilians and tourists, as well as military and governmental personnel. It seems that since this is the case, the best solution to terrorism is to do exactly the opposite of what the terrorists demand.
Given the religious nature of the clash of ideologies in the Middle East, the Israel-Palestinian conflict will lead either to an uneasy peace or to war. War kills vastly more people than singular acts of terrorism, so why let this most recent bombing in Israel achieve its goal of hamstringing the already-stalled peace talks? Perhaps a brief period of suspension, out of respect to the killed or injured, seems appropriate, but even this doesn't effect any progress toward peace. Certainly, human emotions like anger and grief come into play, but if I were to die in a terrorist attack, I would not want my death to lead to intransigence of war. I would want my death to led to a stepping-up of negotiations, a more committed attempt to establish a compromise that both sides can find acceptable. Otherwise, won't more innocent people wind up following me, or worse, won't millions suffer in a devastating war?

North Koreans Pushed To Starvation, Officials SayTwo months of high temperatures and no rain in North Korea have pushed millions of people in the isolated country, whose food stocks were already low, to the brink of famine, reported relief officials returning from recent visits there. A1

Oil Giant Adopts New StanceDelegates to a meeting on climate change in Bonn were surprised to hear British Petroleum, the world's third-largest oil company, announce that it believed that concern about the burning of fossil fuels was scientifically warranted. Industry lobbyists had previously denied a link between greenhouse gases and climate change. A1

Yeltsin Revalues the RubleRussians cynically watched tycoons and bankers feud over the privatization of a nickel mine, but reacted when President Boris N. Yeltsin announced that as of Jan. 1, his government will redenominate the ruble by a factor of 1,000. The move was meant to counter a symbol of inflation, which has led to the current exchange rate of 6,000 rubles to the dollar. Mr. Yeltsin, speaking while on holiday at a health spa, sought to assure wary Russians that the reform would ''not be a confiscation.'' People have until the end of the century to exchange their old bills. A3

U.S. Suspends Bosnia ContactThe Clinton Administration announced it would suspend its contacts with Bosnia's Ambassador to the United States. The major European countries have done the same, after Bosnia's three-member presidency in Sarajevo failed to agree upon and name ambassadors capable of representing Bosnia's Muslims, Croats and Serbs. Agreeing upon the diplomatic appointments was required by the Dayton peace accords that ended the civil war. A3

Israel Halts Revenue TransferThe Israeli Government suspended reimbursement of taxes and other fees owed to the Palestinian Authority. The fees account for the majority of the Palestinian Authority's annual revenue and represent a variety of taxes collected by Israel from Palestinians. Israeli officials acknowledged that the tactic violated the peace accord but said the funding could be restored if Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and his Government begin to crack down on Islamic militants. A8

Israeli officials believed the suicide bombers in last week's attack in Jerusalem belonged to the militant Islamic group Hamas but their identity remained a mystery. A8
74 Killed in Algerian MassacresA total of 74 Algerian villagers were killed in a new series of massacres in the Blida and Ain-Defla regions, local residents said. The killings occurred within hours of a call by President Liamine Zeroual for public ''vigilance'' in the wake of a series of bloody massacres attributed to Islamic extremists that have left more than 600 dead in the last two months.

NATIONAL A12-17
Panel Proposes Abolishing U.S. Immigration AgencyA Federal advisory panel has decided to recommend abolishing the embattled Immigration and Naturalization Service and assign its duties to other Government agencies in an effort to improve the nation's immigration system. The United States Commission on Immigration Reform is proposing that the Justice Department, the immigration service's parent agency, retain responsibility for controlling the border and removing illegal immigrants. The State Department, which now deals with visas at American embassies overseas, would handle immigration services and benefits, like citizenship requests. And the Labor Department, which now monitors wage and hour laws, would also enforce rules covering the hiring of foreign workers. A1

Medicare Poised for ReformThe budget bill awaiting President Clinton's signature includes two new health insurance options that give Medicare beneficiaries greater freedom to choose their doctors and hospitals, but it also exposes elderly patients to much higher costs. The options, which represent a radical departure from current Medicare policy, are likely to appeal to rugged individualists who resent Government interference with their medical care and can afford to pay more for it. A1

Impact of U.P.S. Strike FeltA strike by 185,000 members of the teamsters' union idled most of the familiar brown trucks of the United Parcel Service, slowing the movement of millions of packages and inconveniencing businesses and their customers across the country. A14

Weld Draws Renewed SupportThe White House said that it would ''go to the mat'' for William Weld to be Ambassador to Mexico but that it would not directly challenge the decision by Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to deny Mr. Weld a hearing. A17

Action Delayed on Tobacco DealPresident Clinton is likely to delay acting on the proposed $368.5 billion tobacco settlement proposal until after he returns next month from a two-week summer vacation, White House officials said. Mr. Clinton had originally been expected to indicate his position on the proposal before leaving on vacation at the end of next week. But the White House press secretary Michael D. McCurry said that even if Mr. Clinton received the recommendations of an Administration task force currently reviewing the plan, he was unlikely to announce his position on it until September. A16

Hostage Taker Kills HimselfA man took a former girlfriend hostage at the corporate headquarters of the Inland Container Corporation in Indianapolis, and then kept police officers at bay for three hours before killing himself as she ran down a hallway. The man, Ronald Lowe, 48, died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds after he told the police that he did not want to return to jail. (AP)

NEW YORK/REGION B1-7
School District Created For Hasidic Jews AgainThe New York State Legislature passed legislation that would create a special public school district for a small but influential community of Hasidic Jews in the village of Kiryas Joel. The United States Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals, New York State's highest court, have struck down two similar pieces of legislation, saying that those measures violated a key Constitutional principle that establishes the division between government and religion. A1

New Picture of SuspectsInvestigators retracing the steps of Ghazi Abu Mezer and Lafi Khalil, the two suspects in an alleged subway bombing plot, are increasingly mystified to discover that, rather than having shown strong religious or political convictions, they appear to be merely a pair of drifters and street hustlers. B1

Insurer Fights DisclosureThe Prudential Insurance Company agreed in a national class-action settlement several months ago to pay at least $410 million to policyholders deceived by its sales agents, but since then the company has quietly begun a legal fight to keep documents from customers who rejected the settlement.

Cowboys Coach ArrestedDallas Cowboys coach Barry Switzer was arrested after a loaded .38 caliber revolver was found in his carry-on baggage at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. The incident raises questions about Switzer's long-term future as coach. B11

Aboriginal Makes Track HistoryCathy Freeman of Australia became the first Aboriginal to win a major international track and field title, taking the quarter mile in 49.77 seconds at the world championships in Athens.

Direct Marketing for DrugsDozens of prescription drugs are now being marketed directly to consumers in an escalating blitz of magazine, newspaper and television advertisements. The campaigns have intrigued patients, startled doctors and left policy makers and regulatory agencies scrambling to catch up. C1

Nashville in New YorkThe conventional wisdom in Nashville is that New York, a stronghold of liberalism, single adults and ethnic cultures, is a tough market for country-music acts. But country-music star Garth Brooks is giving a concert in Central Park on Thursday night, and the buzz has it that a million people will attend. C9

BUSINESS DAY D1-20
HarperCollins to ReorganizeThe News Corporation announced it would take a $270 million charge against earnings in fiscal 1997 to revamp its HarperCollins unit. The company said the charge was largely for inventories of returned books and author advances for unprofitable books. The charge is one of the largest taken in the publishing industry. Contrary to recent rumors, company executives insisted the business was not for sale. D1

Columbia Names ExecutivesColumbia/HCA Healthcare named a former top executive with the Hospital Corporation of America as president and chief operating officer. The executive, Jack O. Bovender Jr., is a longtime colleague of Thomas F. Frist Jr., who last month was named chairman and chief executive of the giant health care company. The announcement finalizes a new management team intended to stabilize the company as it faces a growing criminal investigation. D2
