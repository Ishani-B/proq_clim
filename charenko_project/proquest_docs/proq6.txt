They may reject evidence of greenhouse gases, global warming and climate change, but lobbyists for the Multilateral Agreement on Investment live with us on a planet which obeys the laws of physics.
If the 29 industrialized countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development decide to sign on to MAI, those laws will condemn the Earth to an era of uninsured risk, heralded by floods in Manitoba and ice storms in Quebec.
Under MAI, a foreign corporation can sue governments if they pass laws limiting resource production from domestic corporate investments.
By joining MAI in May, Canada exposes all four levels of government to legal action for compensatory damages. Worse, a signatory state must give five years notice to withdraw, and then allow unregulated production rates of its domestic resources for a further 15 years.
Lobbyists at the Fraser Institute, the Vancouver-based corporate think-tank, justify this 20-year commitment to MAI with an error in logic.
They argue that industry production rates need not respect a theory of global warming because scientists cannot isolate and measure global temperature variations due to man-made factors.
But instead of collecting evidence for 20 years and then finding it is too late, we can prove global warming from first principles and take preventive action now.
A growing blanket of greenhouse gases is closing off the earth's atmosphere, allowing more of the sun's energy to enter than to escape.
The first law of thermodynamics tells us that energy is conserved so the atmosphere must get hotter. The second law tells us that the "disorder" of a closed system increases, so the earth must suffer more frequent and more extreme changes in its climate.
In what looks like a tactic to get MAI signed in May before the rest of the world wakes up, the Fraser Institute economists want scientists to collect an impossible body of evidence to prove a theory of global warming.
They say scientists must use physical laws to show the world that, if the blanket of greenhouse gases continues to grow, global warming, climate change and uninsured weather risks inevitably follow.
But confirmation of the laws is already staring us in the face.
The greenhouse gas blanket is growing thicker around the earth, trapping more heat. The first law of thermodynamics says the earth must be getting hotter, and the five years from 1992 to 1996 are the hottest on record, as noted by Wayne Grady, author of The Quiet Limit of the World.
The second law says the disorder of a closed atmospheric system must increase.
Designed to withstand the historic weather patterns for Canada, infrastructures in Manitoba and Quebec have crumbled under the impact of floods and ice storms into billion-dollar catastrophes for the insurance industry.
Scientists can now prove what corporate ideologists will deny for lack of evidence: MAI will accelerate resource production, with attendant greenhouse gases.
The incriminated gas blanket will get thicker, faster. The earth will get hotter, the climate more violent and there will not be enough money to fix things when they break.
Industrialized states are poised to guarantee foreign corporations at least 20 years unregulated production of their domestic resources, including fossil fuels.
If they sign MAI, we enter an era of increased emissions, global warming, catastrophic climate change, bankrupt insurance companies and the loss of weather-related insurance cover for both foreign corporate investors and local community taxpayers.
Weather news across North America and around the world gives us proof of global warming, climate change and the era of uninsured risk, so let's stop trying to prove a theory for rejection by the "free market."
Citizens and voters must tell their governments to reject MAI and switch substantial resources into energy conservation and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
We will face MAI in May, at high noon under a hot sun.

The Prairies are home to hundreds of thousands of shallow potholes and wetlands that provide critical habitat for millions of shorebirds, ducks, and geese, which in turn are an important food source for predators. Droughts are a fact of life on the Prairies regardless of greenhouse gas emissions. A serious drought generally strikes the Prairies once every 30 to 50 years.

Disease and habitat loss will take a major toll on the millions of birds and animals that make use of the Prairies if the climate warms as predicted, says a study commissioned by the World Wildlife Fund.
The year-long study commissioned scientists to use sophisticated computer modeling programs to simulate potential changes in the environment based on the rise in greenhouse gases.
Predictive studies on climate change have been done before, but this one was somewhat unique in that it focused on the impact on vegetation and habitat.
University of Toronto scientist Jay Markham says such changes can be predicted by looking at climactic conditions that favor different types of plants and then comparing them with the various climate scenarios in the future.
"Whichever scenario you use, and there are a number of them out there," says Markham, "the end result is that the Prairies end up being particularly hard hit."
Markham says he was initially surprised by the findings which he arrived at with Adam Malcolm of World Wildlife Fund International in Washington.
"I thought that we would see the tree line rising quickly up the Rocky Mountains," he says. "And that is the case. But the pace of change on the Prairies was most pronounced."
Looked at more closely, the results aren't so difficult to explain, says Malcolm.
The Prairies are home to hundreds of thousands of shallow potholes and wetlands that provide critical habitat for millions of shorebirds, ducks, and geese, which in turn are an important food source for predators.
Even under so-called normal conditions, the slightest variation in precipitation and temperatures can significantly alter the size of these wetlands in a given year.
"Many kinds of migratory birds take shelter in temporary marshes that form on the prairie early in the year," says Malcolm.
"As the climate warms, these marshes will dry up earlier. Farmers will be tempted to use these dry conditions to cultivate earlier. And this will force birds to fly farther north for acceptable nesting sites."
While prairie birds and animals are conditioned to adapt to, and rebound from years of drought, it is believed that many species have already been pushed to the brink over the past century by agricultural development and the more than 700 prairie dams and irrigation reservoirs that have obstructed or dried up waterways.
Any trend towards further warming will likely dry up many of these potholes and wetlands altogether, irrespective of the fact that global change may bring more precipitation, says Malcolm.
Droughts are a fact of life on the Prairies regardless of greenhouse gas emissions. A serious drought generally strikes the Prairies once every 30 to 50 years.
The most severe drought of the past 500 years occurred on the prairie between 1791 and 1800.
The last significant drought in 1988 led to net income losses for farmers that reached as high as 78 per cent in Saskatchewan. More than $1.3 billion in drought, crop insurance and special drought assistance was paid out to mitigate the damages that occurred that year.
The World Wildlife Fund study falls into line with many of the predictions of Environment Canada.
Scientists asked by the department to look at global warming scenarios are predicting warmer temperatures, generally drier conditions and less severe winters for the Prairies.
Some of those scientists warn that average potential crop yields on the Prairies may fall by 10 to 30 per cent unless new crop varieties are developed.
While good planning and the development of drought-resistant crops can mitigate the damage to agriculture, the same does not hold true for the natural habitat upon which birds and wildlife depend, says Tim Goos of Environment Canada.
"You may be able to plant a crop earlier or irrigate more in the hot month of August if you're a farmer worried about yields, but there's not much that can be done when the duck ponds dry up and the vegetation is scarce."

Secretarial: Chasing the dragon Life's anything but dull at Earthwatch, writes Gina Bryant

Abstract: `I went to Komodo Island in August, with a group of teachers who had won fellowships,' 28-year-old Roscrow recalls. `We lived with the local villagers and each day worked with scientists, trapping the lizards and taking blood samples for DNA analysis. I was terrified before I went. Komodo dragons can be as much as three metres long and they are very fast runners. But, unless antagonised, they usually ignore you.' The dragons were caught in traps built by the volunteers and fitted with radio collars so they could be tracked through the forest. `It was disconcerting standing beside this hissing monster, rattling its head against the trap.' As fellowships officer, Roscrow organises the applications that flood in for the Millennium Fellowships Programme, handles enquiries and issues briefing packs. The programme, funded to the tune of pounds 1.4 million by the Lottery, gives teachers the chance to join field projects overseas during school holidays. Participants might study forests in Bohemia, devastated by acid rain, monitor climate change in Iceland, or help to save the endangered Komodo dragon.

Full text: Lynne Roscrow has an admin job with a difference. In her first year with the environmental charity Earthwatch Institute, she has been to a remote island in Indonesia to track the monster of the reptile world - the Komodo dragon.
`I went to Komodo Island in August, with a group of teachers who had won fellowships,' 28-year-old Roscrow recalls. `We lived with the local villagers and each day worked with scientists, trapping the lizards and taking blood samples for DNA analysis. I was terrified before I went. Komodo dragons can be as much as three metres long and they are very fast runners. But, unless antagonised, they usually ignore you.' The dragons were caught in traps built by the volunteers and fitted with radio collars so they could be tracked through the forest. `It was disconcerting standing beside this hissing monster, rattling its head against the trap.' As fellowships officer, Roscrow organises the applications that flood in for the Millennium Fellowships Programme, handles enquiries and issues briefing packs. The programme, funded to the tune of pounds 1.4 million by the Lottery, gives teachers the chance to join field projects overseas during school holidays. Participants might study forests in Bohemia, devastated by acid rain, monitor climate change in Iceland, or help to save the endangered Komodo dragon.
Last year, Earthwatch sent 185 lecturers, teachers, zoo education officers and country rangers to projects around the world. With 166 more volunteers receiving the news later this month that they have won a place, Roscrow has had a lot of people to look after.
`We've got an excellent `sign-up' database,' she says. `I can keep control of where everyone is going and when, their insurance details, travel costs and personal action plans.' She also has to sort out flight details for each person and confirm hotel bookings. Her busy office has even felt the effect of El Nino: `Last year, we had to cancel the field trip to Ecuador at the last minute and find everyone places on other projects.' Encountering a different culture in Indonesia had as much an impact on Roscrow as taking part in scientific research. `We were pushed to the limits in the field. It was hot, hard work, and you're surrounded by people who don't understand you. I learnt a lot about tolerance and team-building.' Back in the office, the experience is paying dividends. `I deal better with work colleagues, new situations and deadlines,' she says.
Roscrow, from Inverness, began her career with Our Price Records, where she was promoted to store manager. `I learnt organisational and management skills and a lot about customer care, but after eight years I was desperate for a break from retail.' She spent seven months travelling around the US. Back in Scotland, she signed up with a temp agency. `I arrived in jeans and they said they had just the job for me. It turned out to be very boring work in a grimy garage.' Already a keen member of Earthwatch, Roscrow sent in her CV to the organisation in the hope that there might be a job going. A month later, she was invited for interview and in February last year joined the charity's offices in Oxford.
The job is the first to offer her true satisfaction. `There's a hell of a lot of admin, and it's difficult trying to allocate the right people on to the right project. But to me, this is an admin job with a purpose. Even though I'm behind the scenes, I recognise the part I'm playing. I'm giving teachers a chance to be motivated and take that motivation back to the classroom.'

House panel OKs $8.5 million in farm aid // The money is earmarked for Minnesota's northwest, where five years of harsh weather and poor crops have taken a toll.: [METRO Edition]

Abstract: Emergency state assistance of $8.5 million for northwest Minnesota farmers struggling with five years of poor crops was approved Thursday by the House Ways and Means Committee. Only Minority Leader Steve Sviggum, R-Kenyon, dissented on a 20-1 vote to send to the House floor a bill sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim, DFL-Kennedy. Sviggum, a farmer in southeastern Minnesota, argued that the state cannot insulate farms from natural cycles of weather, crop disease and market prices. All of those factors have saddled wheat and barley farmers in Minnesota's remote northwest corner with catastrophic long-term losses that federal crop insurance has been inadequate to cover, said Sen. LeRoy Stumpf, DFL-Thief River Falls.

All of those factors have saddled wheat and barley farmers in Minnesota's remote northwest corner with catastrophic long-term losses that federal crop insurance has been inadequate to cover, said Sen. LeRoy Stumpf, DFL-Thief River Falls.
"This is an aberration," testified Rob Running, a farmer near Kennedy. "It's unrivaled by any other crop problem in the Northern Hemisphere over the last 10 years. It's affecting so many producers over such a long term."
Scab fungus and other wet-cycle diseases have beaten down yields of the small grains that are the area's economic mainstay. Meanwhile, worldwide bumper crops have hammered market prices for the same commodities, said Agriculture Commissioner Gene Hugoson.
Under Tunheim's bill, hard-pressed wheat and barley farmers in 11 counties could receive as much as $4,000 apiece to defray crop insurance premiums, which have been rising in cost and declining in coverage as yields have sagged. The counties covered are Beltrami, Clearwater, Kittson, Lake of the Woods, Mahnomen, Marshall, Norman, Pennington, Polk, Red Lake and Roseau.
Money for the assistance would come from the state's projected $1.9 billion budget surplus, but Hugoson said Gov. Arne Carlson hasn't yet decided whether to support the assistance plan.
"After the budget process is done, we'll see how it fits in," Hugoson said. "There's no guarantee the governor will sign, but he won't necessarily veto it, either. We're willing to work with the Legislature."
So far, research hasn't found a remedy for wheat scab, and it has spread to at least 12 states, Hugoson said.
"We have to look at more crop diversity up there, perhaps bringing livestock back into the area," he said. "We don't know whether it's a weather aberration or a climate change."
The assistance "won't make a difference whether people make it or not," Hugoson added. "But it would show people in the northwest corner that they're not forgotten."
Congress also is moving to help farmers. Senate and House versions of a broader appropriations bill would increase the Agriculture Department's lending authority. The loans are intended to keep farmers in business if they can't get credit from private lenders.
"This is not the complete answer, but it will at least enable people to continue to go on," Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said Thursday.

North Carolina seems to brag at its regulation of bail bondsmen, but I doubt (the house's occupant) would say the Department of Insurance or the Police Department are adding to his sense of security.
It's about freedom and private property rights, you all.

Wrong gases
EDITOR: I would like to point out a discrepancy between one of your headlines and the Associated Press news story that appeared on the front page on March 5.
The headline "Costs of ozone pact at $110 per home" was connected to a story about the costs that may be associated with compliance with the international agreement generally referred to as the Kyoto Protocol.
However, the Kyoto Protocol is not aimed at reducing ozone depletion ... (Its) goal is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
Confusion between human-induced greenhouse warming and ozone depletion is common ... They are, however, distinctly different phenomena.
The concern with ozone is related to the prediction ... and the well-documented observation that certain man-made chemicals cause a depletion of ozone in the Earth's upper atmosphere. This has led to an international agreement, the Montreal Protocols, phasing out the production of a variety of ozone-depleting chemicals.
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas (a gas that absorbs the infrared radiation the Earth emits back to space) and is thus related to concerns about global climate change. Many scientists think that increasing carbon dioxide abundance in the lower part of the atmosphere will lead to an increase in the Earth's average temperature and ... the distribution of climatic conditions. ...
Hence, the headline should have been "Costs of carbon dioxide pact at $110 per home."

Money problem
EDITOR: Ever since their leaders, Bill and Al, got caught with their hands in the cookie jar of illegal money, the Dems have tried to switch the theme from the crime to the cause.
All we hear from them is that the great god money is ruining the country and making honest politicians into crooks. And how it is time to have real reform which translates to "let's pass another law that will be ignored, but will be good touchy feely Pabulum ...
Money is not the problem. Not knowing who is buying our politicians is the problem. That is easy to solve. Adopt the following rules that I first read a few weeks ago written by George Will.
No limit on contributions. No cash contributions, checks only. No money from any foreign source. No contributions later than one week prior to the election. Full disclosure to the media at least weekly with a complete summary one week prior to the election. Last, but not least, any violation voids the election and the money must be returned.
With that information we should be able to decide if we agree with who is making the contributions. At least then we will know our views will be considered. ...

No cigar
EDITOR: In March 18th's paper the battleship announced a "Light up for cigar dinner," offering "Food, Wine and Cigars under the Stars". ...
What a hoot! I guess "Mouth and Throat Cancer Under the Stars" wouldn't sell.

It's a mess
EDITOR: The urge to comment on the present sordid state of affairs in our nation's capital is too strong and I must give in.
First, on the president's so-called approval rating: There is a myth that exists in the land, which is that if the economy is doing well, then the president and the administration are responsible. Why? Because it happened on their watch. ...
Second, the idea that all these people are out to get President Clinton is preposterous. Prior to the '96 election that might have been true, but now it's just a matter of time and he's gone. The man is a lame duck.
Why would the right-wing conspiracy (if there is one) waste time on a president who couldn't accomplish anything even when he had a Democratic majority in both houses of Congress?
Third, we have heard from Ms. Flowers, Ms. Jones, Ms. Lewinski and Ms. Willey; how about the seven others who were referred to in the Willey deposition? Maybe one of them isn't lying, because it seems everyone else is, all except Slick Willy.

Mary's a hussy
EDITOR: I can't resist it. First off, Jump Start is good, black and white, non-denominational.
Secondly, Shoe is for all us old folks. Please.
Thirdly, I feel sorry for Mary Worth, in that she feels it necessary to lie to her doctor friend, telling him she has never been married. How soon she forgets, like only 60 years or so ago, when Apple Mary had to work so hard selling apples to keep her "Grandson" Denis? Hussy!
Please keep us smiling.

History shared
EDITOR: I'm writing in response to the Feb. 17 letter "White history." What a bold statement from a person who has not taken the time to look back in history to find out why.
For decades, white people have tried to reconvert my people: Not only do we have the month of February to celebrate black history, but in my opinion, black history is not recognized enough.
If it were left up to me, black history would be celebrated from January through December. My people are due that respect, and more.
Your race took my people's land away and made them slaves. ... You have had your history for years and decades. It's my people's turn to be noticed.
Black history should affect you in a positive way, not a negative way. Live and learn your history. When we look at it, we all are a part of the same history, like it or not.

DSS neglected
EDITOR: If I read your Feb. 23 report correctly, it seems that our Republican County Commissioners' only reason for scrimping on the DSS staff is a mindless, ideological knee-jerk reaction against increase in government.
Never mind that the social services professionals in Raleigh consider the caseload excessive. Never mind that state and federal funds would be provided to cover 75 percent of the needed staff. Never mind that the other 25 percent is already available from existing DSS funds. Never mind the human problems caused by extended delay in dealing with cases of abuse, neglect and troubled youth.
... In a growing county, it is reasonable to expect that required government services will also grow. If our Republican commissioners don't want to be problem-solvers, maybe they should do something else with their spare time.

Full text: Margaret Speedie sat on deck as a Russian explorer carefully put stitches in a gash in her lip. Her normally carefully-groomed hair was caked rigid with salt from days of sea-water showers, and as she looked up she saw icebergs floating past.
For the West Lothian mother-of two who had never travelled further than Majorca it was a moment to cherish - despite the pain from her wound.
The 50-year-old insurance firm worker had been injured falling through a hatch on the ocean-going yacht she shared with six complete strangers.
Her adventure in the wilderness came after she joined explorer Robert Swan's Mission Antarctica expedition.
Intrepid though she is, Margaret doesn't fit the traditional image of a Polar explorer.
She lives in a small, modern terraced house in Bathgate with her machine operator husband Bobby. She is the kind of jolly mum who jokes that their son Barry, 23, and daughter Diane, 20, take as much looking after now as they did when they were two-year-olds.
And she has a job she enjoys, as a call centre operator with Edinburgh insurance giant Standard Life.
Things such as penguin colonies, yacht voyages and the effects of pollution on the polar ice caps have, until now, featured little in her life.
Still less the drastic first aid from Dr Misha Malakhov, a veteran polar explorer, after her fall through the deck hatch.
Margaret - propelled by a nagging sense that there was more to life out there -won sponsorship from her firm to join Mission Antarctica, a programme set up to assess the amount of man-made junk spoiling the wilderness and gather support for an international clean-up operation.
For three weeks, on board the 52ft yacht Pelagic, her life was turned upside down. Now, back home, she admits she still feels "not quite with it."
The thrown-together crew included Misha, skipper Hamish Laird and a member of the Scottish Polar Research Institute, Finlo Cottier. The Polar newcomers included computer company worker Peter Galesloot and colleague Gaynor Finlay, and Lisa Cusack, a private health firm worker from London.
Says Margaret: "When we first sat down together at Gatwick airport I thought, 'We are going to be OK.'
"It was obvious from the start there were no egos, which was a good basis for setting out on a trip like ours.
"I think it was a really special time for all of us. "What we have shared is something we will never forget.
"It was hard work but we had relaxing times. There were a lot of fun moments. There was no friction among the crew, no dirt to dish," says Margaret.
Their work started on King George Island, a barren, rocky "quarry" of place on the edge of Antarctica, where 30 years-worth of discarded exploration hardware litters the landscape.
Mission Antarctica hopes data collected by Margaret and the team will be used to organise a clean-up.
The Pelagic began its journey into Antarctica with a 12 hour sail through the Gerlache Straits to the rugged volcanic landscape of Deception Island, a former whaling station still dotted with the remains of huge vats used to boil up valuable blubber.
With Pelagic moored in a sheltered bay, trips ashore were by inflatable Zodiac dinghy.
"I used muscles I never though I had getting in and out of that dinghy," says Margaret.
"Everything seemed strange. We washed up in salt water so everything tasted of salt and we showered in salt water.
"My scalp was encrusted in salt. Meals came from a whole lamb that was strung up from the rigging." As they sailed further south, mooring at various remote points on the coast, signs of human activity on the continent were replaced by the sight of seals and penguin colonies.
The penguins displayed a side to their character that no David Attenborough documentary could - their smell.
For every group huddled in a circle there was an even bigger circle of stinking penguin droppings nearby.
And, as icebergs were sighted towering out of the water, the crew were introduced to what seasoned Antarctica hands knowingly call "Kodak country".
"The snow and ice are full of luminous neon colours. You need sunglasses or you are blinded by it all.
"Sometimes it felt a bit overwhelming that I was actually there. It was very emotional at times.
"We were sailing through ice- bergs, which was a peculiar feeling in such a small yacht, but we were glad we were able to get to areas where a bigger boat just could not have gone.
"You feel as if you are almost beamed into a different planet, it did not seem to be part of this world of ours.
"I can't describe it. It made a big impression on the whole team," says Margaret.
The crew were able to investigate a "ghost" survey station at Danco Point, abandoned by the British Antarctic Survey in the 1950s and still stocked with tinned food from the time.
Human contact was resumed at the journey's southernmost point Vernadsky base, a former British outpost now home to a Ukrainian scientific team. It offered creature comforts - a long hot shower and an evening out in the bar.
"I played pool for the first time in my life. I was hopeless," says Margaret.
Before they began the four-day sail back towards Cape Horn, the crew called at Port Lockroy - the world's most remote Post Office. They sent postcards home from the tiny base that is home to hundreds of thousands of penguins and just two scientists who are posted there every summer to study the birds.
For days e-mail communication with home was cut by a power failure, forcing the crew to abandon their hectic schedule of report- sending, but bringing them closer as a team.
As the 600-mile voyage back to Cape Horn and civilisation got underway, a feeling of anti-climax set in.
Margaret, who is booked into a string of talks for Standard Life, schools and community groups, will meet up with the crew again in London later this month to swap tales of their adventure.
"Whether it has changed me remains to be seen. "I still feel not quite with it," she adds.
Following in Scott's footsteps EXPLORER Robert Swan, 41, was the first man to walk to both North and South poles.
His life is the story of his obsession with the earth's last great wildernesses which began when he watched John Mills' famous film of Scott of the Antarctic as an 11-year-old boy.
Starting as a penniless student he spent seven years raising the cash to follow in Scott's footsteps.
He was 28 when he stood at the South Pole with two other explorers, having walked there using low-tech equipment that would have been recognised by members of Scott's ill-fated 1930 expedition. Four years later, in 1989, he led a seven-strong team on a walk to the North Pole.
Ever since then he has worked to give others the chance to experience the icy wildnernesses - and generate as much publicity about the potentially disastrous threats he believes they face from pollution and climate change.
His London-based company One Step Beyond has organised trips to both Poles for young people from around the world.
This year it launched Mission Antarctica - the programme that Margaret Speedie joined.
Backed by corporate sponsors, who stump up GBP 15,000 to send an employee, new teams will follow in Margaret's footsteps each summer. The aim is to plan a clean-up of the Russian Bellinghaussen base on King George Island in the year 2000.
A One Step Beyond spokeswoman said: "It is all about taking people from commerce and industry to this remote place to inspire them and to make as many people as possible aware of what is going on there."

Seeing red over Brown's green stance Debate

Abstract: LAST week's Budget was unforgivable. At a stroke, Gordon Brown broke the Government's manifesto promise to put "the environment at the heart of policymaking", and ground into the dirt his frequently repeated pledges to use the tax system to protect the environment, make the polluter pay and be fair to future generations. The tokenistic measures on public transport, cleaner fuels and energy efficiency will not combat climate change, end exhaust pollution that kills up to 24,000 people a year, nor reduce the damage done by quarrying, pesticides, water polluters or builders to the green belt. Elevating Sir Colin Marshall, former chairman of British Airways, to head a panel of industrialists to investigate energy taxes is like putting King Herod in charge of child care. Aviation lobbyists have fought long and hard to ensure that, as one of the worst contributors to climate change, the industry pays no green taxes.

Full text: LAST week's Budget was unforgivable. At a stroke, Gordon Brown broke the Government's manifesto promise to put "the environment at the heart of policymaking", and ground into the dirt his frequently repeated pledges to use the tax system to protect the environment, make the polluter pay and be fair to future generations.
The tokenistic measures on public transport, cleaner fuels and energy efficiency will not combat climate change, end exhaust pollution that kills up to 24,000 people a year, nor reduce the damage done by quarrying, pesticides, water polluters or builders to the green belt.
Elevating Sir Colin Marshall, former chairman of British Airways, to head a panel of industrialists to investigate energy taxes is like putting King Herod in charge of child care. Aviation lobbyists have fought long and hard to ensure that, as one of the worst contributors to climate change, the industry pays no green taxes.
The problem is that Treasury ministers, at heart, don't believe green taxes work. Labour backbenchers mutter darkly about regressive impacts on the poor. The all-powerful Number 10 Policy Unit is actively antagonistic to environmental action, believing it anti-industry.
Greening the tax system makes sense. Much more sense than the traditional stupidity of penalising employment and earnings, which both economists and people like, through high taxes, while rewarding pollution and waste which everyone dislikes with very low or no taxes.
Green taxes work. When Sweden introduced a tax on acid rain pollution, emissions fell by over 30 per cent.
Until Gordon Brown taxes industrial and domestic fuels on carbon content, the Prime Minister cannot deliver his vital commitment to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent by 2010. In our newly liberalised energy market, consumers may shop around for a clean, renewable supply.
Charges made on environmental damage provide an incentive for continuous commercial improvement. Business invests in technologies and management practices which reduce pollution and resource consumption. Operating costs fall, and companies become more efficient and competitive.
Domestic markets open up for environmental equipment, encouraging others to innovate and invent. With a secure base at home, UK firms can compete in the growing global market for environmental technologies. The OECD estimates that demand will be worth some $300 billion by 2000. Today, Japanese, American and German firms grab the lion's share.
It is fair that polluters should pay more. It is also right that consumers are rewarded for being environmentally virtuous. Belgium has cut VAT on energy-saving materials from 22 per cent to 6 per cent, and made drivers of gas-guzzlers pay pounds 1,000 more in road tax than fuel-efficient car owners.
Mr Brown trimmed a paltry pounds 50 off road tax for fuel-efficient drivers, and kept VAT at 17.5 per cent on energy-saving materials for home-owners. No incentive to go green there.
Backbench opposition to green taxes in the name of the poor is misguided. The present tax system guarantees that poor people suffer most from environmental degradation. Making polluters pay and targeting revenues is the best way of raising living standards and quality of life for the disadvantaged.
Friends of the Earth ran its Budget package of energy, pollution and resource taxes through a Cambridge Econometrics forecasting model used by the Treasury. Over 12 years, they generate revenues of pounds 27 billion and reduce climate change pollution by one third. Re-using the money to reduce industry's National Insurance contributions by 3 per cent generates 391,000 new jobs.
Sectors such as retailing, banking, hotels, insurance, food, electronics, textiles and communications, which account for 70 per cent of UK exports and 60 per cent of jobs, benefit the most.
The Government has other options on how to spend the polluter-pays money to meet economic and social as well as environmental goals. Why not ensure that the poor are protected from price increases on essentials like energy and water through a generously set base-use that is free, with extravagant use charged by the unit?
Or use carbon tax revenues on a home energy conservation programme targeting the 15 million people too poor to stay warm in winter - and end the scandal of 30,000 deaths annually from cold and damp while stimulating up to 50,000 jobs.
Opinion polls show that people are willing to pay environmental taxes, particularly when revenues are spent on further reducing environmental problems. Taxes that work, are moral and popular - what more does it take for Mr Brown to go green?
Charles Secrett is director of Friends of the Earth. These personal opinions do not necessarily reflect the policy of that organisation.

Full text: Disease and habitat loss will take a major toll on the millions of birds and animals that make use of the Prairies if the climate warms as predicted, says a study commissioned by the World Wildlife Fund.
The year-long study commissioned scientists to use sophisticated computer modeling programs to simulate potential changes in the environment based on the rise in greenhouse gases.
Predictive studies on climate change have been done before, but this one was somewhat unique in that it focused on the impact on vegetation and habitat.
University of Toronto scientist Jay Markham says such changes can be predicted by looking at climatic conditions that favour different types of plants and then comparing them with the various climate scenarios in the future.
"Whichever scenario you use, and there are a number of them out there," says Markham, "the end result is that the Prairies end up being particularly hard hit."
Malcolm says he was initially surprised by the findings which he arrived at with Adam Markham of World Wildlife Fund International in Washington.
"I thought that we would see the treeline rising quickly up the Rocky Mountains," he says. "And that is the case. But the pace of change on the Prairies was most pronounced."
Looked at more closely, the results aren't so difficult to explain, says Malcolm.
The Prairies are home to hundreds of thousands of shallow potholes and wetlands that provide critical habitat for millions of shorebirds, ducks, and geese, which in turn are an important food source for predators.
Even under so-called normal conditions, the slightest variation in precipitation and temperatures can significantly alter the size of these wetlands in a given year.
"Many kinds of migratory birds take shelter in temporary marshes that form on the prairie early in the year," says Malcolm.
"As the climate warms, these marshes will dry up earlier. Farmers will be tempted to use these dry conditions to cultivate earlier. And this will force birds to fly farther north for acceptable nesting sites."
While prairie birds and animals are conditioned to adapt to, and rebound from years of drought, it is believed that many species have already been pushed to the brink over the past century by agricultural development and the more than 700 prairie dams and irrigation reservoir that have obstructed or dried up waterways.
Any trend towards further warming will likely dry up many of these potholes and wetlands altogether, irrespective of the fact that global change may bring more precipitation, says Malcolm.
Droughts are a fact of life on the Prairies regardless of greenhouse gas emissions. A serious drought generally strikes the Prairies once every 30 to 50 years.
The most severe drought of the past 500 years occurred on the prairie between 1791 and 1800.
The last significant drought in 1988 led to net income losses for farmers that reached as high as 78 per cent in Saskatchewan. More than $1.3 billion in drought, crop insurance and special drought assistance was paid out to mitigate the damages that occurred that year.
The World Wildlife Fund study falls into line with many of the predictions of Environment Canada.
Scientists asked by the department to look at global warming scenarios are predicting warmer temperatures, generally drier conditions and less severe winters for the Prairies.
Some of those scientists warn that average potential crop yields on the Prairies may fall by 10 to 30 per cent unless new crop varieties are developed.
While good planning and the development of drought-resistant crops can mitigate the damage to agriculture, the same does not hold true for the natural habitat upon which birds and wildlife depend, says Tim Goos of Environment Canada.
"You may be able to plant a crop earlier or irrigate more in the hot month of August if you're a farmer worried about yields, but there's not much that can be done when the duck ponds dry up and the vegetation is scarce."

Abstract: Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's call last weekend to independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr to wrap things up sparked a Republican nervous breakdown. But Lott, after talking to cooler heads like House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), got back on message and blamed President Clinton for dragging things out. Still, Lott wasn't hallucinating: Starr may give some Republicans their fondest dream, a Clinton impeachment. But if Starr doesn't move quickly, he may also end up giving them their worst imaginable nightmare: 10 years of Al Gore as president. So if Clinton is forced out in the next few months, Gore takes over and can only run once. But if Clinton hangs in there until Jan. 20, 1999, there's not only the problem of Gore running as an incumbent, but also the risk that Gore could be president for more years than any president since FDR.

Full text: Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's call last weekend to independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr to wrap things up sparked a Republican nervous breakdown. But Lott, after talking to cooler heads like House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), got back on message and blamed President Clinton for dragging things out.
Still, Lott wasn't hallucinating: Starr may give some Republicans their fondest dream, a Clinton impeachment. But if Starr doesn't move quickly, he may also end up giving them their worst imaginable nightmare: 10 years of Al Gore as president.
Loop Fans will recall that the 22nd Amendment -- ratified in 1951 to stop any more Democratic presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt from being elected to a third or fourth term -- says no one can be elected more than twice. And "no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president" can be elected more than once.
So if Clinton is forced out in the next few months, Gore takes over and can only run once. But if Clinton hangs in there until Jan. 20, 1999, there's not only the problem of Gore running as an incumbent, but also the risk that Gore could be president for more years than any president since FDR.
4% Think Gore Was Downsized
Meanwhile, Gore still has his work cut out for him. Even though he has taken credit for government downsizing -- 350,000 federal jobs have been eliminated since he took office -- it appears the public hasn't gotten the message yet.
A new survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 35 percent of Americans think the number of people employed by the government has increased, while 27 percent think it has stayed the same over the last three years. Thirty-four percent have heard Gore's message, saying they believe the federal work force has decreased.
Accounting for Appointees
And speaking of Gore's great work cutting the number of jobs, here's a quick quiz: What types of jobs have not been cut?
Okay, maybe that was too easy. Yes, the number of political appointees has stayed pretty much where it's been the last 10 years.
In September 1987, there were 2,801 political appointees in the federal government. Last September there were actually a few more, 2,887. On the other hand, there were as many as 3,495 getting paid in September 1991.
Shell Shock
Interior Department folks deal with paper, not real wildlife. But on Monday morning, official Robert K. Hattoy walked into his office and found a gray pigeon sitting on the floor by his filing cabinet.
The bird, it turns out, was sitting on an egg and cooing at a second egg next to it. Seems Hattoy had left a window open on Friday and the bird made itself at home over the weekend.
Other departments might have dealt with the situation differently, but because this is Interior, getting rid of the bird and eggs was a delicate matter.
The Fish and Wildlife Service was called in and they moved the pigeon and eggs to safety. A relieved Hattoy said: "As a federal employee I was trying not to violate the Hatch Act." Well, sometimes you soar with eagles, other times . . .
Castro to Head EEOC
Funny thing happened on Labor Department official Ida Castro's way to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee hearing today. Castro, a former New Jersey lawyer and law professor who's been acting head of the department's Women's Bureau, was to attend a hearing on her recent nomination to run the bureau.
Not gonna happen. Castro instead is going to be nominated shortly by Clinton to chair the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. At least it's the same committee.
Enough Chairs for a Quartet
Just when you thought the Securities and Exchange Commission was going to be getting up to full speed with all five players, commissioner Paul R. Carey is going to be off for the next few months. He has missed recent meetings and is in New York City getting treatments for a "curable" form of cancer, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said yesterday during a commission meeting. Carey, son of former New York governor Hugh L. Carey, is expected to be out at least 10 weeks, Levitt said.
The 1600 Club
John Yarowsky -- now in the White House counsel's office doing judicial nominations and other matters and former general counsel to House Judiciary -- is to be partner at Patton Boggs. Mark B. Childress -- now general counsel for the Environmental Working Group and former counsel to Senate Labor Committee -- becomes senior counsel for nominations, handling judicial and nonjudicial nominations.
White House staff secretary Todd Stern, who's really running the administration's climate change initiative, is going to be doing that job officially, working with CEQ, CEA, OSTP, NEC, NSC and other relevant executive agencies. Deputy staff secretary Phillip Caplan moves up to staff secretary.
Catching Up . . .
Clinton has nominated intellectual property lawyer Q. Todd Dickinson to be deputy assistant secretary of commerce and deputy commissioner of patents and trademarks. Peggy Ellis, director of government affairs at the Cato Institute, has moved in as director of congressional and public affairs at the Republican National Committee.
Linda Ricci, former senior producer for economics at "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" and more recently in private PR work, is going public, taking over as OMB associate director for communications.

Fresh water tops environmental agenda

Abstract: Fresh water could be the key environmental issue of the future, according to the United Nation Environment Program's (UNEP) new executive director. Klaus Topfer, a former German environment minister, says that "The potential for conflict over the world's remaining freshwater resources is great. The decline in the supply of readily available freshwater raises the very real possibility of water wars' and this issue needs urgent political attention." As we all know, the Prairies are already sensitive to drought. Droughts occur every 30-50 years with great consequence. In the "Dirty '30s," for example, wheat yields declined 32 per cent, 200,000 farms failed and 300,000 people migrated from the southern prairies. In the 1988 drought, federal assistance alone cost $1.3 billion, but Saskatchewan net farm income still dropped by 78 per cent; about 10 per cent of farmers left the agriculture sector that year. Models indicate that global warming will result in higher temperatures and reductions in soil moisture for the prairies, and increased incidence of drought. In this scenario, average potential yields may fall by 10-30 per cent.

Full text: Fresh water could be the key environmental issue of the future, according to the United Nation Environment Program's (UNEP) new executive director. Klaus Topfer, a former German environment minister, says that "The potential for conflict over the world's remaining freshwater resources is great. The decline in the supply of readily available freshwater raises the very real possibility of water wars' and this issue needs urgent political attention."
An adequate supply of safe, clean water is considered the most important precondition for sustaining human life, for maintaining ecosystems that support all life, and for achieving sustainable development. Water demand is already being affected by the rise in population, the acceleration of per capita use, irrigation and power production. Meanwhile, supply is increasingly in question due to the global warming trend.
That is why freshwater politics and resources will be the focus of attention at several high level events this year. Environment ministers and senior government officials from around the world are currently focusing on this topic at the second meeting of the UNEP High-level Committee of Ministers and Officials in Nairobi. It will also be the focus of discussions at the forthcoming Commission on Sustainable Development meeting in New York in April.
Water supplies are a key concern of scientists researching the the impact of global climate change on the Canadian prairies. While water wars are unlikely in our context, significant economic and ecological disruptions are, according to Responding to Global Climate Change in the Prairies, a report published by Environment Canada.
As we all know, the Prairies are already sensitive to drought. Droughts occur every 30-50 years with great consequence. In the "Dirty '30s," for example, wheat yields declined 32 per cent, 200,000 farms failed and 300,000 people migrated from the southern prairies. In the 1988 drought, federal assistance alone cost $1.3 billion, but Saskatchewan net farm income still dropped by 78 per cent; about 10 per cent of farmers left the agriculture sector that year.
Models indicate that global warming will result in higher temperatures and reductions in soil moisture for the prairies, and increased incidence of drought. In this scenario, average potential yields may fall by 10-30 per cent.
According to the report, the option to increase irrigation may not be possible due to uncertain water supply. Crop choices and adaptation for drought has more potential, but only if accelerated R&D is supported.
Drought conditions also affect the northern forests. In 1988, insect infestations, higher seedling mortality and fire damage and suppression costs were key results. With global warming, we can expect significant shifts in forest productivity. "In general, the boreal forest is likely to decrease in area, biomass, and carbon stock, with a move toward younger age-classes and considerable disruption at its southern boundaries."
Other impacts of global waring in our region will include: increased energy consumption and decreased efficiency of power production as reservoir water temperatures increase; increased insurance premiums and health care costs; lower wildfowl populations as potholes dry up; and decreasing tourism potential as, for example, recreational fishing deteriorates.
Ironically, global warming could also cause increased precipitation, with more storms and greater stress on dams and water control structures, meaning more flooding.
In addition to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to reduce global warming, there are a number of mitigation efforts that can be made to ease the impact of climate change when it occurs.
- In agriculture, more research on moisture management and drought tolerance is needed.
- Forests can be managed to reduce fire impacts, replanting with more adaptive species, and better logging practices can be adopted to conserve soil and water resources.
- In the energy field, conservation and efficiency measures reduce demand, making future stress on energy supplies more manageable.
- The insurance industry can reduce investment in companies contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, and lobby for higher energy efficiency standards in building codes.
Finally, more measures are needed to increase the ability of regions and municipalities to share water resources equitably, based on a river basin approach.

Abstract: Premiums in the worst hit areas of the country - for example, parts of the storm-lashed south-west England -are already beginning to increase. The ABI confirmed that some properties with a particularly bad record of flood damage are being considered uninsurable and owners can be denied policies. Leading insurers told the previous government that it believed climate change - exacerbated, if not caused by human activity - was to blame for a fourfold increase in domestic insurance costs over the past 30 years. "Our climate is definitely changing, bringing more extreme weather, particularly during wetter and warmer winters," said Andrew Dlugolecki, the group assistant general manager for underwriting at General Accident and a committee member of the United Nations Environment Programme Insurance and Sustainable Growth Initiative. Richard Dixon, the head of research at Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: "It is absolutely crucial to have the insurance industry in this country talking the same language as environmentalists and recognising the threats of climate change.

Full text: STORM-damaged households in Britain received record payouts from insurance companies last year, figures will reveal later this month.
Returns from the industry for 1997 are still being collected but the Association of British Insurers predicts that the total of weather-related claims will top the GBP 500 million paid out in 1996 - itself twice the amount for 1995. The continued surge in the costs of storms, floods and the increasing frequency of freak weather will undoubtedly be raised with Government ministers - the insurance industry is already the leading business sector pressing for urgent action to tackle the causes of global warming.
"The total for 1997 will be worse than for the previous year principally because of the storms early last year, but not because of extreme cold weather," an ABI source said. "This year does not look as if it is likely to get any better - we have already had to pay out around GBP 300 million for the storms over Christmas and New Year." Figures obtained from Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary, confirm the upward trend in weather-related insurance payouts.
Last year the company, which has about a million domestic customers UK wide, paid GBP 27 million on claims of weather damaged property - damaged roofs, burst pipes and floods.
"This represents an 8 per cent increase on the previous year's figure. However, there were significant differences experienced between different types of claim," said a spokeswoman, Gill Murphy. "Storm-related claims were almost a third higher than in the previous year - largely due to January's storms - while burst pipe claims were down by around a third compared to the previous 12 months.
"It is extremely difficult to make any accurate predictions over future trends in weather-related claims. However, a great deal of volatility is inevitable due to changing weather patterns."
Premiums in the worst hit areas of the country - for example, parts of the storm-lashed south-west England -are already beginning to increase. The ABI confirmed that some properties with a particularly bad record of flood damage are being considered uninsurable and owners can be denied policies. Leading insurers told the previous government that it believed climate change - exacerbated, if not caused by human activity - was to blame for a fourfold increase in domestic insurance costs over the past 30 years. "Our climate is definitely changing, bringing more extreme weather, particularly during wetter and warmer winters," said Andrew Dlugolecki, the group assistant general manager for underwriting at General Accident and a committee member of the United Nations Environment Programme Insurance and Sustainable Growth Initiative. Richard Dixon, the head of research at Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: "It is absolutely crucial to have the insurance industry in this country talking the same language as environmentalists and recognising the threats of climate change.
"They are the first sector of commerce to see that climate change is going to alter completely the way they do business and people can see it can no longer be dismissed as the rantings of extremists." It has been argued that Scottish firms are already feeling the effects of climate change, including ski resorts grinding to a halt for lack of snow.

Abstract: "The environment is coming back as a top-of-mind issue," Doug Miller, president of Environics, told an Ottawa conference on climate change yesterday. The trend cuts across age groups, sexes and geographic regions. Sixty per cent of Canadians believe cuts to greenhouse-gas emissions (carbon dioxide from burning fuel) would hurt the economy today, he said. "That's a gut feeling of Canadians," he said. "What it suggests is that the Clinton administration's approach would resonate very favourably here. ... That is that we have to buy some insurance against future costs" by reducing our pollution, especially the "greenhouse gases" that threaten our climate.

Full text: ¬† Another "great green wave" is swelling in Canadian public opinion, just like the wave that made the environment the top issue of the late 1980s, says the head of a major polling firm.
"The environment is coming back as a top-of-mind issue," Doug Miller, president of Environics, told an Ottawa conference on climate change yesterday. The trend cuts across age groups, sexes and geographic regions.
And he said the public is demanding environmental protection today, despite its possible economic costs, to prevent environmental damage in the future.
"People have zero tolerance for further risk," Miller said. "They're saying: Let's err on the side of environmental caution, even if we have to pay an economic price."
Sixty per cent of Canadians believe cuts to greenhouse-gas emissions (carbon dioxide from burning fuel) would hurt the economy today, he said.
But 84 per cent believe doing nothing to reduce these emissions would hurt the economy in the future.
"That's a gut feeling of Canadians," he said. "What it suggests is that the Clinton administration's approach would resonate very favourably here. ... That is that we have to buy some insurance against future costs" by reducing our pollution, especially the "greenhouse gases" that threaten our climate.
Seventy-three per cent of those surveyed said they would choose environmental protection ahead of economic progress. That's up from 67 per cent six years ago.
"The important thing is that it's because they believe the two (a clean environment and a healthy economy) go together," Miller says. "They don't think it's a trade-off."
Miller was speaking at a conference on climate change organized by a federal advisory group, the National Round Table on the Environmental and the Economy.
Environics surveys Canadian opinions on a wide variety of environmental issues twice a year, and has done so for 10 years. A survey of this type, covering 1,500 adults, is considered accurate within 2.5 percentage points 19 times out of 20.
Miller said the growing wave has been evident for more than a year, and was confirmed by Environics' latest survey, just two weeks ago.
It's still under the surface, but growing, he said. He expects it to hit fully within four years, bringing a second era in which Canadians place the environment ahead of all other issues.
Why the change?
For one thing, the environment never really went away as an issue. People stopped listing it as their most important issue, he said, but still held on to it as a central element of faith.
By far the greatest issue on Canadians' minds is the quality of the air - not just where we live, but globally.
The thinning ozone layer is our top worry. "The ozone hole is as powerful an image to Canadians as the picture of the Earth from space."
Number two, but catching up, is climate change. But here there's still a lot of confusion.
"People believe the atmosphere is coming unravelled," Miller said. "Beyond that they don't have a lot of understanding what's going on."
Fo instance, a lot of people used to believe the thinning ozone layer was somehow causing the climate to change. That misunderstanding clung for years, but has finally started to disappear.
Then there's the recent Kyoto conference on reducing the gases that cause global warming. Asked two weeks ago what happened, 67 per cent cent either knew nothing about it or knew "very little." Another eight per cent were't sure what Canada had done, but believed our country did badly at the conference.
Just two per cent knew Canada had promised to cut greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide.
Still, he said, we're learning. We did measureably better on a series of questions about how climate change works. And 45 per cent said driving a car is the most environmentally damaging thing they do.
"We're calling the automobile the next blue box, the next area of focused public concern."

Disregarding environmentalism is misguided: [Final Edition]

Abstract: My initial reaction to Kip Beckman's Feb. 7 Insight article, in which he essentially dismisses environmentalists as Chicken Little's screaming about the falling sky, was to laugh in disbelief. In the grand finale, Beckman discards concern over global warming, which he glibly dubs "the mother of all environmental scares," based on a study of two chemists and on the past concern that the planet was moving in the opposite direction. Overwhelming scientific opinion is in accordance that human-induced climate change is occurring. Scientists who deny climate change tend to be funded by oil or other industries with strong interests in discrediting it. After presenting the rosy reality implied by his casual dismissal of food shortages, human population excess, energy problems, acid rain and global warming, Beckman boldly asserts the myths of environmentalists "can cause a lot of damage" while bringing "fame and money" to those promoting these myths. While he decries the self- interest of environmentalists, as an economist with the Conference Board of Canada, Beckman can hardly be considered an impartial observer.

Full text: Note
My initial reaction to Kip Beckman's Feb. 7 Insight article, in which he essentially dismisses environmentalists as Chicken Little's screaming about the falling sky, was to laugh in disbelief.
Beckman nonchalantly brushes off projections of food shortages as being "way off the mark," although nearly one-fifth of humanity goes to bed hungry every night, 20 million die malnourished every year and the global south cannot feed itself and requires massive food imports from the north.
He dismisses the persistent alarm of population explosion as having fizzled due to "low and tumbling fertility rates," in denial of the fact the population will not stop growing -- even with a decline in fertility rates --until it reaches between 8 and 10 billion. The doubling of the current human population can hardly be considered to be fizzling.
Beckman downplays the energy crisis and need to find alternative energy sources as though the currently "unexploited reserves" of oil and the tar shales will last forever, and as though there are no other impacts of a petroleum-dependent society.
He suggests the damaging impact of acid rain on European forests disappeared in the 1980s. Studies have shown major parts of Germany's famed Black Forest are now half as thick as they once were owing directly to acid rain, and there are more than 1,000 forest species in Scandinavia endangered by pollution and industrial forestry.
In the grand finale, Beckman discards concern over global warming, which he glibly dubs "the mother of all environmental scares," based on a study of two chemists and on the past concern that the planet was moving in the opposite direction. Overwhelming scientific opinion is in accordance that human-induced climate change is occurring. Scientists who deny climate change tend to be funded by oil or other industries with strong interests in discrediting it.
It is notable, in light of his dismissal that global climate change is not related to the recent ice storm, to find it is not only environmentalists who are making this connection. Steve Goldstein of the U.S. Insurance Information Institute recently said: "The insurance industry is very much aware of global warming, because of the top 10 disasters that have occurred in the history of the United States, nine of them have happened in the past six years."
After presenting the rosy reality implied by his casual dismissal of food shortages, human population excess, energy problems, acid rain and global warming, Beckman boldly asserts the myths of environmentalists "can cause a lot of damage" while bringing "fame and money" to those promoting these myths. While he decries the self- interest of environmentalists, as an economist with the Conference Board of Canada, Beckman can hardly be considered an impartial observer.
If he's truly concerned with revealing "fame and money" seekers who manipulate the environmental debate, he should look in the mirror and in the corporate boardrooms whose interests he is serving.
In assessing Beckman's perverse revision of insidious motives, recall a Native American philosophy which sought to organize society with the seventh unborn generation in mind, and then judge if it is indeed better to deny our problems today or if we should start responding to the warnings of environmentalists.

Royal & Sun Alliance hit by storm claims Lower forecasts likely after insurer issues warning that Christmas gales could cost up to L52m: [London edition]

Author: Kelly, Jim

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/royal-amp-sun-alliance-hit-storm-claims-lower/docview/248617408/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Royal & Sun Alliance , the UK's biggest household insurer, said yesterday that the storms on Christmas Eve, which left thousands of people without heat over the festive period, could cost it up to ¬£52m - significantly higher than initial estimates.

Full text: Royal & Sun Alliance , the UK's biggest household insurer, said yesterday that the storms on Christmas Eve, which left thousands of people without heat over the festive period, could cost it up to ¬£52m - significantly higher than initial estimates.
Analysts said the company was clearly signalling its unhappiness with the market's predictions and that as a result forecasts for 1997 profits should be nudged downwards from ¬£910m towards ¬£870m.
Royal & Sun Alliance said the forecasts may have overlooked claims in the north, Ireland, France and the Benelux countries, which were hit by the high winds that claimed six lives.
Steven Bird, insurance analyst at Merrill Lynch, believed Royal & Sun Alliance was "unhappy with the consensus figures".
He added that the market had been concentrating on the severe January storms rather than those at Christmas.
Royal & Sun Alliance said the claims had largely come from damaged homes and contents, factories and loss of goods kept in freezers. There was also associated flood damage.
However, the cost of the storms is less damaging than the ¬£233m the company faced after the hurricane of 1987 and the ¬£287m cost for the two storms of 1990. Claims for the January gales will relate to the insurer's 1998 figures.
By December 27, three days after the winds struck, electricity companies were still battling to complete emergency operations to restore supplies to about 14,000 homes. The worst of the weather hit northern England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
About 155,000 electricity customers in the UK lost supplies on Christmas Eve. Electricity companies said they had suffered a lot of damage to pylons and hundreds of extra workers were called in to restore supplies.
General Accident , the Perth-based insurer, has blamed global warming for an increase in the frequency and severity of gales and flooding. "Over the last 10 to 15 years, we've seen a tremendous amount of damage from storms. They are the most costly events in the UK," it said.
Statistical records compiled for the past 300 years show that strong gales are more common during mild winters.
But a recent report from Munich Re, the world's biggest reinsurer, said the number of storms worldwide had risen threefold since the 1960s. "That extreme atmospheric events accounted for such a large proportion of the losses is evidence of climate change," the report said.
Insurers paid out ¬£1bn in claims in 1987, when a hurricane struck southern England.
That storm was thought to be a one-in-200-year event - at least until another highly destructive gale struck in 1990. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved.

Toronto -- Re A Frosty Warming (editorial -- Feb. 2):
That The Globe and Mail disbelieves the climate change phenomenon is like saying Saddam Hussein is flirting with disaster. Old news.
Environmental groups such as Greenpeace aren't the only ones making the connection between greenhouse gases and the recent dramatic global increase in extreme weather events. Steve Goldstein of the Insurance Information Institute in the United States recently noted, "The insurance industry is very much aware of global warming, because of the top 10 disasters that have occurred in the history of the United States, nine of them have happened in the past six years."
That 1997 was the warmest on record is fact. That a new emerging hot zone is forming over northwestern Canada is fact. That a new emerging cold zone is forming over the Labrador Sea is also fact.
In our report, The Great Ice Storm 1998: Climate Damage and Solar Solutions, Greenpeace notes these scientifically reported phenomenons and quotes extensive current scientific literature from NASA and other peer-reviewed sources on potential greenhouse gas effects on ocean circulation and wind systems and the frequency and intensity of El Nino events -- all of which are major influences on winter storms.
The future will bring different and alternative approaches to energy needs, and the growing debate about our overdependence on vulnerable electric utilities provides the opportunity to explore those approaches. Among the suggestions in our report, we propose small solar-powered backup systems to keep the lights on and the replacement of polluting and inefficient open hearth fireplaces with efficient enclosed wood heaters -- hardly a call for wholesale conversion to wood energy, as The Globe mistakenly implies. In the longer term, investment in solar technology would take many people off the central grid.
Given that extreme weather events will be increasingly likely in a greenhouse future, we need a real and informed debate about our current energy systems.

Abstract: The 1999 budget plan that President Clinton sent to Congress yesterday would leave the United States $10 billion in the black -- the first federal surplus in 30 years. The proposal calls for spending $1.733 trillion and collecting $1.743 trillion.

Full text: Corrections: An item on the Federal Page yesterday about the President's budget for the Internal Revenue Service reported the wrong increase for the agency. The IRS would get a total of $8.3 billion in Fiscal 1999, an increase of 6.4 percent. (Published 02/04/98)
The 1999 budget plan that President Clinton sent to Congress yesterday would leave the United States $10 billion in the black -- the first federal surplus in 30 years. The proposal calls for spending $1.733 trillion and collecting $1.743 trillion. Because the budget contains many new spending initiatives and tax breaks while cutting the budget of only one department -- Agriculture -- a surplus is possible only if the government collects the $65 billion it anticipates receiving as part of a tobacco industry settlement. The discretionary funds discussed below are in outlays -- the amount of money the government spends in the fiscal year, which begins in October -- unless otherwise specified. How each agency would be affected:
AGRICULTURE DOWN 1.3% Food Stamps Restoring the eligibility of 730,000 legal immigrants for food stamps next year will contribute to a $1.6 billion boost in the government's biggest feeding program, now running at $22.9 billion annually.
President Clinton vowed to restore the benefit after it was eliminated in the 1996 welfare law. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman noted that even with legal immigrants back on the rolls, 4 million fewer persons will receive food stamp benefits than in 1993.
The $54.3 billion Agriculture Department budget also includes a $34 million increase for the Food Safety and Inspection Service. Though an increase of only 5 percent, a separate Clinton initiative would provide an additional $101 million government-wide for research, consumer education and other steps to reduce food contamination.
Despite booming farm prosperity, the overall agriculture budget declines only slightly from 1998, reflecting continuing large fixed payments to farmers mandated in the 1996 Farm Act. In addition, the administration proposes improved access to credit by disadvantaged farmers and full funding of the crop insurance program.
-- Dan Morgan
COMMERCE UP 12.2% 2000 Census The Commerce Department budget would rise about 12 percent under Clinton's budget, to $4.6 billion in fiscal 1999, mostly because of the expense of preparing for the 2000 census.
Spending on the census would increase by 69 percent in 1999, to $1.087 billion, reflecting an increase in staff of 11,000, for a total of 16,500.
The administration also wants to increase spending on the controversial Advanced Technology Program, which promotes research and development partnerships with private industry. The program has been repeatedly cut by the Republican Congress on the grounds that it is a form of "industrial policy" requiring Washington to pick winners and losers among promising technologies.
The White House wants to spend $240 million on ATP in 1999, increasing to nearly $400 million by 2003 as more new technologies are funded.
-- Paul Blustein
DEFENSE UP 0.5% Defense Spending Clinton's $270.6 billion defense budget proposal, adjusted for inflation, fits a pattern of flat spending that administration officials expect to hold for the next few years.
The administration is proposing to boost funds in two critical areas, however. The budget adds $1 billion to address spare-parts shortages and maintenance backlogs and to sustain training levels, amid reports that increased deployments at a time of troop cuts have eroded military readiness. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen yesterday promised "new management systems to track unit deployments and to focus corrective action whenever they exceed certain thresholds."
Further, the budget provides $48.7 billion to update aging weaponry, a rise of about $4 billion over current procurement levels.
Notably absent are funding requests for military operations in Bosnia or the Persian Gulf region, which Pentagon officials said would come later in the year.
-- Bradley Graham
EDUCATION UP 10.4% More Teachers The nation's schools would receive another large infusion of money in the fiscal 1999 education budget -- $33.9 billion in outlays, an increase of more than 10 percent.
The most striking proposal is to spend $1 billion to start a seven-year program to help schools hire 100,000 teachers and to reduce class size in most elementary grades to 18 students per teacher.
Much of the new spending targets poor, urban schools with severe academic problems. Clinton is proposing to add $392 million to Title I, a program that provides classroom aid to the neediest students. He also wants to spend $200 million on an initiative to designate some urban districts "Education Opportunity Zones" and award grants to help them improve. The budget calls for increases for after-school programs, independent "charter" public schools, a new tutoring program -- called America Reads -- and to upgrade classroom technology.
Access to college was the focus of last year's education budget, and Clinton wants more spending on that subject again this year. He is proposing increases for Pell Grants, which needy college students use for tuition, and for work-study programs.
-- Rene Sanchez
ENERGY UP 5.6% Stressing Science The Department of Energy is asking for $18 billion in budget authority in fiscal 1999, up approximately $1.5 billion, or 9 percent, from its 1998 budget authority. DOE outlays, or actual spending, would be increased in the president's budget to $17.2 billion, up 5.6 percent from an estimated $16.4 billion in 1998.
Energy Secretary Federico Pen~a said the budget emphasizes "science, technology and energy for our future." Major increases include more money for research and development in energy efficiency, renewable energy, fossil energy and nuclear energy. That includes spending on research to improve the operations of aging nuclear power plants.
About $330 million of President Clinton's proposed $6 billion in expenditures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases are included in the DOE budget.
The budget also includes a request for $421 million to support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and address the threat of nuclear proliferation and $317 million to continue the cleanup of highly radioactive and toxic waste at old nuclear weapons facilities. DOE is requesting budget authority of $160 million to support the operation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve without relying on oil sales from the reserve.
-- Martha M. Hamilton
EPA UP 10.9% Climate Change New assaults against water pollution, toxic waste and global warming add up to the biggest bottom line ever for the Environmental Protection Agency. Outlays would jump nearly 11 percent to $7.1 billion, according to the White House.
EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner is asking for $116 million in new spending for climate change initiatives, more than doubling the agency's current efforts. The increase is part of the $6.3 billion Clinton wants to spend over the next five years to reduce the country's emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.
Another $145 million in new spending will fund the clean-water initiative announced by Vice President Gore in the fall, Browner said. Most would go to states and local communities to help them reduce indirect pollution from farms, lawns and city streets.
-- Joby Warrick
HHS UP 6.0% Medicare Growth Health and Human Services Department outlays would rise from $359 billion in fiscal 1998 to $381 billion, a 6 percent increase. The administration has proposed expanding Medicare to some Americans age 55 and older, increasing costs nearly 5 percent to $205 billion.
The administration proposed a $1.15 billion increase, or 8.4 percent, for the National Institutes of Health, the single largest dollar increase in its history. Additional funds would create a Research Fund for America to bolster the nation's investment in basic medical research and focus more effort on disease prevention.
The president has proposed a major increase in resources for child care, including a $7.5 billion increase over five years to help cover the cost for low- and moderate-income families.
Medicaid, which covers health care for the poor, would grow from $101 billion to $108 billion.
-- Barbara Vobejda
HUD UP 1.9% Modest Proposals The 1999 budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development is peppered with modest initiatives in nearly every program area. Nearly $1 billion is earmarked for housing rental assistance and economic development, while big percentage increases were proposed in spending to help the homeless and to fight housing discrimination.
Most notably, the administration proposes the first increases in vouchers to help poor families pay for housing costs since the number was frozen at 3.1 million in 1994. Half of the 100,000 new vouchers would be reserved for families leaving welfare for work, 34,000 for the homeless and 8,800 for the elderly.
Overall, HUD spending in fiscal 1999 will go up less than 2 percent to $31.6 billion, but the department is seeking to launch $1.8 billion in new programs, some of which will be paid for over several years.
The budget also includes $400 million to help economically distressed communities retain and create jobs, and $50 million in additional Community Development Block Grants, the department's mainstay program for local governments.
-- Judith Havemann
INTERIOR NO CHANGE Park Repairs Some long overdue repairs are in store for America's 350 national parks if Congress fully funds Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's 1999 spending plan. Babbitt wants to expand the parks' maintenance budget by 18 percent, or $86 million, as part of a five-year effort to repair crumbling infrastructure.
The department's $8.1 billion budget proposal represents a 6 percent jump over the current budget. The actual 1999 outlays would total $7.9 billion, or about the same as the current year.
The budget calls for a 42 percent increase for endangered species programs, including 100 new "Habitat Conservation Plans" to protect threatened creatures and plants on private lands. It proposes $213 million in new land acquisitions, including ecologically important tracts in the Everglades, Southern California and the Mississippi Delta.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs would receive an additional $142 million to fund education programs and improve law enforcement.
-- Joby Warrick
JUSTICE UP 17.4% Intensifying Fight Citing a need to intensify the fight against youth violence, narcotics, illegal immigration and "cybercrime," Attorney General Janet Reno said the Justice Department is seeking a 4.4 percent increase in its budget for fiscal 1999.
That would bring the department's budget authority to $20.9 billion, up 87 percent since Clinton took office.
The new budget includes $481 million for various programs to curb violent juvenile crime and support additional prosecutors. A total of $1.4 billion would go toward putting 16,000 more "community oriented police officers" on the street.
The budget request also calls for 75 additional FBI agents and 24 government attorneys to "keep pace with the cybercriminals of the 21st century," Reno said.
The budget also includes $7.7 billion to fight drug trafficking, adding 257 new anti-narcotics agents. The department also wants $4.2 billion for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, up 10.3 percent from this year. The agency plans to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agents.
-- William Branigin
LABOR UP 12.2% Mostly Mandatory The overall Labor Department budget calls for $36 billion in outlays for fiscal 1999, a 12.1 percent increase over Clinton's budget request last year. But all the increase is in mandatory programs over which the department has no control. Discretionary spending for new programs actually is down $100 million from $10.6 billion in the previous year.
Two-thirds of Labor's budget involves mandatory spending for such programs as job training and unemployment insurance benefits.
Nonetheless, Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman said the department was asking for increased spending in areas such as summer hiring for out-of-school youth, adult training grants and veterans' employment.
-- Frank Swoboda
STATE NO CHANGE Africa Aid Boost Although the State Department spending remains flat, the president's budget seeks about $20 billion for international affairs, including foreign aid, operation of the State Department, military aid, and payment to the United Nations and other international agencies, as well as U.S. contributions to international development banks.
That figure represents an increase of about 6 percent from this year's appropriated level, and it is more than 10 percent above the level in fiscal 1997, when international affairs spending bottomed out.
Much of the new money would be spent on aid to Africa, including $35 million in debt relief and $30 million for a special program mostly focused on building judiciary systems in Rwanda and Burundi. Aid to Haiti would double, from $70 million to $140 million.
Not included is $1.02 billion the administration is seeking to pay this country's debt to the United Nations. That money will be sought in a separate supplemental appropriation.
-- Thomas W. Lippman
TRANSPORTATION UP 2.0% Details to Come Overall spending on the nation's transportation infrastructure would rise under the administration's fiscal 1999 budget to the highest level in the Department of Transportation's history. But details of the increases remain murky. Congress has yet to agree on a highway construction spending formula, and DOT officials were unable yesterday to offer specifics on how the administration would finance Clinton's proposed Transportation Fund for America.
Budget documents say the fund would be financed in part by new aviation user fees. Beginning in 2000, the administration assumes that the current aviation excise taxes will be "gradually reduced and replaced with a more efficient system of cost-based user fees" for Federal Aviation Administration services.
Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater said Amtrak, the federally financed rail passenger service, will get the highest level of taxpayer support it has known in years. The budget calls for $621 million in fiscal 1999 for Amtrak.
-- Bill McAllister
TREASURY UP 3.1% IRS Improvements Under attack in Congress for mistreating taxpayers and lagging in its computer modernization program, the Internal Revenue Service would get an increase of $534 million to improve customer service and update its computers. The IRS, part of the Treasury Department, would get an overall increase of $8.3 billion from fiscal 1998.
The budget adds 1,500 full-time staff positions to handle telephone calls from taxpayers and provide other services.
Outlays for the Treasury Department would be about $399 billion, up from about $387 billion in fiscal 1998.
-- Judy Sarasohn
VETERANS AFFAIRS UP 0.2% Slow Growth The Clinton administration made good on its promise to slow the rate of growth in the Department of Veterans Affairs, a ploy that, no doubt, will increase pressure on Congress to enact legislation allowing VA hospitals to tap Medicare funding. Without Medicare, VA officials say, the future of their 170 hospitals is in doubt.
Overall VA spending would increase slightly to $42.3 billion, while spending on medical programs would dip slightly. That decrease should be offset by insurance payments, which Congress has agreed to let the VA keep.
The administration will ask Congress once again to overturn smoking-benefit rulings by its own general counsel. Those rulings would grant millions in compensation to veterans who smoked on active duty and have become ill as a result.

First Balanced Federal Budget In 30 Years Offered by Clinton: [FINAL Edition]

Author: Pianin, Eric

Abstract: President Clinton yesterday did what he promised in his State of the Union address and submitted the first balanced budget in 30 years, one that would bar substantial new spending and tax cuts until a plan is in place to preserve Social Security. Republicans and some Democrats -- including Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. (S.C.), the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee -- warn that the settlement itself may be in serious trouble in Congress. Unless Clinton or his top lieutenants get more aggressively involved in trying to work out the tobacco legislation than they have in the past, "I don't see it happening," Lott said. "Right now the tobacco agreement is losing ground rather than gaining ground," Spratt said. Yet unlike many presidential budgets, Clinton's $1.7 trillion budget -- projecting a $9.5 billion surplus next year and packed with an estimated $130 billion to $150 billion of new spending and tax cuts over five years -- was not declared dead on arrival. All of that spending, Clinton insisted, will be paid for.

Full text: President Clinton yesterday did what he promised in his State of the Union address and submitted the first balanced budget in 30 years, one that would bar substantial new spending and tax cuts until a plan is in place to preserve Social Security.
"This budget marks an end to decades of deficits that have shackled our economy, paralyzed our politics and held our people back," Clinton said at a White House ceremony. "It can mark the beginning of a new era of opportunity for a new American Century."
The 368-page document the administration sent to Congress yesterday is the first formal move in what will be a series of political and legislative maneuvers throughout the coming months to craft a final budget and tax plan for fiscal 1999, which begins Oct. 1.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (Miss.) and other GOP leaders quickly challenged some of the president's spending priorities and how he intended to pay for them. "You're talking about the lollipop budget . . . with lollipops for everyone," Lott told reporters.
The biggest criticism of Clinton's proposal is his use of $65 billion of a proposed tobacco industry settlement to offset about two-thirds of the cost of new spending and tax relief initiatives for education, child care, expanded health care, research and other measures.
Republicans and some Democrats -- including Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. (S.C.), the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee -- warn that the settlement itself may be in serious trouble in Congress. Unless Clinton or his top lieutenants get more aggressively involved in trying to work out the tobacco legislation than they have in the past, "I don't see it happening," Lott said. "Right now the tobacco agreement is losing ground rather than gaining ground," Spratt said.
Yet unlike many presidential budgets, Clinton's $1.7 trillion budget -- projecting a $9.5 billion surplus next year and packed with an estimated $130 billion to $150 billion of new spending and tax cuts over five years -- was not declared dead on arrival. All of that spending, Clinton insisted, will be paid for.
With polls showing growing support for Clinton's spending priorities and his desire to use the surplus to bolster Social Security against the tide of baby boom retirements that threaten its long-term solvency, Republicans have little choice but to take seriously the president's proposals -- even as Clinton struggles with the White House sex scandal.
According to a new Washington Post poll, 75 percent of those interviewed approve of Clinton's call to strengthen Social Security before using any of the projected surpluses. While nearly half of the Americans surveyed described Social Security reform as their top priority, only 17 percent called for further reductions in income taxes -- as favored by many Republicans -- and 10 percent favored new domestic programs.
Republican criticism was further tempered by widespread voter approval of Clinton's handling of the economy and the fact that the president's new budget is tied into last summer's bipartisan balanced budget agreement that both parties heralded as a turning point in GOP-Democratic relations.
"It's obvious that the president of the United States is popular," Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) told reporters. "It's obvious that he has put forth a series, long litany, of popular programs . . . {but} it's absolutely preposterous, the contradiction of telling the American people government's getting smaller." He said Clinton's plan to use proceeds from a tobacco settlement that may not materialize was irresponsible and could lead to spending in excess of limits established by last year's budget agreement.
Overall, Clinton's budget projects a 3.9 percent increase in federal spending over the current fiscal year. The biggest winners are child care, with $21 billion for increased subsidies, tax credits and grants; and education, with large increases to add 100,000 teachers and reduce class size for grades 1 through 3 as well as build or remodel 5,000 schools. Clinton has also proposed greatly expanding the Medicare national health program for seniors by extending eligibility to Americans 55 to 64 years of age who can afford the premium.
Republican budget leaders promised to come up with a leaner budget plan of their own that emphasized tax cuts, not new spending.
"Looking at this budget, the era of big government is back," House Budget Committee Chairman John R. Kasich (R-Ohio) said of Clinton's proposal.
During a spirited budget celebration in the White House's ornate East Room with Vice President Gore, members of the Cabinet and three dozen congressional Democrats, the president declared that a legacy of surpluses totaling $1 trillion by 2008, strong economic growth and a financially solid national retirement system was within the country's grasp. By contrast, the previous two decades have been marked by historic peacetime deficits that peaked at $290 billion, the year Clinton first took office, and that largely colored the political debate in Washington.
"We have a great opportunity now to take action to avert a crisis in the Social Security system," Clinton said. "We don't need to take any shortcuts, we don't need to take any short-term benefits. Before we do anything with that surplus, let's save Social Security first."
Gore, who has been serving as the administration's chief cheerleader in recent days, hailed Clinton's 1993 anti-deficit and tax increase package passed without a single GOP vote as the turning point in the decades-old battle to break the deficit and urged Republicans and Democrats to resist the temptation to begin spending the surplus.
"Now, with momentum on our side and our economy thriving, this is no time to go back to Washington, D.C.'s bad old days," Gore said. "Already, some of the very same voices who were so wrong in opposing our '93 plan, and opposing our '97 agreement, have been urging us to start spending again like there's no tomorrow, or giving away the store in huge budget-busting tax breaks."
Spending in 1999 would total $1.733 trillion under Clinton's budget, compared with $1.66 trillion this year. Clinton's plan would raise $106 billion in new revenue over the next five years, including $65.5 billion from the tobacco settlement and $23 billion from tax increases on the insurance industry, Wall Street and investors. Billions more to pay for the spending would come from levies on polluters and others.
More than half the budget will go for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlement programs, which would receive a 6 percent increase over this year.
Spending for all other domestic programs and agencies would rise by about 5 percent, with the Environmental Protection Agency's budget jumping by nearly 11 percent and the National Institutes of Health receiving an 8.4 percent increase -- the single largest dollar increase in its history. The Energy Department and National Science Foundation are also slated for sizable increases, reflecting administration priorities in medical research, energy efficiency, climate studies and science education.
Treatment of AIDS patients would grow by $100 million and food safety efforts would increase by $101 million, or 12 percent.
Democrats praised Clinton for these and other spending initiatives, but House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) scoffed: "This is a budget only a liberal could love."
Defense and foreign aid spending, meanwhile, would remain virtually static, with $266.5 billion in outlays for the Pentagon and $18.6 billion earmarked for international affairs. The administration will seek $18 billion in lending authority for the International Monetary Fund, funding that fell victim last year to a congressional battle with the administration over international family planning and abortion language.
Clinton will also seek $1.02 billion to pay this country's debt to the United Nations, but those funds will be requested as part of a separate supplemental appropriation for the current year.
In a period of renewed abundance and surpluses, the Agriculture Department was the only Cabinet-level agency to take a hit. The department would suffer a relatively mild 1.3 percent spending cut under the president's proposal. However, the budget would restore the eligibility of 730,000 legal immigrants for food stamps next year, providing a $1.6 billion boost in the government's biggest feeding program.
The new budget plan would reduce taxes by $24.2 billion through 2003, mostly for low- and middle-income families' child-care costs, to promote energy efficiency and for tax credits to spur construction of new schools.
Clinton's plan would achieve balance three years ahead of the 2002 target date set in last summer's bipartisan balanced budget deal. Thanks to a booming economy and record profit-taking on Wall Street, government tax revenue has far exceeded previous estimates and helped produce the surprising surpluses that Clinton now wants to dedicate to preserving Social Security.
The president's plan would effectively wall off the projected surpluses -- which will be substantial beginning early next century -- until Congress and the administration work out a plan in 1999 to shore up Social Security. The president's budget document describes the future surpluses as "Reserve Pending Social Security Reform."
Unless steps are taken, by 2029 the Social Security system will be able to take care of only three-quarters of the estimated retirees. The problem will continue to get worse without intervention as the number of retirees continues to grow while the work force contributing through the payroll tax continues to shrink.

Full text: WE are living in the "fossil fuel age" with its easy lifestyle and convenience. But it will not always be like this. Which is why the Sustainable Energy Forum is holding a national conference at Massey University this week to discuss energy issues which will affect us in the future.
Few people in New Zealand are concerned about energy. It is cheap, the lights always come on at the flick of a switch, petrol is available 24 hours a day, we can easily fly to Australia just to watch a game of rugby, and more natural gas has recently been discovered.
However, at some stage in the forseeable future, electricity will become more expensive to meet the ever-growing demand, particularly in rural areas, the crude oil price will rise, being subject to the whims of the politically unstable OPEC oil producing countries, and our natural gas reserves will run out.
In addition, there will be great pressures to reduce the use of fossil fuels as changes to the world climate become more evident. In anticipation the powerful global insurance industry is beginning to express its concerns over the number of extreme weather events and several oil companies have already diversified by investing large amounts in renewable energy technologies.
New Zealand food exports are already being scrutinised by competitors for the amounts of fossil fuels consumed during their production and transport to markets across the world -- another potential excuse for a trade barrier. Again the rural sector will be one of the first affected.
The problem is that most people will be unwilling to change their easy lifestyles, which currently depend very much on consuming high levels of energy -- for example driving the car round to the dairy to get a newspaper, jet skiing in circles but going nowhere, using a clothes drier on a sunny day, having all the lights on when only in one room, and it goes on . . .
Hence, most policy makers, who only ever consider the immediate future in their decisions, have no vision for the longer-term which must include a sustainable energy future. The problem is that it will take many years to develop suitable economic alternatives to replace fossil fuels. So the planing has to start now. Nothing has ever been achieved for the environment without some form of regulations being put into lace, which are essential if long-term effects from using fossil fuels are to be accounted for.
In theory, New Zealand could be the first nation in the world to be fossil fuel free. We already have hydro and geothermal power supplying threequarters of our electricity. We also have excellent wind, good sunshine, a long coastline for tidal wave power, and a good climate and soils for growing energy crops and forests to provide heat, electricity and transport fuels.
But this would take decades to implement. Currently it would not make economic sense to suddenly change our dependency on oil, coal and gas. But as the rest of the world plans for alternatives, so should we. Europe for example has a target in place to double its energy supply using renewable sources from six percent now to 12 percent by 2010 which will also create jobs and protect the environment. (They can only hope to meet their greenhouse gas reduction obligations by encouraging Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency measures). The USA and Australia have similar goals. New Zealand has no such targets.
The Sustainable Energy Conference will include Environment Minister Simon Upton and MPs from all the other main political parties considering components needed for a greenhouse gas policy "Kyoto Action Plan" which follows on from the recent international climate change conference at Kyoto.
They will also be asked whether they would subscribe to a multi- party accord, given the fact that implementation will cover the lives of many governments (as well as the fact that the private sector would like some consistency in policy).
Other energy policy issues will be discussed on the second day of the conference, focusing on the rural sector in particular. The third day will be dedicated to the latest energy technologies. These include the revolutionary Capstone turbine of Fletcher Challenge Energy which can run on a gas or liquid fuel and generate enough electricity for a large house or a small village without noise or pollution.
By the end of the conference, delegates will have a better idea of what our energy future holds and where the business opportunities are.

Green scores hit the bottom line: The search is on for a way to link environmental performance with profitability. Leyla Boulton reports: [London edition]

Abstract: Greed-is-good caught the flavour of the 1980s; green-is-good is arguably the 1990s' equivalent. What big company would dare to deny publicly that paying attention to the environment is not only the right thing to do but also makes good business sense? Good green behaviour, the argument goes, may help a company's image and sales, pre-empt new environmental regulations, boost staff morale and save money. In the longer run it may even help lower a company's cost of capital by attracting better terms from investors and lenders. The evidence for this is largely anecdotal - attempts to make the link empirically have been fairly crude. For example, a recent study by the University of Michigan showed a rough correlation between Standard & Poor 500 companies' ability to cut polluting discharges and indicators such as return on assets and sales. Before the link between greenness and profitability can be established with any rigour, a measure of what constitutes good environmental performance first has to be made. The absence of standard measuring tools has meant that investors have been unable to compare companies' environmental performance as they can return on investment or profit margins.

Full text: Greed-is-good caught the flavour of the 1980s; green-is-good is arguably the 1990s' equivalent. What big company would dare to deny publicly that paying attention to the environment is not only the right thing to do but also makes good business sense?
Good green behaviour, the argument goes, may help a company's image and sales, pre-empt new environmental regulations, boost staff morale and save money. In the longer run it may even help lower a company's cost of capital by attracting better terms from investors and lenders. The evidence for this is largely anecdotal - attempts to make the link empirically have been fairly crude. For example, a recent study by the University of Michigan showed a rough correlation between Standard & Poor 500 companies' ability to cut polluting discharges and indicators such as return on assets and sales.
"While not supported by hard statistics, the idea that such companies will ultimately perform better seems to have a certain logic about it," says Jonathan Colchester, a portfolio manager for the private clients business of Credit Suisse .
Before the link between greenness and profitability can be established with any rigour, a measure of what constitutes good environmental performance first has to be made. The absence of standard measuring tools has meant that investors have been unable to compare companies' environmental performance as they can return on investment or profit margins.
Investors, consumers and even companies themselves are searching for better green tools with which to measure performance and exposure to environmental risk.
"Until common benchmarking measures are arrived at," says Anita Roddick, founder of the Body Shop , companies will be doomed to "comparing themselves to their own performance".
The latest attempt to come up with such a benchmark ranking Britain's 100 biggest quoted companies is today's published by Business in the Environment , the non-profit organisation.
They companies are ranked into one of five levels of achievement according to whether they have the building blocks - such as a main board member with responsibility for environment, or an environmental procurement policy - for managing their impact on the environment.
The method chosen for the survey has obvious flaws. The top quintile is dominated by companies which, by virtue of their sector, are significant polluters such as ICI ,the chemicals giant, and National Power, the electricity generator.
Meanwhile, half the companies in the bottom quintile are insurance companies or banks such as GeneralAccident and Royal Bank of Scotland which, perhaps not surprisingly because of the nature of their activities, may have given environmental matters little consideration.
Some FTSE-100 companies - including Pearson , owner of the Financial Times - have refused to take part because of these criticisms. "How can you put oil companies at the top and us near the bottom when our potential to pollute is so much less," asks Legal & General , one of Britain's biggest insurers, which withdrew after being ranked in the bottom category last year.
Business in the Environment, in response to such objections, plans next year to assess companies' performance within specific sectors. This could entail, for example, measuring companies' consumption of natural resources or, where relevant, their polluting discharges.
Other efforts to develop more precise tools, which could impact directly on a company's financial standing, are also being made. In November, London University 's Imperial College and National Provident Institution, a London insurer, produced an indicator enabling companies to measure emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas linked to climate change.
Published days before governments agreed legally binding curbs on emissions at Kyoto, the indicator aims to help investors assess companies' exposure to possible penalties for wasteful fossil fuel consumption.
Tessa Tennant, head of NPI's ethical investment arm, believes that, as governments move to tax or limit companies' energy consumption, such an indicator will some day make useful reading in company accounts.
An even more explicit attempt to link environmental risk with the bottom line was published last month. Serm Rating Agency , a UK consultancy, unveiled a system for rating companies according to how well they manage environmental risks inherent in their types of business - for example damage to corporate reputation and clean-up costs from potential toxic spillages.
Ultimately, the better performers should expect to attract lower interest rates from lenders to reflect their reduced exposure to environmental risk, argues Jonathan Barber, Serm's managing director.
So far only one company, Eastern Electricity , has agreed to be rated under this system. It achieved AA, or "good+", the fourth highest grade on a scale which imitates those operated by credit rating agencies.
Other companies are looking into the possibility of following suit. "As the City becomes more educated as to what an environmental rating can do they will push other companies to submit to the same sort of exercise," forecasts Bill Watson, managing director of Eastern's Electricity generating division.
Despite the imperfections of some of the tools currently available, some companies welcome being able to make a start in measuring their green credentials.
"You've got to walk before you can run and we're walking," says Derek Higgs, chairman of the portfolio management arm of Prudential , Britain's biggest life assurance company, which comes in the last quintile of Business in the Environment's ranking. "We will do better next year."
And once it has put its own house in order, the Pru plans to pay much closer attention to the environmental impact of the companies in which it invests.
"We are likely over coming years to take a closer interest in environmental performance because we believe there is a link with ultimate investment values," says Mr Higgs. "It's a developing and tentative link, but it is there." Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved.

Full text: Following is President Clinton's State of the Union Message, as transcribed by The New York Times:
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans:
Since the last time we met in this chamber, America has lost two patriots and fine public servants. Though they sat on opposite sides of the aisle, Representatives Walter Capps and Sonny Bono shared a deep love for this House and an unshakable commitment to improving the lives of all our people. In the past few weeks, they've both been eulogized. Tonight, I think we should begin by sending a message to their families and their friends that we celebrate their lives and give thanks for their service to our nation.
For 209 years, it has been the President's duty to report to you on the State of the Union. Because of the hard work and high purpose of the American people, these are good times for America. We have more than 14 million new jobs. The lowest unemployment in 24 years. The lowest core inflation in 30 years. Incomes are rising, and we have the highest homeownership in history. Crime has dropped for a record five years in a row, and the welfare rolls are the lowest in 27 years. Our leadership in the world is unrivaled. Ladies and gentlemen, the state of our union is strong.
But with barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to rest; it is a time to build, to build the America within reach.
An America where everybody has a chance to get ahead with hard work. Where every citizen can live in a safe community. Where families are strong, schools are good, and all our young people can go on to college. An America where scientists find cures for diseases from diabetes to Alzheimer's to AIDS. An America where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach every book ever written, every painting ever painted, every symphony ever composed. Where government provides opportunity, and citizens honor the responsibility to give something back to their communities. An America which leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity.
This is the America we have begun to build; this is the America we can leave to our children, if we join together to finish the work at hand. Let us strengthen our nation for the 21st century.
Rarely have Americans lived through so much change, in so many ways, in so short a time. Quietly but with gathering force, the ground has shifted beneath our feet, as we have moved into an information age, a global economy, a truly new world.
For five years now, we have met the challenge of these changes as Americans have at every turning point in our history, by renewing the very idea of America: widening the circle of opportunity, deepening the meaning of our freedom, forging a more perfect union.
We shaped a new kind of government for the Information Age. I thank the Vice President for his leadership and the Congress for its support in building a government that is leaner, more flexible, a catalyst for new ideas. And most of all, a government that gives the American people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives.
We have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government is the enemy and those who say government is the answer. My fellow Americans, we have found a third way. We have the smallest government in 35 years, but a more progressive one. We have a smaller government, but a stronger nation.
We are moving steadily toward a an even stronger America in the 21st century. An economy that offers opportunity. A society rooted in responsibility. And a nation that lives as a community.
An Economy Offering Opportunity
First, Americans in this chamber and across our nation have pursued a new strategy for prosperity: fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and spur growth. Investments in education and skills, in science and technology and transportation, to prepare our people for the new economy. New markets for American products and American workers.
When I took office, the deficit for 1998 was projected to be $357 billion, and heading higher. This year, our deficit is projected to be $10 billion, and heading lower.
For three decades, six presidents have come before you to warn of the damage deficits pose to our nation. Tonight, I come before you to announce that the federal deficit, once so incomprehensibly large that it had eleven zeroes, will be, simply zero.
I will submit to Congress for 1999 the first balanced budget in 30 years.
And if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget this year, four years ahead of schedule.
You can all be proud of that, because turning a sea of red ink into black is no miracle. It is the product of hard work by the American people and of two visionary actions in Congress -- the courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent and the truly historic, bipartisan, balanced budget agreement passed by this Congress. Here's the really good news. If we maintain our resolve, we will produce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see.
We must not go back to unwise spending, or untargeted tax cuts, that risk reopening the deficit. Last year, together we enacted targeted tax cuts, so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in 20 years.
My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and new tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families: for education, for child care, for the environment. But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet this test: approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit.
Now if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What should we do with this projected surplus?
I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first.
Tonight, I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus -- that's every penny of any surplus -- until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.
Let us say -- let us say to all Americans watching tonight, whether you're 70, 50, or whether you just started paying into the system, Social Security will be there when you need it. Let us make this commitment: Social Security first. Let's do that together.
I also want to say that all the American people who are watching us tonight should be invited to join in this discussion in facing these issues squarely, and forming a true consensus on how we should proceed. We'll start by conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the country, and I hope that lawmakers of both parties will participate. We'll hold a White House conference on Social Security in December. And one year from now, I will convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic, bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation, a Social Security system that is strong in the 21st century.
In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity.
Because these times are good, we can afford to take one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for their families. We should raise the minimum wage.
The information age is first and foremost an education age in which education must start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime.
Last year, from this podium, I said that education has to be our highest priority. I laid out a 10- point plan to move us forward, and urged all of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door.
Since then, this Congress, across party lines, and the American people have responded, in the most important year for education in a generation, expanding public school choice, opening the way to 3,000 new charter schools, working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway, committing to expand Head Start to a million children, launching America Reads, sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8-year-olds can read.
Last year I proposed, and you passed, 220,000 new Pell Grant scholarships for deserving students. Student loans, students loans already less expensive and easier to repay, now you get to deduct the interest. Families all over America now can put their savings into new, tax-free education I.R.A.'s. And this year, for the first two years of college, families will get a $1,500 tax cut, a Hope Scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition. And for junior and senior year, graduate school, and job training, there is a lifetime learning credit. You did that, and you should be very proud of it.
And because of these actions I have something to say to every family listening to us tonight. Your children can go on to college. If you know a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up. She can go on to college. If you know a young couple struggling with bills worried they won't be able to save for their children to college, tell them not to give up. Their children can go on to college. If you know somebody who's caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up. He can go on to college.
Because of the things that have been done, we can make college as universal in the 21st century as high school is today. And my friends, this will change the face and future of America.
We have opened wide the doors of the world's best system of higher education. Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the world's best as well, by raising standards, raising expectations, and raising accountability.
Thanks to the actions of this Congress last year, we will soon have, for the very first time, a voluntary national test based on national standards in fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math. Parents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the basics.
And every parent already knows the key, good teachers and small classes. Tonight I propose the first-ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grades. My balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 new teachers who've passed a state competency test. Now, with these teachers, we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first, second, and third grades to an average of 18 students a class all across America.
Now, if I've got the math right, more teachers teaching smaller classes requires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax cut to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools.
We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.
Last year, in Chicago, they made that decision not to hold our children back, but to lift them up. Chicago stopped social promotion and started mandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up. I propose an effort to help other communities follow Chicago's lead. Let's say to them, Stop promoting children who don't learn, and we will give you the tools to make sure they do.
I also ask this Congress to support our effort to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to disadvantaged children starting in the sixth grade, so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they too will be able to go on to college.
As we enter the 21st century, the global economy requires us to seek opportunity not just at home, but in all the markets of the world. We must shape this global economy, not shrink from it. In the last five years, we have led the way in opening new markets, with 240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the proud stamp, ''Made in the U.S.A.''
Today, record high exports account for fully one-third of our economic growth. I want to keep them going, because that's the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer, more stable world.
All of you know, whatever your views are, that I think this is a great opportunity for America. I know there is opposition to more comprehensive trade agreements. I have listened carefully and I believe that the opposition is rooted in two fears: first, that our trading partners will have lower environmental and labor standards which will give them an unfair advantage in our markets and do their own people no favors even if there's more business; and second, that, if we have trade, more of our workers will lose their jobs and have to start over.
I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around the world. It should, I have made it abundantly clear, that it should be a part of our trade agenda. But we cannot influence other countries' decisions if we send them a message that we're backing away from trade with them.
This year, I will send legislation to Congress, and ask other nations to join us, to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all, abusive child labor.
We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left behind by the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may have nothing to do with trade.
That's why we have more than doubled funding for training dislocated workers since 1993, and if my new budget is adopted, we will triple funding.
That's why we must do more, and more quickly, to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason. You know we help communities in a special way when their military base closes. We ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes.
Again, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training programs we had today into one single G.I. Bill for Workers, a simple skills grant so people can on their own move quickly to new jobs, to higher incomes and brighter futures.
Now we all know, in every way in life, change is not always easy, but we have to decide whether we're going to try to hold it back and hid from it or reap its benefits. And remember the big picture here. While we've been entering into hundreds of new trade agreements, we've been creating millions of new jobs.
So this year we will forge new partnerships with Latin America, Asia and Europe. And we should pass the new African Trade Act. It has bipartisan support.
I will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiating authority necessary to open more new markets, and create more new jobs, which every President has had for two decades. You know, whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive, the world's economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent.
Today, an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere. Recent months have brought serious financial problems to Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and beyond.
Now, why should Americans be concerned about this?
First, these countries are our customers. If they sink into recession, they won't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them. Second, they're also our competitors, so if their currencies lose their value and go down, then the price of their goods will drop, flooding our market and others with much cheaper goods, which makes it a lot tougher for our people to compete. And finally, they are our strategic partners. Their stability bolsters our security.
The American economy remains sound and strong, and I want to keep it that way. But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world's economies, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible is the right thing to do for America and the right thing to do for a safer world.
Our policy is clear. No nation can recover if it does not reform itself. But when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform, we should help them to do it. So I call on Congress to renew America's commitment to the International Monetary Fund.
And I think we should say to all the people we're trying to represent here that preparing for a far-off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder until the clouds are just overhead.
A Society Rooted in Responsibility
A strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility.
A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare. We can be proud that after decades of finger-pointing and failure, together we ended the old welfare system. And we're now replacing welfare checks with paychecks.
Last year, after a record four-year decline in welfare rolls, I challenged our nation to move two million more Americans off welfare by the year 2000. I am pleased to report that we have also met that goal two full years ahead of schedule.
This is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual courage, persistence and hope. For 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Indiana, was on and off welfare. Today she's a dispatcher with a van company. She's saved enough money to move her family into a good neighborhood and she's helping other welfare recipients go to work. Elaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare revolution. There are millions like her all across America and I'm happy she could join the First Lady tonight. Elaine, we're very proud of you. Please stand up.
We still have a lot more to do, all of us, to make welfare reform a success, providing child care, helping families move closer to available jobs, challenging more companies to join our welfare-to-work partnership, increasing child support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty to support their own children. I also want to thank Congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard, and I hope you will finish that job this year.
We have to make it possible for all hard-working families to meet their most important responsibilities.
Two years ago, we helped guarantee that Americans can keep their health insurance when they change jobs. Last year, we extended health care to up to five million children. This year, I challenge Congress to take the next historic steps.
One hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizens are in managed-care plans. Those plans save money and they can improve care. But medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants. I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a Consumer Bill of Rights that says this: You have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest. You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need. You have the right to emergency room care, wherever and whenever you need it. You have the right to keep your medical records confidential. Now, traditional care or managed care, every American deserves quality care.
Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance. Some are retired, some are laid off, some lose their coverage when their spouses retire. After a lifetime of work, they're left with nowhere to turn.
So I ask the Congress: Let these hard-working Americans buy into the Medicare system. It won't add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless.
Next, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health threat that they face, an epidemic of teen smoking, spread by multimillion-dollar marketing campaigns.
I challenge Congress. Let's pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that will improve public health, protect our tobacco farmers and change the way tobacco companies do business forever. Let's do what it takes to bring teen smoking down. Let's raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next ten years, with penalties on the tobacco industry if keeps marketing to our children. Now, tomorrow, like every day, 3,000 children will start smoking. And a thousand will die early as a result. Let this Congress be remembered as the Congress that saved their lives.In the new economy, most parents work, harder than ever. They face a constant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers and their even more important obligations to be good parents.
The Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I was privileged to sign into law a President in 1993. Since then, about 15 million people have taken advantage of it, and I've met a lot of them all across this country. I ask you to extend that law to cover 10 million more workers, and to give parents time off when they have to go see their children's teachers or take them to the doctor.

Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work. Last year, I co-hosted the very first White House conference on child care with one of our foremost experts, America's First Lady. From all corners of America, we heard the same message without regard to region or income or political affiliation: We've got to raise the quality of child care. We've got to make it safer. We've got to make it more affordable.
So here's my plan: Help families to pay for child care for a million more children. Scholarships and background checks for child care workers, and a new emphasis on early learning. Tax credits for businesses that provide child care for their employees. And a larger child care tax credit for working families. Now, if you pass my plan, what this means is that a family of four with an income of $35,000 and high child care costs will no longer pay a single penny of federal income tax.
You know, I think this is such a big issue with me because of my own personal experience. I have often wondered how my mother, when she was a young widow, would have been able to go away to school and get and education and come back and support me if my grandparents hadn't been able to take care of me. She and I were really very lucky. How many other families have never had that same opportunity? The truth is, we don't know the answer to that question. But we do know the answer should be. Not a single American family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love.
A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe schools and safe neighborhoods.
We pursued a strategy of more police, tougher punishments, smarter prevention. With crime-fighting partnerships with local law enforcement and citizen groups, where the rubber hits the road. I can report to you tonight that it's working. Violent crime is down, robbery is down, assault is down, burglary is down, for five years in a row, all across America.
Now we need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on our streets.
Again I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more prosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs and guns and drugs, and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life.
And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after-school programs. I think every American should know that most juvenile crime is committed between the hours of 3 in the afternoon and 8 at night. We can keep so many of our children out of trouble in the first place if we give them someplace to go other than the streets, and we ought to do it.
Drug use is on the decline. I thank General McCaffrey for his leadership, and I thank this Congress for passing the largest anti-drug budget in history. Now I ask you to join me in a groundbreaking effort to hire 1,000 new border patrol agents, and to deploy the most sophisticated available new technologies, to help close the door on drugs at our borders.
Police, prosecutors, and prevention programs, as good as they are, they can't work if our court system doesn't work. Today, there are large numbers of vacancies in our federal courts. Here is what the Chief Justice of the United States wrote, ''[Judicial] vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice.'' I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea, and vote on the highly qualified nominees before you, up or down.
We must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world.
On the eve of a new century, we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security. But make no mistake about it, today's possibilities are not tomorrow's guarantees.
America must stand against the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism. We must combat an unholy axis of new threats from terrorists, international criminals and drug traffickers. These 21st-century predators feed on technology and the free flow of information and ideas and people and they will be all the more lethal if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands.
To meet these challenges, we are helping to write international rules of the road for the 21st century, protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating those who do not.
Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO. For 50 years, NATO contained Communism and kept America and Europe secure. Now these three formerly Communist countries have said ''yes'' to democracy. I ask the Senate to say yes to them, our new allies.
By taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century.
Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and their mission in Bosnia. This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to Sarajevo with Senator and Mrs. Dole and a bipartisan Congressional delegation. We saw children playing in the streets, where two years ago they were hiding from snipers and shells. The shops were filled with food, the cafes were alive with conversation.
The progress is unmistakable, but not yet irreversible. To take firm root, Bosnia's fragile peace still needs the support of American and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June. I think Senator Dole actually said it best. He said, this is like being ahead in the fourth quarter of a football game. Now is not the time to walk off the field and forfeit the victory.
I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla. They're very proud of what they're doing in Bosnia, and we're all very proud of them.
One of those brave soldiers is sitting with the First Lady tonight, Army Sgt. Michael Tolbert. His father was a decorated Vietnam vet. After college in Colorado, he joined the Army. Last year, he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia. Thank you very much, Sergeant, for what you represent. Please stand up.
In Bosnia, and around the world, our men and women in uniform, always do their mission well. Our mission must be to keep them well-trained and ready, to improve their quality of life and to provide the 21st-century weapons they need to defeat any enemy.
I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction.
This year, four decades after it was first proposed by President Eisenhower, a comprehensive nuclear test ban is within reach. By ending nuclear testing, we can help to prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons and make it more difficult for non-nuclear states to build them. I am pleased to announce that four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- Generals John Shalikashvili, Colin Powell and David Jones and Admiral William Crowe -- have endorsed this treaty. And I ask the Senate to approve it, this year.
Together, we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them.
Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire Gulf War. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, you cannot defy the will of the world. And when I say to him, you have used weapons of mass destruction before. We are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.
Last year, the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to protect our soldiers and citizens from poison gas. Now, we must act to prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror. The Biological Weapons Convention has been in effect for 23 years now. The rules are good, but the enforcement is weak.We must strengthen it with a new international inspection system to detect and deter cheating.
In the months ahead, I will pursue our security strategy with old allies in Asia and Europe and new partners from Africa to India and Pakistan . . . from South America to China. And from Belfast, to Korea to the Middle East, America will continue to stand with those who stand for peace.
Finally, it's long past time to make good on our debt to the United Nations.
More and more, we are working with other nations to achieve common goals. If we want America to lead, we've got to set a good example. As we see so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can also share our burdens. In this new era, our freedom and independence are actually enriched, not weakened by our increasing interdependence with other nations. But we have to do our part.
A Nation That Lives by Community
Our Founders set America on a permanent course toward ''a more perfect union.'' To all of you I say it is a journey we can only make together, living as one community.
First , we have to continue to reform our government -- the instrument of our national community.
Everyone knows elections have become too expensive, fueling a fund-raising arms race. This year, by March the 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold. Let's be clear. A vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for soft money and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year.
But, at least equally important, we have to address the reason for the explosion in campaign costs, the high cost of media advertising. I will -- to the folks watching at home, those were the groans of pain in the audience -- I will formally request that the Federal Communications Commission act to provide free or reduced cost television time for candidates who observe spending limits voluntarily. The, the airwaves are a public trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy.
Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, we've reduced the Federal payroll by 300,000 workers. Cut 16,000 pages of regulation, eliminated hundreds of programs and improved the operations of virtually every Government agency. But we can do more.
Like every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the I.R.S. We need some changes there. New citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers. Last year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of Representatives passed sweeping I.R.S reforms. This bill must not now languish in the Senate. Tonight I ask the Senate, follow the House, pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business.
I hope to goodness before I finish I can think of something to say follow the Senate on, so I'll be out of trouble.
A nation that lives as a community must value all its communities.
For the past five years, we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to inner city and poor rural areas -- with community development banks, more commercial loans into poor neighborhoods, cleanup of polluted sites for development. Under the continued leadership of the VicePresident, we propose to triple the number of empowerment zones to give businesses incentives to invest in those areas. We should also give poor families more help to move into homes of their own. And we should use tax cuts to spur the construction of more low income housing.
Last year this Congress took strong action to help the District of Columbia. Let us renew our resolve to make our capital city a great city for all who live and visit here.
Our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas. They are still the gateways for new immigrants, from every continent, who come here to work for their own American dreams. Let's keep our cities going strong into the 21st century. They're a very important part of our future.
Our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe, the water they drink, the earth they will inherit.
Last year, we put in place the toughest-ever controls on smog and soot. We moved to protect Yellowstone, the Everglades, Lake Tahoe. We expanded every community's right to know about toxics that threaten their children.
Just yesterday, our food safety plan took effect, using new science to protect consumers from dangers like e-coli and salmonella.
Tonight, I ask you to join me in launching a new Clean Water Initiative, a far-reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes and our coastal waters for our children.
Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change, global warming the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action.
The vast majority of scientists have concluded unequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, at some point in the next century we'll disrupt our climate and put our children and grandchildren at risk. This past December, America led the world to reach a historic agreement committing our nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market forces, new technologies, energy efficiency.
We have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6 billion in tax cuts and research and development to encourage innovation, renewable energy, fuel efficient cars, energy efficient homes.
Every time we have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have told us it would hurt the economy. Well, today our economy is the strongest in a generation and our environment is the cleanest in a generation. We have always found a way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time. And when it comes to global warming we'll do it again.
Finally, community means living by the defining American value -- the ideal heard round the world -- that we're all created equal.
Throughout our history, we haven't always honored that ideal and we've never fully lived up to it. Often it's easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common. It may be easier, but it's wrong.
What we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America truly becomes one nation, what do we have to do? We're becoming more and more and more diverse. Do you believe we can become one nation?
The answer cannot be to dwell on our differences, but to build on our shared values. We all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility. We all want our children to grow up in a world where their talents are matched by their opportunities.
I've launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our common interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us from becoming One America.
Let us begin by recognizing what we still must overcome. Discrimination against any American is un-American. We must vigorously, we must vigorously enforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask your help to end the backlog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sixty thousand of our fellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should act now to end their wait.
We should also recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward building one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans, without regard to race. When we open the doors of college to all Americans, when we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs available to people from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all parents have the child care they need, we're helping to build one nation.
We, in this chamber and in this government, must do all we can to address the continuing American challenge to build one America. But we'll only move forward if all our fellow citizens, including every one of you at home watching tonight, is also committed to this cause.
We must work together, learn together, live together, serve together. On the forge of common enterprise Americans of all backgrounds can hammer out a common identity. We see it today in the United States military, in the Peace Corps, in AmeriCorps, wherever people of all races and backgrounds come together in a shared endeavor and get a fair chance. We do just fine.
With shared values, and meaningful opportunities and honest communications, and citizen service, we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect. We are many. We must be one.
Millennium: Gifts to the Future
In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium. How will we mark that passage? It just happens once every thousand years.
This year, Hillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote America's creativity and innovation, and to preserve our heritage and culture into the 21st century. Our culture lives in every community, and every community has places of historic value that tell our stories as Americans. We should protect them. I am proposing a public private partnership to advance our arts and humanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving America's treasures, great and small.
And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future.
Now think about this. The entire store of human knowledge now doubles every five years. In the 1980's, scientists identified the gene causing cystic fibrosis. It took nine years. Last year, scientists located the gene that causes Parkinson's Disease in only nine days. Within a decade, ''gene chips'' will offer a road map for prevention of illnesses throughout a lifetime. Soon, we'll be able to carry all the phone calls on Mother's Day on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair. A child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22d century.
Tonight, as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st Century Research Fund for path-breaking scientific inquiry, the largest funding increase in history for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the National Cancer Institute. We have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes. I ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that finally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases.
As important as all this scientific progress is, we must continue to see that science serves humanity, not the other way around. We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American. And we must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities, and ban the cloning of human beings.
We should enable all the world's people to explore the far reaches of cyberspace.
Think of this. The first time I made a State of the Union speech to you, only a handful of physicists used the World Wide Web. Literally, just a handful of people. Now, in schools and libraries, homes and businesses, millions and millions of Americans surf the net every day.
We must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet, but we also must make sure that we protect the exploding global commercial potential of the Internet. We can do the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids. For one thing, I ask Congress to step up support for building the next generation Internet. It's getting kind of clogged, you know. And the next generation Internet will operate at speeds up to a thousand times faster than today. Even as we explore this inner space in the new millennium we're going to open new frontiers in outer space.
Throughout all history, humankind has had only one place to call home, our planet Earth. Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16 countries will build a foothold in the heavens, the international space station. With its vast expanses, scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential. And this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat missions and one five-hour space flight that changed the world, will return to the heavens. Godspeed, John Glenn.
John, you will carry with you America's hopes and on your uniform, once again, you will carry America's flag marking the unbroken connection between the deeds of America's past and the daring of America's future.
Nearly 200 years ago, a tattered flag, its broad stripes and bright stars still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle moved Francis Scott Key to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope, the words that became our national anthem. Today that star-spangled banner, along with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, are on display just a short walk from here. They are America's treasures. And we must also save them for the ages. I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images and the words that are the old and continuing glory of America, an America that has continued to rise through every age, against every challenge; a people of great works and greater possibilities, who have always, always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation, to widen the circle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of our freedom, to form that more perfect union. Let that be our gift to the 21st Century.
God Bless You, and God Bless the United States.

Excerpts from President Clinton's State of the Union address :
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans, since the last time we met in this chamber, America has lost two patriots and fine public servants. Though they say on opposite sides of the aisle, Representatives Walter Capps and Sonny Bono shared a deep love for this House and unshakable commitment to improving the lives of all our people.
Because of the hard work and high purpose of the American people, these are good times for America. We have more than 14 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 24 years, the lowest core inflation in 30 years.
Incomes are rising and we have the highest home ownership in history. Crime has dropped for a record five years in a row, and the welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in 27 years.
Our leadership in the world is unrivaled. Ladies and gentlemen, the state of our union is strong.
But with barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to rest. It is a time to build --to build the America within reach. An America where everybody has a chance to get ahead with hard work, where every citizen can live in a safe community, where families are strong, schools are good and all our young people can go on to college.
An America where scientists find cures for diseases from diabetes to Alzheimer's to AIDS. An America where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach every book ever written, every painting ever painted, every symphony ever composed.
Where government provides opportunity and citizens honor the responsibility to give something back to their communities. An America which leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity. This is the America we have begun to build. This is the America we can leave to our children, if we join together to finish the work at hand.
We have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government is the enemy and those who say government is the answer. My fellow Americans, we have found a third way. We have the smallest government in 35 years, but a more progressive one. We have a smaller government, but a stronger nation.
When I took office, the deficit for 1998 was projected to be $357 billion and heading higher. This year, our deficit is projected to be $10 billion and heading lower.
For three decades, six presidents have come before you to warn of the damage deficits pose to our nation. Tonight I come before you to announce that the federal deficit, once so incomprehensibly large that it had 11 zeros, will be simply zero.
I will submit to Congress for 1999 the first balanced budget in 30 years.
Now if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple, four-word answer: Save Social Security first.
Tonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus, that's every penny of any surplus, until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.
Let us say --let us say to all Americans watching tonight --whether you're 70 or 50 or whether you just started paying into the system --Social Security will be there when you need it.
Let us make this commitment. Social Security first. Let's do that --together. In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity. Because these times are good, we can afford to take one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for their families.
We should raise the minimum wage.
I have something to say to every family listening to us tonight. Your children can go on to college. If you know a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up. She can go on to college. If you know a young couple struggling with bills, worried they won't be able to send their children to college, tell them not to give up --their children can go on to college.
If you know somebody who's caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up --he can go on to college.
My balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 new teachers who pass the state competency test. Now, with these teachers --listen, with these teachers, we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first, second and third grades to an average of 18 students a class all across America.
A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare.
We can be proud that after decades of finger pointing and failure, together we ended the old welfare system. And we're now replacing welfare checks with paychecks.
Last year after a record four-year decline in welfare rolls, I challenged our nation to move 2 million more Americans off welfare by the year 2000. I'm pleased to report we have also met that goal --two full years ahead of schedule.
This is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual courage, persistence and hope.
I also want to thank Congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard, and I hope you will finish that job this year.
We have to make it possible for all hard-working families to meet their most important responsibilities. Two years ago, we helped guarantee that Americans can keep their health insurance when they change jobs. Last year, we extended health care to up to 5 million children.
This year, I challenge Congress to take the next historic steps.
One hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans. These plans save money and they can improve care. But medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants.
I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a consumer bill of rights.
Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance. Some are retired. Some are laid off. Some lose their coverage when their spouses retire.
After a lifetime of work, they are left with nowhere to turn.
So I ask the Congress, let these hard-working Americans buy into the Medicare system. It won't add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless.
A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe schools and safe neighborhoods. We pursued a strategy of more police, tougher punishments, smarter prevention, with crime-fighting partnerships with local law enforcement and citizen groups where the rubber hits the road.
I can report to you tonight that it's working. Violent crime is down. Robbery is down. Assault is down. Burglary is down. For five years in a row, all across America.
Now, we need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on our streets. And again, I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more prosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs and guns and drugs and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life.
And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after-school programs.
Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
For 50 years, NATO contained communism and kept America and Europe secure. Now these three formerly communist countries have said yes to democracy. I ask the Senate to say yes to them, our new allies.
By taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century.
Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade and much of his nation's wealth not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and the missiles to deliver them.
The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire Gulf War. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein: You cannot defy the will of the world.
And when I say to him, you have used weapons of mass destruction before.
We are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.
We have to continue to reform our government, the instrument of our national community. Everyone knows elections have become too expensive, fueling a fund-raising arms race. This year, by March 6, at long last the Senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold.
Let's be clear --a vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for soft money and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year.
But --at least equally important, we have to address the real reason for the explosion in campaign costs --the high cost of media advertising. For the folks watching at home, those were the groans of pain in the audience. I will formally request that the Federal Communications Commission act to provide free or reduced cost television time for candidates to observe spending limits voluntarily.
The airwaves are a public trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy.
Like every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRS. We need some changes there.
New citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers.
Last year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of Representatives passed sweeping IRS reforms. This bill must not now languish in the Senate.
Tonight, I ask the Senate --Follow the House. Pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business.
Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action. The vast majority of scientists have concluded unequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses at some point in the next century, we'll disrupt our climate and put our children and grandchildren at risk.
We should also recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward building one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans --without regard to race.
When we open the doors of college to all Americans, when we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs available to people from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all parents have the child care they need, we're helping to build one nation.
Tonight as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st century research fund for pathbreaking scientific inquiry, the largest funding increase in history for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Cancer Institute.
We have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes. I ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that finally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases.

Full text: Following is President Clinton's State of the Union Address to the 105th Congress last night:
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans:
Since the last time we met in this chamber, America has lost two patriots and fine public servants. Though they sat on opposite sides of the aisle, Representatives Walter Capps and Sonny Bono shared a deep love for this House and an unshakable commitment to improving the lives of all our people.
In the past few weeks, they have both been eulogized. Tonight, I think we should begin by sending a message to their families and their friends that we celebrate their lives, and give thanks for their service to our nation.
For 209 years, it has been the president's duty to report to you on the state of the union. Because of the hard work and high purpose of the American people, these are good times for America. We have more than 14 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 24 years, the lowest core inflation in 30 years, incomes are rising and we have the highest home ownership in history. Crime has dropped for a record five years in a row, and the welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in 27 years. Our leadership in the world is unrivaled. Ladies and gentlemen, the state of our union is strong.
But with barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to rest. It is a time to build -- to build the America within reach, an America where everybody has a chance to get ahead, with hard work; where every citizen can live in a safe community; where families are strong, schools are good, and all our young people can go on to college; an America where scientists find cures for diseases from diabetes to Alzheimer's to AIDS; an America where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach every book ever written, every painting ever painted, every symphony ever composed; where government provides opportunity and citizens honor the responsibility to give something back to their communities; an America which leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity.
This is the America we have begun to build. This is the America we can leave to our children -- if we join together to finish the work at hand. Let us strengthen our nation for the 21st century.
`Government for the Information Age'
Rarely have Americans lived through so much change in so many ways in so short a time. Quietly, but with gathering force, the ground has shifted beneath our feet as we have moved into an information age, a global economy, a truly new world.
For five years now, we have met the challenge of these changes as Americans have at every turning point in our history, by renewing the very idea of America, widening the circle of opportunity, deepening the meaning of our freedom, forging a more perfect union. We shaped a new kind of government for the information age. I thank the vice president for his leadership, and the Congress for its support, in building a government that is leaner, more flexible, a catalyst for new ideas, and most of all, a government that gives the American people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives.
We have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government is the enemy and those who say government is the answer. My fellow Americans, we have found a third way. We have the smallest government in 35 years, but a more progressive one. We have a smaller government but a stronger nation.
We are moving steadily toward an even stronger America in the 21st century -- an economy that offers opportunity, a society rooted in responsibility, and a nation that lives as a community.
First, Americans in this chamber and across this nation have pursued a new strategy for prosperity: fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and spur growth; investments in education and skills, in science and technology and transportation, to prepare our people for the new economy; new markets for American products and American workers.
When I took office, the deficit for 1998 was projected to be $357 billion, and heading higher. This year, our deficit is projected to be $10 billion, and heading lower.
For three decades, six presidents have come before you to warn of the damage deficits pose to our nation. Tonight, I come before you to announce that the federal deficit, once so incomprehensibly large that it had 11 zeros, will be simply zero. Thank you.
I will submit to Congress, for 1999, the first balanced budget in 30 years. And if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget this year -- four years ahead of schedule. You can all be proud of that, because turning a sea of red ink into black is no miracle. It is the product of hard work by the American people, and of two visionary actions in Congress: The courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent and -- and the truly historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement passed by this Congress.
`Save Social Security First'
Here's the really good news: If we maintain our resolve, we will produce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see.
We must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk reopening the deficit.
Last year, together, we enacted targeted tax cuts so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in 20 years.
My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and new tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families: for education, for child care, for the environment. But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet this test: Approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit.
Now, if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What should we do with this projected surplus?
I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first.
Thank you.
Tonight, I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus -- that's every penny of any surplus -- until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.
Let us say -- let us say to all Americans watching tonight, whether you're 70 or 50, or whether you just started paying into the system, Social Security will be there when you need it. Let us make this commitment: Social Security first. Let's do that -- together.
I also want to say that all the American people who are watching us tonight should be invited to join in this discussion, in facing these issues squarely and forming a true consensus on how we should proceed.
We'll start by conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the country, and I hope that lawmakers of both parties will participate. We'll hold a White House conference on Social Security in December. And one year from now, I will convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation, a Social Security system that is strong in the 21st century. Thank you.
`Reap the Rewards of Prosperity'
In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity. Because these times are good, we can afford to take one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for their families. We should raise the minimum wage.
The information age is first and foremost an education age, in which education will start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime.
Last year, from this podium, I said that education has to be our highest priority. I laid out a 10-point plan to move us forward, and urged all of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door.
Since then, this Congress -- across party lines -- and the American people have responded, in the most important year for education in a generation -- expanding public school choice, opening the way to 3,000 charter schools, working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway, committing to expand Head Start to a million children, launching America Reads, sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8-year-olds can read.
Last year I proposed -- and you passed -- 220,000 new Pell Grant scholarships for deserving students. Student loans, already less expensive and easier to repay -- now you get to deduct the interest. Families all over America now can put their savings into new, tax-free education IRAs. And this year, for the first two years of college, families will get a $1,500 tax credit -- a Hope Scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition. And for junior and senior year, graduate school, and job training, there is a lifetime learning credit. You did that, and you should be very proud of it.
`Your Children Can Go on to College'
And because of these actions, I have something to say to every family listening to us tonight: Your children can go on to college. If you know a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up, she can go on to college. If you know a young couple struggling with bills, worried they won't be able to send their children to college, tell them not to give up, their children can go on to college. If you know somebody who's caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up, he can go on to college.
Because of the things that have been done, we can make college as universal in the 21st century as high school is today. And, my friends, that will change the face and future of America.
We have opened wide the doors of the world's best system of higher education. Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the world's best as well -- by raising standards, raising expectations and raising accountability.
Thanks to the actions of this Congress last year, we will soon have, for the very first time, a voluntary national test based on national standards in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math.
Parents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the basics. And every parent already knows the key: good teachers and small classes.
`National Effort to Reduce Class Size'
Tonight, I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grades. Thank you. My -- thank you, thank you -- my balanced budget will help to hire a hundred thousand new teachers who have passed the state competency tests. Now with these teachers -- listen -- with these teachers, we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first, second and third grades to an average of 18 students a class all across America.
Now, if I've got the math right, more teachers teaching smaller classes requires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax cut to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools.
We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.
Last year, in Chicago, they made that decision -- not to hold our children back, but to lift them up. Chicago stopped social promotion and started mandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up.
I propose to help other communities follow Chicago's lead. Let's say to them stop promoting children who don't learn, and we will give you the tools to make sure they do.
I also ask this Congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to disadvantaged children starting in the sixth grade so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they, too, will be able to go on to college.
`We Must Shape This Global Economy'
As we enter the 21st century, the global economy requires us to seek opportunity not just at home, but in all the markets of the world. We must shape this global economy, not shrink from it.
In the last five years, we have led the way in opening new markets, with 240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the proud stamp, "Made in the USA." Today, record high exports account for fully one-third of our economic growth. I want to keep them going, because that's the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer, more stable world.
Now, all of you know, whatever your views are, that I think this is a great opportunity for America. I know there is opposition to more comprehensive trade agreements. I have listened carefully, and I believe that the opposition is rooted in two fears: first, that our trading partners will have lower environmental and labor standards, which will give them an unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favors, even if there's more business; and second, that if we have more trade, more of our workers will lose their jobs and have to start over.
I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around the world. It should -- I have made it abundantly clear that it should be a part of our trade agenda, but we cannot influence other countries' decisions if we send them a message that we're backing away from trade with them.
This year I will send legislation to Congress, and ask other nations to join us, to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all -- abusive child labor.
We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left behind with the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may have nothing to do with trade. That's why we have more than doubled funding for training dislocated workers since 1993. And if my new budget is adopted, we will triple funding. That's why we must do more, and more quickly, to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason.
You know, we help communities in a special way when their military base closes. We ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes.
Again, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training programs we have today into one single GI Bill for Workers, a simple skills grant so people can, on their own, move quickly to new jobs, to higher incomes and brighter futures.
Now, we all know in every way in life change is not always easy, but we have to decide whether we're going to try to hold it back and hide from it, or reap its benefits. And remember the big picture here: While we've been entering into hundreds of new trade agreements, we've been creating millions of new jobs. So this year we will forge new partnerships with Latin America, Asia and Europe, and we should pass the new African Trade Act. It has bipartisan support.
I will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiating authority necessary to open more new markets, created more new jobs, which every president has had for two decades.
You know, whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive, the world's economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent. Today, an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere. Recent months have brought serious financial problems to Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and beyond.
Now why should Americans be concerned about this?
First, these countries are our customers. If they sink into recession, they won't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them. Second, they're also our competitors, so if their currencies lose their value and go down, then the price of their goods will drop, flooding our market and others with much cheaper goods, which makes it a lot tougher for our people to compete. And finally, they are our strategic partners. Their stability bolsters our security.
The American economy remains sound and strong, and I want to keep it that way. But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world's economies, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible is the right thing to do for America, and the right thing to do for a safer world.
Our policy is clear: No nation can recover if it does not reform itself, but when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform, we should help them do it. So I call on Congress to renew America's commitment to the International Monetary Fund. Thank you.
And I think we should say to all the people we're trying to represent here, that preparing for a far off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder 'til the clouds are just overhead.
`We Ended the Old Welfare System'
A strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility. A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare. We could be proud that after decades of finger-pointing and failure, together we ended the old welfare system. And we're now replacing welfare checks with paychecks.
Last year, after a record four-year decline in welfare rolls I challenged our nation to move 2 million more Americans off welfare by the year 2000. I'm pleased to report we have also met that goal two full years ahead of schedule.
This is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual courage, persistence and hope.
For 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Indiana was on and off welfare. Today she's a dispatcher with a van company. She's saved enough money to move her family into a good neighborhood. And she's helping other welfare recipients go to work. Elaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare revolution. There are millions like her all across America, and I am happy she could join the first lady tonight. Elaine, we're very proud of you. Please stand up.
We still have a lot more to do, all of us, to make welfare reform a success: providing child care, helping families move closer to available jobs, challenging more companies to join our Welfare to Work Partnership, increasing child-support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty to support their own children. I also want to thank Congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard. And I hope you will finish that job this year.
We have to make it possible for all hard-working families to meet their most important responsibilities. Two years ago, we helped guarantee that Americans can keep their health insurance when they changed jobs. Last year, we extended health care to up to 5 million children.
This year, I challenge Congress to take the next historic steps. A hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans. These plans save money, and they can improve care. But medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants.
I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a consumer bill of rights that says this: You have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest. You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need. You have the right to emergency room care wherever and whenever you need it. You have the right to keep your medical records confidential.
Now, traditional care or managed care, every American deserves quality care. Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance. Some are retired. Some are laid off. Some lose their coverage when their spouses retire. After a lifetime of work, they're left with nowhere to turn.
So I ask the Congress, let these hard-working Americans buy into the Medicare system. It won't add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless.
`Bring Teen Smoking Down'
Next, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health threat that they face: an epidemic of teen smoking spread by multimillion dollar marketing campaigns. I challenge Congress. Let's pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that will improve public health, protect our tobacco farmers, and change the way tobacco companies do business forever.
Let's do what it takes to bring teen smoking down. Let's raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next 10 years, with penalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to our children.
Now tomorrow, like every day, 3,000 children will start smoking, and a thousand will die early as a result. Let this Congress be remembered as the Congress that saved their lives.
In the new economy, most parents work harder than ever. They face a constant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers, and their even more important obligations to be good parents.
The Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I was privileged to sign into law as president in 1993. Since then, about 15 million people have taken advantage of it, and I've met a lot of them all across this country. I ask you to extend the law to cover 10 million more workers, and to give parents time off when they have to go see their children's teachers or take them to the doctor.
`Child Care Is the Next Frontier'
Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work. Last year, I co-hosted the very first White House conference on child care with one of our foremost experts, America's first lady. From all corners of America, we heard the same message -- without regard to region or income or political affiliation -- we've got to raise the quality of child care, we've got to make it safer, we've got to make it more affordable.
So here's my plan: Help families to pay for child care for a million more children; scholarships and background checks for child-care workers, and a new emphasis on early learning; tax credits for businesses that provide child care for their employees; and a larger child-care tax credit for working families.
Now, if you pass my plan, what this means is that a family of four with an income of $35,000 and high child-care costs will no longer pay a single penny of federal income tax.
You know, I think this is such a big issue with me because of my own personal experience. I have often wondered how my mother, when she was a young widow, would have been able to go away to school and get an education and come back and support me, if my grandparents hadn't been able to take care of me. She and I were really very lucky.
How many other families have never had that same opportunity? The truth is, we don't know the answer to that question, but we do know what the answer should be. Not a single American family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love.
A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe schools, and safe neighborhoods. We pursued a strategy of more police, tougher punishment, smarter prevention with crime-fighting partnerships, with local law enforcement and citizen groups, where the rubber hits the road.
I can report to you tonight that it's working. Violent crime is down, robbery is down, assault is down, burglary is down for five years in a row all across America. Now, we need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on our streets.
Again, I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more prosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs and guns and drugs and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life. And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after-school programs.
I think every American should know that most juvenile crime is committed between the hours of 3:00 in the afternoon and 8:00 at night. We can keep so many of our children out of trouble in the first place if we give them some place to go other than the streets, and we ought to do it.
Drug use is on the decline. I thank General McCaffrey for his leadership, and I thank this Congress for passing the largest anti-drug budget in history. Now I ask you to join me in a ground-breaking effort to hire a thousand new Border Patrol agents and to deploy the most sophisticated available new technologies to help close the door on drugs at our borders.
Police, prosecutors, and prevention programs, good as they are, they can't work if our court system doesn't work. Today, there are large numbers of vacancies in our federal courts. Here is what the chief justice of the United States wrote: "Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice."
I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea and vote on the highly qualified nominees before you, up or down. Thank you. Thank you.
`Build a New Era of Peace and Security'
We must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world. On the eve of a new century, we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security. But make no mistake about it: Today's possibilities are not tomorrow's guarantees. America must stand against the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism. We must combat an unholy access of new threats from terrorists, international criminals and drug traffickers.
These 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of information and ideas and people, and they will be all the more lethal if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands. To meet these challenges, we are helping to write international rules of the road for the 21st century, protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating those who do not.
Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO.
For 50 years, NATO contained communism and kept America and Europe secure. Now these three formerly communist countries have said yes to democracy. I ask the Senate to say yes to them, our new allies.
By taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century.
Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and their mission in Bosnia. This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to Sarajevo with Senator and Mrs. Dole and a bipartisan congressional delegation. We saw children playing in the streets where, two years ago, they were hiding from snipers and shells. The shops were filled with food. The cafes were alive with conversation. The progress there is unmistakable; but it is not yet irreversible.
To take firm root, Bosnia's fragile peace still needs the support of American and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June. I think Senator Dole actually said it best. He said: "This is like being ahead in the fourth quarter of a football game; now is not the time to walk off the field and forfeit the victory."
I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla. They're very proud of what they are doing in Bosnia, and we're all very proud of them. One of those -- one of those brave soldiers is sitting with the first lady tonight: Army Sergeant Michael Tolbert. His father was a decorated Vietnam vet. After college in Colorado, he joined the Army. Last year he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia. Thank you very much, Sergeant, for what you represent.
In Bosnia and around the world, our men and women in uniform always do their mission well. Our mission must be to keep them well-trained and ready, to improve their quality of life, and to provide the 21st century weapons they need to defeat any enemy.
I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction. This year, four decades after it was first proposed by President Eisenhower, a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban is within reach. By ending nuclear testing, we can help to prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons, and make it more difficult for non-nuclear states to build them.
I am pleased to announce that four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- Generals John Shalikashvili, Colin Powell and David Jones, and Admiral William Crowe -- have endorsed this treaty, and I ask the Senate to approve it this year. Thank you.
Saddam `Cannot Defy the Will of the World'
Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons, and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them.
Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them.
The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire Gulf War. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission.
I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, "You cannot defy the will of the world," and when I say to him, "You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again."
Last year, the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to protect our soldiers and citizens from poison gas. Now we must act to prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror. The Biological Weapons Convention has been in effect for 23 years now. The rules are good, but the enforcement is weak. We must strengthen it with a new international inspection system to detect and deter cheating.
In the months ahead, I will pursue our security strategy with old allies in Asia and Europe, and new partners from Africa to India and Pakistan, from South America to China. And from Belfast to Korea to the Middle East, America will continue to stand with those who stand for peace.
Finally, it's long past time to make good on our debt to the United Nations. Thank you.
More and more we are working with other nations to achieve common goals. If we want America to lead, we've got to set a good example. As we see -- as we see so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can also share our burdens. In this new era, our freedom and independence are actually enriched, not weakened, by our increasing interdependence with other nations. But we have to do our part.
`Toward a More Perfect Union'
Our founders set America on a permanent course toward a more perfect union. To all of you, I say, it is a journey we can only make together, living as one community.
First, we have to continue to reform our government, the instrument of our national community. Everyone knows elections have become too expensive, fueling a fund-raising arms race.
This year, by March the 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold. Let's be clear; a vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for soft money and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year.
But at least equally important, we have to address the real reason for the explosion in campaign costs: the high cost of media advertising.
I will -- for the folks watching at home, those were the groans of pain in the audience -- I will formally request that the Federal Communications Commission act to provide free or reduced-cost television time -- for candidates who observe spending limits voluntarily. The airwaves are a public trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy.
Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, we have reduced the federal payroll by 300,000 workers, cut 16,000 pages of regulation, eliminated hundreds of programs and improved the operations of virtually every government agency. But we can do more.
Like every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRS. We need some changes there: new citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers.
Last year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of Representatives passed sweeping IRS reforms. This bill must not now languish in the Senate. Tonight, I ask the Senate: Follow the House; pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business.
I hope to goodness before I finish I can think of something to say `Follow the Senate' on so I'll be out of trouble!
`Make Our Capital City a Great City'
A nation that lives as a community must value all its communities. For the past five years, we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to inner city and poor rural areas with community development banks, more commercial loans into poor neighborhoods, cleanup of polluted sites for development.
Under the continued leadership of the vice president, we propose to triple the number of empowerment zones to give business incentives to invest in those areas. We should -- thank you. We should also give poor families more help to move into homes of their own, and we should use tax cuts to spur the construction of more low-income housing.
Last year, this Congress took strong action to help the District of Columbia. Let us renew our resolve to make our capital city a great city for all who live and visit here.
Our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas. They are still the gateway for new immigrants from every continent who come here to work for their own American dreams. Let's keep our cities going strong into the 21st century. They're a very important part of our future.
Our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe, the water they drink, the Earth they will inherit. Last year we put in place the toughest-ever controls on smog and soot. We moved to protect Yellowstone, the Everglades, Lake Tahoe. We expanded every community's right to know about toxics that threaten their children.
Just yesterday, our food safety plan took effect, using new science to protect consumers from dangers like e. coli and salmonella.
Tonight, I ask you to join me in launching a new Clean Water initiative, a far-reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes and our coastal waters for our children.
Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action. The vast majority of scientists have concluded unequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gases at some point in the next century, we'll disrupt our climate and put our children and grandchildren at risk.
This past December, America led the world to reach a historic agreement committing our nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market forces, new technologies, energy efficiency.
We have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6 billion in tax cuts, in research and development, to encourage innovation, renewable energy, fuel-efficient cars, energy-efficient homes. Every time we have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have told us it would hurt the economy. Well, today our economy is the strongest in a generation, and our environment is the cleanest in a generation. We have always found a way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time. And when it comes to global warming, we'll do it again. Thank you.
`We Are Many. We Must Be One'
Finally, community means living by the defining American value, the ideal heard 'round the world: that we're all created equal.
Throughout our history, we haven't always honored that ideal, and we've never fully lived up to it. Often it's easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common. It may be easier, but it's wrong.
What we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America truly becomes one nation, what do we have to do? We're becoming more and more and more diverse. Do you believe we can become one nation? The answer cannot be to dwell on our differences, but to build on our shared values.
And we all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility. We all want our children to grow up in the world where their talents are matched by their opportunities.
I've launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our common interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us from becoming one America. Let us begin by recognizing what we still must overcome.
Discrimination against any American is un-American. We must vigorously enforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask your help to end the backlog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sixty thousand of our fellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should act now to end their wait. Thank you.
We should also recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward building one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans, without regard to race. When we open the doors of college to all Americans, when we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs available to people from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all parents have the child care they need, we're helping to build one nation.
We in this chamber and in this government must do all we can to address the continuing American challenge to build one America. But we'll only move forward if all our fellow citizens, including every one of you at home watching tonight, is also committed to this cause.
We must work together, learn together, live together, serve together. On the forge of common enterprise, Americans of all backgrounds can hammer out a common identity.
We see it today in the United States military, in the Peace Corps, in AmeriCorps. Wherever people of all races and backgrounds come together in a shared endeavor and get a fair chance, we do just fine. With shared values and meaningful opportunities and honest communications and citizen service, we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect. We are many. We must be one.
`The New Millennium'
In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium. How will we mark that passage? It just happens once every thousand years. This year, Hillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote America's creativity and innovation and to preserve our heritage and culture into the 21st century. Our culture lives in every community, and every community has places of historic value that tell our stories as Americans. We should protect them.
I am proposing a public-private partnership to advance our arts and humanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving America's treasures, great and small. And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future.
Now, think about this. The entire store of human knowledge now doubles every five years. In the 1980s, scientists identified the gene causing cystic fibrosis; it took nine years. Last year, scientists located the gene that causes Parkinson's disease -- in only nine days! Within a decade, gene chips will offer a road map for prevention of illnesses throughout a lifetime. Soon, we'll be able to carry all the phone calls on Mother's Day on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair. A child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22nd century.
Tonight, as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st century research fund for pathbreaking scientific inquiry, the largest funding increase in history for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the National Cancer Institute. We have already discovered -- thank you -- we have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes. I ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that finally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases.
As important as all this scientific progress is, we must continue to see that science serves humanity, not the other way around. We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American, and we must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities, and ban the cloning of human beings.
We should enable all the world's people to explore the far reaches of cyberspace. Think of this: the first time I made a State of the Union speech to you, only a handful of physicists used the World Wide Web -- literally just a handful of people.
Now in schools and libraries, homes and businesses, millions and millions of Americans surf the Net every day.
We must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children from inappropriate material on the Net, but we also must make sure that we protect the exploding, global commercial potential of the Internet.
We can do the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids. For one thing, I ask Congress to step up support for building the next generation Internet. It's getting kind of clogged, you know. And the next generation Internet will operate at speeds up to a thousand times faster than today.
Even as we explore this inner space, in the new millennium we're going to open new frontiers in outer space.
Throughout all history, human kind has had only one place to call home: our planet Earth. Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16 countries will build a foothold in the heavens -- the International Space Station. With its vast expanses, scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential.
And this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat missions and one five-hour space flight that changed the world, will return to the heavens. Godspeed, John Glenn!
John, you will carry with you America's hopes, and on your uniform once again you will carry America's flag, marking the unbroken connection between the deeds of America's past and the daring of America's future.
Nearly 200 years ago, a tattered flag, its broad stripes and bright stars still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle, moved Francis Scott Key to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope, the words that became our National Anthem. Today, that Star-Spangled Banner, along with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, are on display just a short walk from here. They are America's treasures. And we must also save them for the ages.
I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images and the words that are the old and continuing glory of America, an America that has continued to rise through every age against every challenge, a people of great works and greater possibilities, who have always, always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation, to widen the circle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of our freedom, to form that more perfect union.
Let that be our gift to the 21st century.
God bless you, and God bless the United States.

Abstract: We'll hold the White House conference on Social Security in December. And one year from now, I will convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic, bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation: A Social Security system that is strong in the 21st century. America must stand against the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism. We must combat an unholy axis of new threats from terrorists, international criminals and drug traffickers. These 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of information and ideas and people, and they will be all the more lethal if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands. They're very proud of what they're doing in Bosnia and we're all very proud of them. One of those brave soldiers is sitting with the first lady tonight, Army Sergeant Michael Tolbert. His father was a decorated Vietnam vet. After college in Colorado, he joined the Army. Last year he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia.

Full text: Text of President Clinton's State of the Union address as delivered:
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress, distinguished guests and my fellow Americans, since the last time we met in this chamber, America has lost two patriots and fine public servants. Though they served on opposite sides of the aisle, representatives Walter Capps and Sonny Bono shared a deep love for this House and unshakable commitment to improving the lives of all our people.
In the past few weeks, they've both been eulogized. Tonight, I think we should begin by sending a message to their families and their friends that we celebrate their lives and give thanks for their service to our nation.
For 209 years, it has been the president's duty to report to you on the state of the union.
Because of the hard work and high purpose of the American people, these are good times for America. We have more than 14 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 24 years, the lowest core inflation in 30 years.
Incomes are rising and we have the highest home ownership in history. Crime has dropped for a record five years in a row, and the welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in 27 years.
Our leadership in the world is unrivaled. Ladies and gentlemen, the state of our union is strong.
But with barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to rest. It is a time to build -to build the America within reach. An America where everybody has a chance to get ahead with hard work, where every citizen can live in a safe community, where families are strong, schools are good and all our young people can go on to college.
An America where scientists find cures for diseases from diabetes to Alzheimer's to AIDS. An America where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach every book ever written, every painting ever painted, every symphony ever composed.
Where government provides opportunity and citizens honor the responsibility to give something back to their communities. An America which leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity. This is the America we have begun to build. This is the America we can leave to our children, if we join together to finish the work at hand.
Let us strengthen our nation for the 21st century.
Rarely have Americans lived through so much change in so many ways in so short a time. Quietly, but with gathering force, the ground has shifted beneath our feet, as we have moved into an information age, a global economy, a truly new world.
For five years now we have met the challenge of these changes as Americans have at every turning point in our history, by renewing the very idea of America. Widening the circle of opportunity. Deepening the meaning of our freedom. Forging a more perfect union.
We shaped a new kind of government for the Information Age.
I thank the vice president for his leadership and the Congress for its support in building a government that is leaner, more flexible, a catalyst for new ideas and, most of all, a government that gives the American people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives.
We have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government is the enemy and those who say government is the answer. My fellow Americans, we have found a third way. We have the smallest government in 35 years, but a more progressive one. We have a smaller government, but a stronger nation.
We are moving steadily toward an even stronger America in the 21st century, an economy that offers opportunity, a society rooted in responsibility, and a nation that lives as a community.
First, Americans in this chamber and across our nation have pursued a new strategy for prosperity: Fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and spur growth. Investments in education and skills and science and technology and transportation to prepare our people for the new economy. New markets for American products and American workers.
When I took office, the deficit for 1998 was projected to be $357 billion and heading higher. This year, our deficit is projected to be $10 billion and heading lower.
Thank you. Thank you.
For three decades, six presidents have come before you to warn of the damage deficits pose to our nation. Tonight I come before you to announce that the federal deficit, once so incomprehensibly large that it had 11 zeros, will be simply zero.
Thank you.
I will submit to Congress for 1999 the first balanced budget in 30 years.
Thank you.
And, if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget this year, four years ahead of schedule.
You can all be proud of that because turning a sea of red ink into black is no miracle. It is the product of hard work by the American people and of two visionary actions in Congress - the courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent.
And the truly historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement passed by this Congress.
Here's the really good news. If we maintain our resolve, we will produce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see.
We must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk reopening the deficit.
Last year, together we enacted targeted tax cuts so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in 20 years.
My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and new tax cuts, targeted to the needs of working families.
For education. For child care. For the environment. But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet this test. Approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit.
Now if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple, four-word answer: Save Social Security first.
Tonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus, that's every penny of any surplus, until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.
Let us say - let us say to all Americans watching tonight - whether you're 70 or 50 or whether you just started paying into the system - Social Security will be there when you need it.
Let us make this commitment. Social Security first. Let's do that - together.
I also want to say that all the American people who are watching us tonight should be invited to join in this discussion.
In facing these issues squarely. In forming a true consensus on how we should proceed. We'll start by conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the country. And I hope that lawmakers of both parties will participate.
We'll hold the White House conference on Social Security in December. And one year from now, I will convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic, bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation: A Social Security system that is strong in the 21st century.
In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity. Because these times are good, we can afford to take one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for their families.
We should raise the minimum wage.
The information age is first and foremost an information age in which education will start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime. Last year, from this podium, I said that education has to be our highest priority. I laid out a 10-point plan to move us forward and urged all of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door.
Since then, this Congress, across party lines, and the American people, have responded, in the most important year for education in a generation. Expanding public school choice. Opening the way to 3,000 new charter schools. Working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway. Committing to expand Head Start to a million children. Launching America Reads. Sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8-year-olds can read.
Last year, I proposed and you passed 220,000 new Pell grant scholarships for deserving students.
Student loans, already less expensive and easier to repay, now you get to deduct the interest.
Families all over America now can put their savings into new tax-free education IRAs. And this year, for the first two years of college, families will get a $1,500 tax credit - a Hope Scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition.
And for junior and senior year, graduate school and job training, there is a lifetime learning credit. You did that and you should be very proud of it.
And because of these actions, I have something to say to every family listening to us tonight. Your children can go on to college. If you know a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up. She can go on to college. If you know a young couple struggling with bills, worried they won't be able to send their children to college, tell them not to give up - their children can go on to college.
If you know somebody who's caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up - he can go on to college.
Because of the things that have been done, we can make college as universal in the 21st century as high school is today.
And my friends, that will change the face and future of America.
We have opened wide the doors of the world's best system of higher education. Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the world's best as well.
By raising standards, raising expectations and raising accountability. Thanks to the actions of this Congress last year, we will soon have for the very first time a voluntary national test based on national standards in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math. Parents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the basics. And every parent already knows the key - good teachers and small classes.
Tonight, I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grades. My balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 new teachers who pass the state competency test. Now, with these teachers - listen, with these teachers, we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first, second and third grades to an average of 18 students a class all across America.
Now, if I got the math right, more teachers, teaching smaller classes requires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax cut to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools.
We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors.
It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.
Last year - last year in Chicago, they made that decision not to hold our children back, but to lift them up. Chicago stopped social promotion, and started mandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up.
I propose to help other communities follow Chicago's lead. Let's say to them: Stop promoting children who don't learn and we will give you the tools to make sure they do.
I also asked this Congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to disadvantaged children, starting in the sixth grade, so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they, too, will be able to go on to college.
As we enter the 21st century, the global economy requires us to seek opportunity not just at home but in all the markets of the world. We must shape this global economy, not shrink from it.
In the last five years we have led the way in opening new markets with 240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the proud stamp, Made in the USA.
Today, record-high exports account for fully one-third of our economic growth. I want to keep them going because that's the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer, more stable world.
Now, all of you know, whatever your views are, that I think this is a great opportunity for America. I know there is opposition to more comprehensive trade agreements.
I have listened carefully, and I believe that the opposition is rooted in two fears. First, that our trading partners will have lower environmental and labor standards, which will give them an unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favors, even if there's more business.
And second, that if we have more trade, more of our workers will lose their jobs and have to start over. I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around the world.
I have made it abundantly clear that it should be a part of our trade agenda, but we cannot influence other countries' decisions if we send them a message that we're backing away from trade with them.
This year, I will send legislation to Congress and ask other nations to join us to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all - abusive child labor.
We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left behind by the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may have nothing to do with trade.
That's why we have more than doubled funding for training dislocated workers since 1993, and if my new budget is adopted, we will triple funding.
That's why we must do more and more quickly to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason.
You know, we help communities in a special way when their military base closes. We ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes.
Again, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training programs we have today into one single GI Bill for workers - a simple skills grant so people can on their own move quickly to new jobs, to higher incomes and brighter futures.
Now, we all know in every way in life, change is not always easy. But we have to decide whether we're going to try to hold it back and hide from it or reap its benefits.
And remember the big picture here. While we've been entering into hundreds of new trade agreements, we've been creating millions of new jobs.
So this year, we will forge new partnerships with Latin America, Asia and Europe. And we should pass the new African Trade Act. It has bipartisan support.
I will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiating authority necessary to open more new markets, create more new jobs, which every president has had for two decades.
You know, whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive, the world's economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent. Today an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere.
Recent months have brought serious financial problems to Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and beyond.
Now why should Americans be concerned about this?
First, these countries are our customers. If they sink in a recession, they won't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them. Second, they're also our competitors. So if their currencies lose their value and go down, then the price of their goods will drop, flooding our market and others with much cheaper goods which makes it a lot tougher four our people to compete.
And finally, they are our strategic partners. Their stability bolsters our security.
The American economy remains sound and strong and I want to keep it that way. But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world's economies, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible is the right thing to do for America and the right thing to do for a safer world.
Our policy is clear. No nation can recover if it does not reform itself.
But when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform, we should help them do it. So I call on Congress to renew America's commitment to the International Monetary Fund.
And I think we should say to all the people we're trying to represent here that preparing for a far-off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder until the clouds are just overhead.
A strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility.
A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare. We can be proud that after decades of finger pointing and failure, together we ended the old welfare system. And we're now replacing welfare checks with paychecks.
Last year after a record four-year decline in welfare rolls, I challenged our nation to move two million more Americans off welfare by the year 2000. I'm pleased to report we have also met that goal -two full years ahead of schedule.
This is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual courage, persistence and hope.
For 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Ind., was on and off welfare.
Today, she's a dispatcher with a van company. She's saved enough money to move her family into a good neighborhood, and she's helping other welfare recipients go to work. Elaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare revolution. There are millions like her all across America and I'm happy she could join the first lady tonight. Elaine, we're very proud of you. Please stand up.
We still have a lot more to do - all of us - to make welfare reform a success. Providing child care, helping families move closer to available jobs, challenging more companies to join our welfare-to-work partnership, increasing child support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty to support their own children.
I also want to thank Congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard, and I hope you will finish that job this year.
We have to make it possible for all hard-working families to meet their most important responsibilities. Two years ago, we helped guarantee that Americans can keep their health insurance when they change jobs. Last year, we extended health care to up to five million children.
This year, I challenge Congress to take the next historic steps.
A hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans. These plans save money and they can improve care. But medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants.
I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a consumer bill of rights that says this:
You have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest.
You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need.
You have the right to emergency room care wherever and whenever you need it.
You have the right to keep your medical records confidential.
Now, traditional care or managed care, every American deserves quality care.
Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance. Some are retired. Some are laid off. Some lose their coverage when their spouses retire.
After a lifetime of work, they are left with nowhere to turn.
So I ask the Congress, let these hard-working Americans buy into the Medicare system. It won't add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless.
Next, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health threat that they face - an epidemic of teen smoking, spread by multimillion dollar marketing campaigns.
I challenge Congress - let's pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that will improve public health, protect our tobacco farmers and change the way tobacco companies do business forever. Let's do what it takes to bring teen smoking down.
Let's raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next 10 years with penalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to our children.
Tomorrow, like every day, 3,000 children will start smoking, and 1,000 will die early as a result. Let this Congress be remembered as the Congress that saved their lives.
In the new economy, most parents work harder than ever. They face a constant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers and their even more important obligations to be good parents. The Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I was privileged to sign into law as president in 1993.
Since then about 15 million people have taken advantage of it - and I've met a lot of them all across this country. I ask you to extend that law to cover 10 million more workers and to give parents time off when they have to go see their children's teachers or take them to the doctor.
Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work. Last year I co-hosted the very first White House conference on child care with one of our foremost experts - America's first lady.
From all corners of America, we heard the same message, without regard to region or income or political affiliation: We've got to raise the quality of child care. We've got to make it safer. We've got to make it more affordable. So here's my plan.
Help families to pay for child care for a million more children.
Scholarships and background checks for child care workers and a new emphasis on early learning. Tax credits for businesses that provide child care for their employees, and a larger child-care tax credit for working families.
Now, if you pass my plan, what this means is a family of four with an income of $35,000 and high child-care costs will no longer pay a single penny of federal income tax.
You know, I think this is such a big issue with me because of my own personal experience. I have often wondered how my mother, when she was a young widow, would have been able to go away to school and get an education and come back and support me if my grandparents hadn't been able to take care of me.
She and I were really very lucky. How many other families have never had that same opportunity?
We don't know the answer to that question. But we do know the answer should be. Not a single American family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love.
A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe schools, and safe neighborhoods. We pursued a strategy of more police, tougher punishments, smarter prevention, with crime fighting partnerships with local law enforcement and citizen groups where the rubber hits the road.
I can report to you tonight that it's working. Violent crime is down. Robbery is down. Assault is down. Burglary is down. For five years in a row, all across America.
Now, we need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on our streets.
And again, I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more prosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs and guns and drugs and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life.
And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after-school programs.
I think every American should know that most juvenile crime is committed between the hours of 3 in the afternoon and 8 at night.
We can keep so many of our children out of trouble in the first place if we give them someplace to go other than the streets, and we ought to do it.
Drug use is on the decline. I thank General McCaffrey for his leadership and I thank this Congress for passing the largest anti-drug budget in history. Now I ask you to join me in a groundbreaking effort to hire 1,000 new border patrol agents and to deploy the most sophisticated available new technologies to help close the door on drugs at our borders.
Police, prosecutors and prevention programs - good as they are - they can't work if our court system doesn't work.
Today there are large numbers of vacancies in our federal courts. Here is what the Chief Justice of the United States wrote: "Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice."
I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea and vote on the highly qualified nominees before you, up or down.
We must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world. On the eve of a new century we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security. But make no mistake about it. Today's possibilities are not tomorrow's guarantees.
America must stand against the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism. We must combat an unholy axis of new threats from terrorists, international criminals and drug traffickers. These 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of information and ideas and people, and they will be all the more lethal if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands.
To meet these challenges, we are helping to write international rules of the road for the 21st century protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating those who do not.
Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO.
For 50 years, NATO contained communism and kept America and Europe secure. Now these three formerly communist countries have said yes to democracy. I ask the Senate to say yes to them, our new allies.
By taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century.
Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and their mission in Bosnia.
This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to Sarajevo with Senator and Mrs. Dole and a bipartisan congressional delegation.
We saw children playing in the streets, where two years ago they were hiding from snipers and shells. The shops were filled with food. The cafes were alive with conversation.
The progress there is unmistakable, but it is not yet irreversible. To take firm root, Bosnia's fragile peace still needs the support of American and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June.
I think Senator Dole actually said it best. He said: "This is like being ahead in the fourth quarter of a football game. Now is not the time to walk off the field and forfeit the victory."
I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla.
They're very proud of what they're doing in Bosnia and we're all very proud of them. One of those brave soldiers is sitting with the first lady tonight, Army Sergeant Michael Tolbert. His father was a decorated Vietnam vet. After college in Colorado, he joined the Army. Last year he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia.
Thank you very much, Sergeant, for what you represent.
Please stand up.
In Bosnia and around the world, our men and women in uniform always do their mission well. Our mission must be to keep them well trained and ready, to improve their quality of life and to provide the 21st century weapons they need to defeat any enemy.
I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction. This year, four decades after it was first proposed by President Eisenhower, a comprehensive nuclear test ban is within reach.
By ending nuclear testing, we can help to prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons and make it more difficult for non-nuclear states to build them.
I'm pleased to announce that four former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff - Generals John Shaliskasvili, Colin Powell, and David Jones and Admiral William Crowe - have endorsed this treaty. And I ask the Senate to approve it this year.
Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them.
Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade and much of his nation's wealth not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and the missiles to deliver them.
The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire Gulf War. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission.
I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein: You cannot defy the will of the world.
And when I say to him, you have used weapons of mass destruction before.
We are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.
Last year the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to protect our soldiers and citizens from poison gas. Now we must act to prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror. The Biological Weapons Convention has been in effect for 23 years now. The rules are good, but the enforcement is weak.
We must strengthen it with a new international inspection system to detect and deter cheating.
In the months ahead, I will pursue our security strategy with old allies in Asia and Europe and new partners from Africa to India and Pakistan, from South America to China.
And from Belfast to Korea to the Middle East, America will continue to stand with those who stand for peace.
Finally, it's long past time to make good on our debt to the United Nations.More and more, we are working with other nations to achieve common goals.
If we want America to lead, we've got to set a good example. As we see so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can also share our burdens. In this new era, our freedom and independence are actually enriched, not weakened, by our increasing interdependence with other nations. But we have to do our part.
Our founders set America on a permanent course toward a more perfect union. To all of you, I say it is a journey we can only make together, living as one community.
First, we have to continue to reform our government, the instrument of our national community. Everyone knows elections have become too expensive, fueling a fundraising arms race. This year, by March the 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold.
Let's be clear - a vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for soft money and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year.
But - at least equally important, we have to address the real reason for the explosion in campaign costs - the high cost of media advertising.
For the folks watching at home, those were the groans of pain in the audience. I will formally request that the Federal Communications Commission act to provide free or reduced cost television time for candidates to observe spending limits voluntarily.
The airwaves are a public trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy.
Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, we've reduced the federal payroll by 300,000 workers; cut 16,000 pages of regulation; eliminated hundreds of programs; and improved the operations of virtually every government agency. But we can do more.
Like every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRS. We need some changes there.
New citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers.
Last year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of Representatives passed sweeping IRS reforms. This bill must not now languish in the Senate.
Tonight, I ask the Senate - Follow the House. Pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business. I hope to goodness before I finish I can think of something to say follow the Senate on so I'll be out of trouble.
A nation that lives as a community must value all its communities.
For the past five years, we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to inner city and poor rural areas with community development banks, more commercial loans into poor neighborhoods, clean-up of polluted sites for development.
Under the continued leadership of the vice president, we propose to triple the number of empowerment zones to give business incentives to invest in those areas.
We should - thank you. We should also give poor families more help to move into homes of their own. And we should use tax cuts to spur the construction of more low-income housing.
Last year, this Congress took strong action to help the District of Columbia. Let us renew our resolve to make our capital city a great city for all who live and visit here.
Our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas. They are still the gateways for new immigrants, from every continent, who come here to work for their own American dreams.
Let's keep our cities going strong into the 21st century. They're a very important part of our future.
Our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe, the water they drink, the earth they will inherit. Last year, we put in place the toughest ever controls on smog and soot. We moved to protect Yellowstone, the Everglades, Lake Tahoe. We expanded every community's right to know about toxics that threaten their children.
Just yesterday, our food safety plan took effect using new science to protect consumers from dangers like E. coli and salmonella.
Tonight I ask you to join me in launching a new clean water initiative, a far reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes, and our coastal waters for our children.
Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action. The vast majority of scientists have concluded unequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses at some point in the next century, we'll disrupt or climate and put our children and grandchildren at risk.
This past December, America led the world to reach a historic agreement committing our nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market forces, new technologies, energy efficiency.
We have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6 billion in tax cuts and research and development to encourage innovation, renewable energy, fuel-efficient cars, energy-efficient homes. Every time we have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have told us it would hurt the economy. Well, today our economy is the strongest in a generation. And our environment is the cleanest in a generation. We have always found a way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time.
And when it comes to global warming, we'll do it again.
Finally, community means living by the defining American value, the ideal heard round the world: That we're all created equal. Throughout our history, we haven't always honored that ideal, and we've never fully lived up to it. Often, it is easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common. It may be easier, but it's wrong.
What we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America becomes truly one nation - what do we have to do? We're becoming more and more diverse. Do you believe we can become one nation?
The answer cannot be to dwell in our differences, but to build on our shared values. We all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility. We all want our children to grow up in a world where their talents are matched by their opportunities.
I have launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our common interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us from becoming one America.
Let us begin by recognizing what we still must overcome. Discrimination against any American is unAmerican.
We must vigorously enforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask you help to end the backlog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sixty thousand of our fellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should act now to end their wait.
We should also recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward building one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans - without regard to race.
When we open the doors of college to all Americans, when we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs available to people from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all parents have the child care they need, we're helping to build one nation.
We in this chamber and in this government must do all we can to address the continuing American challenge to build one America. But we'll only move forward if all our fellow citizens - including every one of you at home watching tonight - is also committed to this cause.
We must work together, learn together, live together, serve together. On the forge of common enterprise, Americans of all backgrounds can hammer out a common identity.
We see it today in the United States military, in the Peace Corps, in AmeriCorps.
Wherever people of all races and backgrounds come together in a shared endeavor and get a fair chance, we do just fine. With shared values and meaningful opportunities and honest communications and citizen service, we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect.
We are many. We must be one.
In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium. How will we mark that passage? It just happens once every thousand years.
This year, Hillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote America's creativity and innovation and to preserve our heritage and culture into the 21st century.
Our culture lives in every community, and every community has places of historic value that tell our stories as Americans. We should protect them. I am proposing a public/private partnership to advance our arts and humanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving America's treasures, great and small.
And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future.
Now, think about this - the entire store of human knowledge now doubles every five years. In the 1980s, scientists identified the gene causing cystic fibrosis. It took nine years.
Last year, scientists located the gene that caused Parkinson's Disease in only nine days. Within a decade, gene chips will offer a road map for prevention of illness throughout a lifetime.
Soon, we will be able to carry all the phone calls on Mother's Day on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair. A child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22nd century.
Tonight as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st century research fund for pathbreaking scientific inquiry, the largest funding increase in history for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Cancer Institute.
We have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes. I ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that finally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases.
As important as all this scientific progress is, we must continue to see that science serves humanity, not the other way around. We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American. And we must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities and ban the cloning of human beings.
We should enable all the world's people to explore the far reaches of cyberspace. Think of this - the first time I made a State of the Union speech to you, only a handful of physicists used the World Wide Web - literally, just a handful of people.
Now, in schools and libraries, homes and businesses, millions and millions of Americans surf the net every day. We must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. But we also must make sure that we protect the exploding global commercial potential of the Internet. We can do the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids.
For one thing, I asked Congress to step up support for building the next generation Internet. It's getting kind of clogged, you know? And the next generation Internet will operate at speeds up to 1,000 times faster than today.
Even as we explore this inner space in the new millennium, we're going to open new frontiers in outer space. Throughout all history, human kindness had only one place to call home - our planet Earth.
Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16 countries will build a foothold in the heavens.
The international space station, with its vast expanses, scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential. And this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat missions and one five-hour space flight that changed the world, will return to the heavens. Godspeed, John Glenn.
John, you will carry with you America's hopes.
And on your uniform once again, you will carry America's flag marking the unbroken connection between the deeds of America's past and the daring of America's future.
Nearly 200 years ago, a tattered flag - its broad stripes and bright stars still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle - moved Francis Scott Key to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope - the words that became our national anthem.
Today, that star spangled banner, along with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are on display just a short walk from here. They are America's treasures and we must also save them for the ages.
I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images and the words that are the old and continuing glory of America. An America that has continued to rise through every age against every challenge, a people of great works and greater possibilities, who have always, always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation. To widen the circle of opportunity. To deepen the meaning of our freedom. To form that more perfect union.
Let that be our gift to the 21st century.
God bless you and God bless the United States.

Abstract: But with barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to rest. It is a time to build -to build the America within reach. An America where everybody has a chance to get ahead with hard work, where every citizen can live in a safe community, where families are strong, schools are good and all our young people can go on to college. An America where scientists find cures for diseases from diabetes to Alzheimer's to AIDS. An America where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach every book ever written, every painting ever painted, every symphony ever composed. Where government provides opportunity and citizens honor the responsibility to give something back to their communities. An America which leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity. This is the America we have begun to build. This is the America we can leave to our children, if we join together to finish the work at hand.

Full text: Text of President Clinton's State of the Union address as delivered:
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress, distinguished guests and my fellow Americans, since the last time we met in this chamber, America has lost two patriots and fine public servants. Though they served on opposite sides of the aisle, representatives Walter Capps and Sonny Bono shared a deep love for this House and unshakable commitment to improving the lives of all our people.
In the past few weeks, they've both been eulogized. Tonight, I think we should begin by sending a message to their families and their friends that we celebrate their lives and give thanks for their service to our nation.
For 209 years, it has been the president's duty to report to you on the state of the union.
Because of the hard work and high purpose of the American people, these are good times for America. We have more than 14 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 24 years, the lowest core inflation in 30 years.
Incomes are rising and we have the highest home ownership in history. Crime has dropped for a record five years in a row, and the welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in 27 years.
Our leadership in the world is unrivaled. Ladies and gentlemen, the state of our union is strong.
But with barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to rest. It is a time to build -to build the America within reach. An America where everybody has a chance to get ahead with hard work, where every citizen can live in a safe community, where families are strong, schools are good and all our young people can go on to college.
An America where scientists find cures for diseases from diabetes to Alzheimer's to AIDS. An America where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach every book ever written, every painting ever painted, every symphony ever composed.
Where government provides opportunity and citizens honor the responsibility to give something back to their communities. An America which leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity. This is the America we have begun to build. This is the America we can leave to our children, if we join together to finish the work at hand.
Let us strengthen our nation for the 21st century.
Rarely have Americans lived through so much change in so many ways in so short a time. Quietly, but with gathering force, the ground has shifted beneath our feet, as we have moved into an information age, a global economy, a truly new world.
For five years now we have met the challenge of these changes as Americans have at every turning point in our history, by renewing the very idea of America. Widening the circle of opportunity. Deepening the meaning of our freedom. Forging a more perfect union.
We shaped a new kind of government for the Information Age.
I thank the vice president for his leadership and the Congress for its support in building a government that is leaner, more flexible, a catalyst for new ideas and, most of all, a government that gives the American people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives.
We have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government is the enemy and those who say government is the answer. My fellow Americans, we have found a third way. We have the smallest government in 35 years, but a more progressive one. We have a smaller government, but a stronger nation.
We are moving steadily toward an even stronger America in the 21st century, an economy that offers opportunity, a society rooted in responsibility, and a nation that lives as a community.
First, Americans in this chamber and across our nation have pursued a new strategy for prosperity: Fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and spur growth. Investments in education and skills and science and technology and transportation to prepare our people for the new economy. New markets for American products and American workers.
When I took office, the deficit for 1998 was projected to be $357 billion and heading higher. This year, our deficit is projected to be $10 billion and heading lower.
Thank you. Thank you.
For three decades, six presidents have come before you to warn of the damage deficits pose to our nation. Tonight I come before you to announce that the federal deficit, once so incomprehensibly large that it had 11 zeros, will be simply zero.
Thank you.
I will submit to Congress for 1999 the first balanced budget in 30 years.
Thank you.
And, if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget this year, four years ahead of schedule.
You can all be proud of that because turning a sea of red ink into black is no miracle. It is the product of hard work by the American people and of two visionary actions in Congress - the courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent.
And the truly historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement passed by this Congress.
Here's the really good news. If we maintain our resolve, we will produce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see.
We must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk reopening the deficit.
Last year, together we enacted targeted tax cuts so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in 20 years.
My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and new tax cuts, targeted to the needs of working families.
For education. For child care. For the environment. But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet this test. Approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit.
Now if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple, four-word answer: Save Social Security first.
Tonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus, that's every penny of any surplus, until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.
Let us say - let us say to all Americans watching tonight - whether you're 70 or 50 or whether you just started paying into the system - Social Security will be there when you need it.
Let us make this commitment. Social Security first. Let's do that - together.
I also want to say that all the American people who are watching us tonight should be invited to join in this discussion.
In facing these issues squarely. In forming a true consensus on how we should proceed. We'll start by conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the country. And I hope that lawmakers of both parties will participate.
We'll hold the White House conference on Social Security in December. And one year from now, I will convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic, bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation: A Social Security system that is strong in the 21st century.
In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity. Because these times are good, we can afford to take one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for their families.
We should raise the minimum wage.
The information age is first and foremost an information age in which education will start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime. Last year, from this podium, I said that education has to be our highest priority. I laid out a 10-point plan to move us forward and urged all of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door.
Since then, this Congress, across party lines, and the American people, have responded, in the most important year for education in a generation. Expanding public school choice. Opening the way to 3,000 new charter schools. Working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway. Committing to expand Head Start to a million children. Launching America Reads. Sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8-year-olds can read.
Last year, I proposed and you passed 220,000 new Pell grant scholarships for deserving students.
Student loans, already less expensive and easier to repay, now you get to deduct the interest.
Families all over America now can put their savings into new tax-free education IRAs. And this year, for the first two years of college, families will get a $1,500 tax credit - a Hope Scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition.
And for junior and senior year, graduate school and job training, there is a lifetime learning credit. You did that and you should be very proud of it.
And because of these actions, I have something to say to every family listening to us tonight. Your children can go on to college. If you know a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up. She can go on to college. If you know a young couple struggling with bills, worried they won't be able to send their children to college, tell them not to give up - their children can go on to college.
If you know somebody who's caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up - he can go on to college.
Because of the things that have been done, we can make college as universal in the 21st century as high school is today.
And my friends, that will change the face and future of America.
We have opened wide the doors of the world's best system of higher education. Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the world's best as well.
By raising standards, raising expectations and raising accountability. Thanks to the actions of this Congress last year, we will soon have for the very first time a voluntary national test based on national standards in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math. Parents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the basics. And every parent already knows the key - good teachers and small classes.
Tonight, I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grades. My balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 new teachers who pass the state competency test. Now, with these teachers - listen, with these teachers, we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first, second and third grades to an average of 18 students a class all across America.
Now, if I got the math right, more teachers, teaching smaller classes requires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax cut to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools.
We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors.
It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.
Last year - last year in Chicago, they made that decision not to hold our children back, but to lift them up. Chicago stopped social promotion, and started mandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up.
I propose to help other communities follow Chicago's lead. Let's say to them: Stop promoting children who don't learn and we will give you the tools to make sure they do.
I also asked this Congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to disadvantaged children, starting in the sixth grade, so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they, too, will be able to go on to college.
As we enter the 21st century, the global economy requires us to seek opportunity not just at home but in all the markets of the world. We must shape this global economy, not shrink from it.
In the last five years we have led the way in opening new markets with 240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the proud stamp, Made in the USA.
Today, record-high exports account for fully one-third of our economic growth. I want to keep them going because that's the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer, more stable world.
Now, all of you know, whatever your views are, that I think this is a great opportunity for America. I know there is opposition to more comprehensive trade agreements.
I have listened carefully, and I believe that the opposition is rooted in two fears. First, that our trading partners will have lower environmental and labor standards, which will give them an unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favors, even if there's more business.
And second, that if we have more trade, more of our workers will lose their jobs and have to start over. I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around the world.
I have made it abundantly clear that it should be a part of our trade agenda, but we cannot influence other countries' decisions if we send them a message that we're backing away from trade with them.
This year, I will send legislation to Congress and ask other nations to join us to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all - abusive child labor.
We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left behind by the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may have nothing to do with trade.
That's why we have more than doubled funding for training dislocated workers since 1993, and if my new budget is adopted, we will triple funding.
That's why we must do more and more quickly to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason.
You know, we help communities in a special way when their military base closes. We ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes.
Again, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training programs we have today into one single GI Bill for workers - a simple skills grant so people can on their own move quickly to new jobs, to higher incomes and brighter futures.
Now, we all know in every way in life, change is not always easy. But we have to decide whether we're going to try to hold it back and hide from it or reap its benefits.
And remember the big picture here. While we've been entering into hundreds of new trade agreements, we've been creating millions of new jobs.
So this year, we will forge new partnerships with Latin America, Asia and Europe. And we should pass the new African Trade Act. It has bipartisan support.
I will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiating authority necessary to open more new markets, create more new jobs, which every president has had for two decades.
You know, whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive, the world's economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent. Today an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere.
Recent months have brought serious financial problems to Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and beyond.
Now why should Americans be concerned about this?
First, these countries are our customers. If they sink in a recession, they won't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them. Second, they're also our competitors. So if their currencies lose their value and go down, then the price of their goods will drop, flooding our market and others with much cheaper goods which makes it a lot tougher four our people to compete.
And finally, they are our strategic partners. Their stability bolsters our security.
The American economy remains sound and strong and I want to keep it that way. But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world's economies, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible is the right thing to do for America and the right thing to do for a safer world.
Our policy is clear. No nation can recover if it does not reform itself.
But when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform, we should help them do it. So I call on Congress to renew America's commitment to the International Monetary Fund.
And I think we should say to all the people we're trying to represent here that preparing for a far-off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder until the clouds are just overhead.
A strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility.
A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare. We can be proud that after decades of finger pointing and failure, together we ended the old welfare system. And we're now replacing welfare checks with paychecks.
Last year after a record four-year decline in welfare rolls, I challenged our nation to move two million more Americans off welfare by the year 2000. I'm pleased to report we have also met that goal -two full years ahead of schedule.
This is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual courage, persistence and hope.
For 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Ind., was on and off welfare.
Today, she's a dispatcher with a van company. She's saved enough money to move her family into a good neighborhood, and she's helping other welfare recipients go to work. Elaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare revolution. There are millions like her all across America and I'm happy she could join the first lady tonight. Elaine, we're very proud of you. Please stand up.
We still have a lot more to do - all of us - to make welfare reform a success. Providing child care, helping families move closer to available jobs, challenging more companies to join our welfare-to-work partnership, increasing child support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty to support their own children.
I also want to thank Congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard, and I hope you will finish that job this year.
We have to make it possible for all hard-working families to meet their most important responsibilities. Two years ago, we helped guarantee that Americans can keep their health insurance when they change jobs. Last year, we extended health care to up to five million children.
This year, I challenge Congress to take the next historic steps.
A hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans. These plans save money and they can improve care. But medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants.
I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a consumer bill of rights that says this:
You have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest.
You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need.
You have the right to emergency room care wherever and whenever you need it.
You have the right to keep your medical records confidential.
Now, traditional care or managed care, every American deserves quality care.
Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance. Some are retired. Some are laid off. Some lose their coverage when their spouses retire.
After a lifetime of work, they are left with nowhere to turn.
So I ask the Congress, let these hard-working Americans buy into the Medicare system. It won't add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless.
Next, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health threat that they face - an epidemic of teen smoking, spread by multimillion dollar marketing campaigns.
I challenge Congress - let's pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that will improve public health, protect our tobacco farmers and change the way tobacco companies do business forever. Let's do what it takes to bring teen smoking down.
Let's raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next 10 years with penalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to our children.
Tomorrow, like every day, 3,000 children will start smoking, and 1,000 will die early as a result. Let this Congress be remembered as the Congress that saved their lives.
In the new economy, most parents work harder than ever. They face a constant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers and their even more important obligations to be good parents. The Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I was privileged to sign into law as president in 1993.
Since then about 15 million people have taken advantage of it - and I've met a lot of them all across this country. I ask you to extend that law to cover 10 million more workers and to give parents time off when they have to go see their children's teachers or take them to the doctor.
Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work. Last year I co-hosted the very first White House conference on child care with one of our foremost experts - America's first lady.
From all corners of America, we heard the same message, without regard to region or income or political affiliation: We've got to raise the quality of child care. We've got to make it safer. We've got to make it more affordable. So here's my plan.
Help families to pay for child care for a million more children.
Scholarships and background checks for child care workers and a new emphasis on early learning. Tax credits for businesses that provide child care for their employees, and a larger child-care tax credit for working families.
Now, if you pass my plan, what this means is a family of four with an income of $35,000 and high child-care costs will no longer pay a single penny of federal income tax.
You know, I think this is such a big issue with me because of my own personal experience. I have often wondered how my mother, when she was a young widow, would have been able to go away to school and get an education and come back and support me if my grandparents hadn't been able to take care of me.
She and I were really very lucky. How many other families have never had that same opportunity?
We don't know the answer to that question. But we do know the answer should be. Not a single American family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love.
A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe schools, and safe neighborhoods. We pursued a strategy of more police, tougher punishments, smarter prevention, with crime fighting partnerships with local law enforcement and citizen groups where the rubber hits the road.
I can report to you tonight that it's working. Violent crime is down. Robbery is down. Assault is down. Burglary is down. For five years in a row, all across America.
Now, we need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on our streets.
And again, I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more prosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs and guns and drugs and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life.
And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after-school programs.
I think every American should know that most juvenile crime is committed between the hours of 3 in the afternoon and 8 at night.
We can keep so many of our children out of trouble in the first place if we give them someplace to go other than the streets, and we ought to do it.
Drug use is on the decline. I thank General McCaffrey for his leadership and I thank this Congress for passing the largest anti-drug budget in history. Now I ask you to join me in a groundbreaking effort to hire 1,000 new border patrol agents and to deploy the most sophisticated available new technologies to help close the door on drugs at our borders.
Police, prosecutors and prevention programs - good as they are - they can't work if our court system doesn't work.
Today there are large numbers of vacancies in our federal courts. Here is what the Chief Justice of the United States wrote: "Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice."
I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea and vote on the highly qualified nominees before you, up or down.
We must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world. On the eve of a new century we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security. But make no mistake about it. Today's possibilities are not tomorrow's guarantees.
America must stand against the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism. We must combat an unholy axis of new threats from terrorists, international criminals and drug traffickers. These 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of information and ideas and people, and they will be all the more lethal if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands.
To meet these challenges, we are helping to write international rules of the road for the 21st century protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating those who do not.
Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO.
For 50 years, NATO contained communism and kept America and Europe secure. Now these three formerly communist countries have said yes to democracy. I ask the Senate to say yes to them, our new allies.
By taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century.
Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and their mission in Bosnia.
This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to Sarajevo with Senator and Mrs. Dole and a bipartisan congressional delegation.
We saw children playing in the streets, where two years ago they were hiding from snipers and shells. The shops were filled with food. The cafes were alive with conversation.
The progress there is unmistakable, but it is not yet irreversible. To take firm root, Bosnia's fragile peace still needs the support of American and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June.
I think Senator Dole actually said it best. He said: "This is like being ahead in the fourth quarter of a football game. Now is not the time to walk off the field and forfeit the victory."
I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla.
They're very proud of what they're doing in Bosnia and we're all very proud of them. One of those brave soldiers is sitting with the first lady tonight, Army Sergeant Michael Tolbert. His father was a decorated Vietnam vet. After college in Colorado, he joined the Army. Last year he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia.
Thank you very much, Sergeant, for what you represent.
Please stand up.
In Bosnia and around the world, our men and women in uniform always do their mission well. Our mission must be to keep them well trained and ready, to improve their quality of life and to provide the 21st century weapons they need to defeat any enemy.
I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction. This year, four decades after it was first proposed by President Eisenhower, a comprehensive nuclear test ban is within reach.
By ending nuclear testing, we can help to prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons and make it more difficult for non-nuclear states to build them.
I'm pleased to announce that four former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff - Generals John Shaliskasvili, Colin Powell, and David Jones and Admiral William Crowe - have endorsed this treaty. And I ask the Senate to approve it this year.
Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them.
Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade and much of his nation's wealth not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and the missiles to deliver them.
The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire Gulf War. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission.
I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein: You cannot defy the will of the world.
And when I say to him, you have used weapons of mass destruction before.
We are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.
Last year the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to protect our soldiers and citizens from poison gas. Now we must act to prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror. The Biological Weapons Convention has been in effect for 23 years now. The rules are good, but the enforcement is weak.
We must strengthen it with a new international inspection system to detect and deter cheating.
In the months ahead, I will pursue our security strategy with old allies in Asia and Europe and new partners from Africa to India and Pakistan, from South America to China.
And from Belfast to Korea to the Middle East, America will continue to stand with those who stand for peace.
Finally, it's long past time to make good on our debt to the United Nations.More and more, we are working with other nations to achieve common goals.
If we want America to lead, we've got to set a good example. As we see so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can also share our burdens. In this new era, our freedom and independence are actually enriched, not weakened, by our increasing interdependence with other nations. But we have to do our part.
Our founders set America on a permanent course toward a more perfect union. To all of you, I say it is a journey we can only make together, living as one community.
First, we have to continue to reform our government, the instrument of our national community. Everyone knows elections have become too expensive, fueling a fundraising arms race. This year, by March the 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold.
Let's be clear - a vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for soft money and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year.
But - at least equally important, we have to address the real reason for the explosion in campaign costs - the high cost of media advertising.
For the folks watching at home, those were the groans of pain in the audience. I will formally request that the Federal Communications Commission act to provide free or reduced cost television time for candidates to observe spending limits voluntarily.
The airwaves are a public trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy.
Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, we've reduced the federal payroll by 300,000 workers; cut 16,000 pages of regulation; eliminated hundreds of programs; and improved the operations of virtually every government agency. But we can do more.
Like every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRS. We need some changes there.
New citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers.
Last year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of Representatives passed sweeping IRS reforms. This bill must not now languish in the Senate.
Tonight, I ask the Senate - Follow the House. Pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business. I hope to goodness before I finish I can think of something to say follow the Senate on so I'll be out of trouble.
A nation that lives as a community must value all its communities.
For the past five years, we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to inner city and poor rural areas with community development banks, more commercial loans into poor neighborhoods, clean-up of polluted sites for development.
Under the continued leadership of the vice president, we propose to triple the number of empowerment zones to give business incentives to invest in those areas.
We should - thank you. We should also give poor families more help to move into homes of their own. And we should use tax cuts to spur the construction of more low-income housing.
Last year, this Congress took strong action to help the District of Columbia. Let us renew our resolve to make our capital city a great city for all who live and visit here.
Our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas. They are still the gateways for new immigrants, from every continent, who come here to work for their own American dreams.
Let's keep our cities going strong into the 21st century. They're a very important part of our future.
Our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe, the water they drink, the earth they will inherit. Last year, we put in place the toughest ever controls on smog and soot. We moved to protect Yellowstone, the Everglades, Lake Tahoe. We expanded every community's right to know about toxics that threaten their children.
Just yesterday, our food safety plan took effect using new science to protect consumers from dangers like E. coli and salmonella.
Tonight I ask you to join me in launching a new clean water initiative, a far reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes, and our coastal waters for our children.
Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action. The vast majority of scientists have concluded unequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses at some point in the next century, we'll disrupt or climate and put our children and grandchildren at risk.
This past December, America led the world to reach a historic agreement committing our nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market forces, new technologies, energy efficiency.
We have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6 billion in tax cuts and research and development to encourage innovation, renewable energy, fuel-efficient cars, energy-efficient homes. Every time we have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have told us it would hurt the economy. Well, today our economy is the strongest in a generation. And our environment is the cleanest in a generation. We have always found a way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time.
And when it comes to global warming, we'll do it again.
Finally, community means living by the defining American value, the ideal heard round the world: That we're all created equal. Throughout our history, we haven't always honored that ideal, and we've never fully lived up to it. Often, it is easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common. It may be easier, but it's wrong.
What we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America becomes truly one nation - what do we have to do? We're becoming more and more diverse. Do you believe we can become one nation?
The answer cannot be to dwell in our differences, but to build on our shared values. We all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility. We all want our children to grow up in a world where their talents are matched by their opportunities.
I have launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our common interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us from becoming one America.
Let us begin by recognizing what we still must overcome. Discrimination against any American is unAmerican.
We must vigorously enforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask you help to end the backlog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sixty thousand of our fellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should act now to end their wait.
We should also recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward building one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans - without regard to race.
When we open the doors of college to all Americans, when we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs available to people from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all parents have the child care they need, we're helping to build one nation.
We in this chamber and in this government must do all we can to address the continuing American challenge to build one America. But we'll only move forward if all our fellow citizens - including every one of you at home watching tonight - is also committed to this cause.
We must work together, learn together, live together, serve together. On the forge of common enterprise, Americans of all backgrounds can hammer out a common identity.
We see it today in the United States military, in the Peace Corps, in AmeriCorps.
Wherever people of all races and backgrounds come together in a shared endeavor and get a fair chance, we do just fine. With shared values and meaningful opportunities and honest communications and citizen service, we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect.
We are many. We must be one.
In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium. How will we mark that passage? It just happens once every thousand years.
This year, Hillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote America's creativity and innovation and to preserve our heritage and culture into the 21st century.
Our culture lives in every community, and every community has places of historic value that tell our stories as Americans. We should protect them. I am proposing a public/private partnership to advance our arts and humanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving America's treasures, great and small.
And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future.
Now, think about this - the entire store of human knowledge now doubles every five years. In the 1980s, scientists identified the gene causing cystic fibrosis. It took nine years.
Last year, scientists located the gene that caused Parkinson's Disease in only nine days. Within a decade, gene chips will offer a road map for prevention of illness throughout a lifetime.
Soon, we will be able to carry all the phone calls on Mother's Day on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair. A child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22nd century.
Tonight as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st century research fund for pathbreaking scientific inquiry, the largest funding increase in history for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Cancer Institute.
We have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes. I ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that finally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases.
As important as all this scientific progress is, we must continue to see that science serves humanity, not the other way around. We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American. And we must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities and ban the cloning of human beings.
We should enable all the world's people to explore the far reaches of cyberspace. Think of this - the first time I made a State of the Union speech to you, only a handful of physicists used the World Wide Web - literally, just a handful of people.
Now, in schools and libraries, homes and businesses, millions and millions of Americans surf the net every day. We must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. But we also must make sure that we protect the exploding global commercial potential of the Internet. We can do the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids.
For one thing, I asked Congress to step up support for building the next generation Internet. It's getting kind of clogged, you know? And the next generation Internet will operate at speeds up to 1,000 times faster than today.
Even as we explore this inner space in the new millennium, we're going to open new frontiers in outer space. Throughout all history, human kindness had only one place to call home - our planet Earth.
Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16 countries will build a foothold in the heavens.
The international space station, with its vast expanses, scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential. And this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat missions and one five-hour space flight that changed the world, will return to the heavens. Godspeed, John Glenn.
John, you will carry with you America's hopes.
And on your uniform once again, you will carry America's flag marking the unbroken connection between the deeds of America's past and the daring of America's future.
Nearly 200 years ago, a tattered flag - its broad stripes and bright stars still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle - moved Francis Scott Key to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope - the words that became our national anthem.
Today, that star spangled banner, along with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are on display just a short walk from here. They are America's treasures and we must also save them for the ages.
I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images and the words that are the old and continuing glory of America. An America that has continued to rise through every age against every challenge, a people of great works and greater possibilities, who have always, always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation. To widen the circle of opportunity. To deepen the meaning of our freedom. To form that more perfect union.
Let that be our gift to the 21st century.
God bless you and God bless the United States.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Ignoring the sex scandal that has rocked his administration, President Clinton outlined an ambitious national agenda last night in a State of the Union address designed to serve notice that he wants to be an activist president until the day he leaves office.
The signature proposal of the speech was Clinton's pledge to use "every penny" of an expected $200 billion budget surplus over the next five years to help ensure Social Security solvency for the tens of millions of baby boomers who will soon begin retiring.
"What should we do with this projected surplus?" Clinton said. "I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first!"
The hall was packed, as is customary, but this year members of Congress were intensely curious about how Clinton would conduct himself a week after being accused of having had a sexual relationship with a White House intern.
Hours before he addressed the joint session of Congress, his personal secretary, Betty Currie, had testified to a grand jury looking into the president's sexual behavior -- and possible perjury and obstruction of justice charges against him.
Clinton began somewhat tentatively, but buoyed by the reception -- applause more than 90 times during a speech that lasted an hour and 12 minutes -- he appeared to relax noticeably as he went on.
His remarks -- and his delivery -- seemed designed to elicit the strongest and most positive response from the audience in the House chamber.
He referred repeatedly to the accomplishments that he and Congress had made together, including last year's historic balanced budget agreement.
Clinton began by paying tribute to two California congressmen who died recently, one a Democrat, Walter Holden Capps, the other a Republican, Sonny Bono.
Then, near the end of his speech, he singled out Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, who will soon return to outer space at age 77.
"Godspeed, John Glenn," he said, repeating the historic line uttered by Mission Control when America's first man to orbit Earth was launched in 1962.
At another point, the president lauded the contribution his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has made on the issue of child care. Looking at her from the podium, the president referred to her as "America's first lady," then mouthed the words "Thank you." Gazing down from the visitors' gallery, she beamed back.
Clinton hailed the strength of the economy and focused on a six-year record of peace, prosperity and achievement, outlining an exhaustive list of challenges still facing the nation. He also issued a stern warning to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein not to continue his defiance of United Nations weapons inspectors.
"With barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to rest; it is a time to build the America within reach," he said.
Even before the current controversy, Clinton's speech had been intended to shape the way historians would view his legacy.
White House officials also saw it as a way of establishing the nation's spending priorities for the years ahead, even though most of the initiatives he outlined last night had been announced previously and none require large outlays of tax dollars.
The speech dealt with an array of issues, ranging from racial tensions to global climate change.
Some, such as assistance to communities hard-hit by factory closings, were pet Democratic issues; others, such as reform of the Internal Revenue Service, were tailored for Republicans.
Among the highlights he proposed:
* Raising the minimum wage again. White House officials said it might be next week before a figure is announced. The minimum wage is $5.15 an hour; congressional Democrats have proposed increasing it by 50 cents an hour in each of the next three years.
* A new clean-water initiative. Clinton wants to help states control runoff from farms and urban areas that have been blamed for toxic contamination, such as last summer's Pfiesteria outbreak in Maryland. The plan would create incentives to encourage farmers to adopt techniques to help protect water quality.
* A $1.15 billion increase in funding for biomedical research and a 50 percent increase in the budget for the National Institutes of Health over the next five years.
* Calling for a halt in the campaign fund-raising "arms race." Clinton asked Congress to approve the McCain-Feingold measure, which would bar unlimited "soft-money" campaign contributions. The president also said he would ask the Federal Communications Commission to provide free or reduced-cost air time for candidates in return for the government's granting of new digital TV licenses to broadcasters.
* Challenging the Congress to pass a comprehensive tobacco settlement that would raise cigarette prices $1.50 a pack over 10 years and target teen-age smoking. Noting that 3,000 young Americans will begin smoking tomorrow, Clinton threw down this gauntlet: "Let this Congress be remembered as the Congress that saved their lives."
* Repeating his call for additional day care subsidies for poor working families. He also wants to expand the Head Start program and increase child-care tax credits for families that earn less than $60,000 and for small businesses.
* Allowing Americans as young as 55 who lose their health insurance to receive Medicare. "It won't add a dime to the deficit," he said. "But the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless."
Republicans who heard this laundry list disputed that Clinton could expand Medicare -- or do much of what he promised -- without significantly increasing government spending and regulation.
"The president seems to think that big government can solve all your children's problems if you will just give government more of your money -- and more control over your lives," Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said in the Republican response.
"The typical family pays more than 38 percent of its income in taxes. That's nearly 40 cents of every dollar. And yet President Clinton now wants the government to spend billions of dollars more. But I don't have to tell you -- if the government spends more, you'll wind up getting taxed more. You know that. He knows that."
So far, the Republican-led Congress is divided over what to do with any budget surplus. Clinton's plan would have the effect of using the extra money to pay down the national debt, which some Republicans favor.
The president has taken pains to assert -- in the face of widespread skepticism -- that his spending plans and tax credits, including incentives for education, child care and environmental protection, would pay for themselves over time.
Seeking to avoid an ideological fight on Social Security, Clinton vowed to conduct bipartisan forums all over the country and a White House conference on the issue next December in hopes that whatever Social Security plan emerges would be a consensus.
The plan on Social Security received a mixed greeting on Capitol Hill. A top aide to Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said that most Democrats -- especially Daschle himself -- would greet the proposal with "great enthusiasm."
But some Republican leaders were skeptical that Clinton would follow through. Michele Davis, a spokesman for House Republican Leader Dick Armey, said Clinton mentioned Social Security in last year's State of the Union but seldom brought it up again until now.
"This is something that's going to take a little more presidential leadership than one mention a year," she said.
Rep. Wayne T. Gilchrest, a Republican from the Eastern Shore, called the proposal "a very positive statement" that he believes would launch a serious debate on reforming Social Security.
"I wouldn't say it will be warmly greeted," Gilchrest said, "but when the president suggests it in the State of the Union, it becomes a priority, and it becomes a priority for this Congress."
Turning to foreign policy, Clinton made a strong pitch for Congress to increase funding for the International Monetary Fund -- the lead agency involved in trying to halt the Asian financial crisis.
"Today, an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere," the president warned.
Asian countries are America's customers, competitors and strategic partners, and the turmoil there must be softened as much as possible, he said, adding: "Preparing for a far-off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder until the clouds are just overhead."
Clinton also announced that the United States would lead an international effort to toughen rules against the proliferation and use of germ warfare. Countries that belong to the Biological Weapons Convention would be required to disclose any facilities that could be used to develop such weapons and to agree to a tough new inspection system.
On the most pressing foreign policy issue, the tense stalemate with Iraq, Clinton avoided an explicit threat of military action. But he warned Saddam Hussein that his efforts to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear weaponry and block U.N. weapons inspections would not be tolerated.
"I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein: You cannot defy the will of the world," the president said, as members of both parties rose to their feet, applauding.
On this point, Lott was in complete agreement. Alluding obliquely to the crisis threatening Clinton's presidency, the Republican leader echoed Clinton's warning to Iraq:
"Let me make one thing clear to Saddam Hussein -- or anyone else who needs to be told," Lott said. "Despite any current controversy, this Congress will vigorously support the president in full defense of America's interests throughout the world."
Clinton is not the first embattled president to deliver a State of the Union message.
Twenty-four years ago, at the height of the furor over Watergate, Richard M. Nixon came into the hall to rousing support from Republicans but near-silence from Democrats. Nixon vowed to hang tough, saying, "One year of Watergate is enough." By August, he had resigned.

Twenty-four years ago, at the height of the furor over Watergate, Richard M. Nixon came into the hall to rousing support from Republicans but near-silence from Democrats. Nixon vowed to hang tough, saying, "One year of Watergate is enough." By August, he had resigned.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Ignoring the sex scandal that has rocked his administration, President Clinton outlined an ambitious national agenda last night in a State of the Union address designed to serve notice that he wants to be an activist president until the day he leaves office.
The signature proposal of the speech was Clinton's pledge to use "every penny" of an expected $200 billion budget surplus over the next five years to help ensure Social Security solvency for the tens of millions of baby boomers who will soon begin retiring.
"What should we do with this projected surplus?" Clinton said. "I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first!"
The hall was packed, as is customary, but this year members of Congress were intensely curious about how Clinton would conduct himself a week after being accused of having had a sexual relationship with a White House intern.
Hours before he addressed the joint session of Congress, his personal secretary, Betty Currie, had testified to a grand jury looking into the president's sexual behavior -- and possible perjury and obstruction of justice charges against him.
Clinton began somewhat tentatively, but buoyed by the reception -- applause more than 90 times during a speech that lasted an hour and 12 minutes -- he appeared to relax noticeably as he went on.
His remarks -- and his delivery -- seemed designed to elicit the strongest and most positive response from the audience in the House chamber.
He referred repeatedly to the accomplishments that he and Congress had made together, including last year's historic balanced budget agreement.
Clinton began by paying tribute to two California congressmen who died recently, one a Democrat, Walter Holden Capps, the other a Republican, Sonny Bono.
Then, near the end of his speech, he singled out Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, who will soon return to outer space at age 77.
"Godspeed, John Glenn," he said, repeating the historic line uttered by Mission Control when America's first man to orbit Earth was launched in 1962.
At another point, the president lauded the contribution his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has made on the issue of child care. Looking at her from the podium, the president referred to her as "America's first lady," then mouthed the words "Thank you." Gazing down from the visitors' gallery, she beamed back.
Clinton hailed the strength of the economy and focused on a six-year record of peace, prosperity and achievement, outlining an exhaustive list of challenges still facing the nation. He also issued a stern warning to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein not to continue his defiance of United Nations weapons inspectors.
"With barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to rest; it is a time to build the America within reach," he said.
Even before the current controversy, Clinton's speech had been intended to shape the way historians would view his legacy.
White House officials also saw it as a way of establishing the nation's spending priorities for the years ahead, even though most of the initiatives he outlined last night had been announced previously and none require large outlays of tax dollars.
The speech dealt with an array of issues, ranging from racial tensions to global climate change.
Some, such as assistance to communities hard-hit by factory closings, were pet Democratic issues; others, such as reform of the Internal Revenue Service, were tailored for Republicans.
Among the highlights he proposed:
* Raising the minimum wage again. White House officials said it might be next week before a figure is announced. The minimum wage is $5.15 an hour; congressional Democrats have proposed increasing it by 50 cents an hour in each of the next three years.
* A new clean-water initiative. Clinton wants to help states control runoff from farms and urban areas that have been blamed for toxic contamination, such as last summer's Pfiesteria outbreak in Maryland. The plan would create incentives to encourage farmers to adopt techniques to help protect water quality.
* A $1.15 billion increase in funding for biomedical research and a 50 percent increase in the budget for the National Institutes of Health over the next five years.
* Calling for a halt in the campaign fund-raising "arms race." Clinton asked Congress to approve the McCain-Feingold measure, which would bar unlimited "soft-money" campaign contributions. The president also said he would ask the Federal Communications Commission to provide free or reduced-cost air time for candidates in return for the government's granting of new digital TV licenses to broadcasters.
* Challenging the Congress to pass a comprehensive tobacco settlement that would raise cigarette prices $1.50 a pack over 10 years and target teen-age smoking. Noting that 3,000 young Americans will begin smoking tomorrow, Clinton threw down this gauntlet: "Let this Congress be remembered as the Congress that saved their lives."
* Repeating his call for additional day care subsidies for poor working families. He also wants to expand the Head Start program and increase child-care tax credits for families that earn less than $60,000 and for small businesses.
* Allowing Americans as young as 55 who lose their health insurance to receive Medicare. "It won't add a dime to the deficit," he said. "But the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless."
Republicans who heard this laundry list disputed that Clinton could expand Medicare -- or do much of what he promised -- without significantly increasing government spending and regulation.
"The president seems to think that big government can solve all your children's problems if you will just give government more of your money -- and more control over your lives," Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said in the Republican response.
"The typical family pays more than 38 percent of its income in taxes. That's nearly 40 cents of every dollar. And yet President Clinton now wants the government to spend billions of dollars more. But I don't have to tell you -- if the government spends more, you'll wind up getting taxed more. You know that. He knows that."
So far, the Republican-led Congress is divided over what to do with any budget surplus. Clinton's plan would have the effect of using the extra money to pay down the national debt, which some Republicans favor.
The president has taken pains to assert -- in the face of widespread skepticism -- that his spending plans and tax credits, including incentives for education, child care and environmental protection, would pay for themselves over time.
Seeking to avoid an ideological fight on Social Security, Clinton vowed to conduct bipartisan forums all over the country and a White House conference on the issue next December in hopes that whatever Social Security plan emerges would be a consensus.
The plan on Social Security received a mixed greeting on Capitol Hill. A top aide to Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said that most Democrats -- especially Daschle himself -- would greet the proposal with "great enthusiasm."
But some Republican leaders were skeptical that Clinton would follow through. Michele Davis, a spokesman for House Republican Leader Dick Armey, said Clinton mentioned Social Security in last year's State of the Union but seldom brought it up again until now.
"This is something that's going to take a little more presidential leadership than one mention a year," she said.
Rep. Wayne T. Gilchrest, a Republican from the Eastern Shore, called the proposal "a very positive statement" that he believes would launch a serious debate on reforming Social Security.
"I wouldn't say it will be warmly greeted," Gilchrest said, "but when the president suggests it in the State of the Union, it becomes a priority, and it becomes a priority for this Congress."
Turning to foreign policy, Clinton made a strong pitch for Congress to increase funding for the International Monetary Fund -- the lead agency involved in trying to halt the Asian financial crisis.
"Today, an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere," the president warned.
Asian countries are America's customers, competitors and strategic partners, and the turmoil there must be softened as much as possible, he said, adding: "Preparing for a far-off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder until the clouds are just overhead."
Clinton also announced that the United States would lead an international effort to toughen rules against the proliferation and use of germ warfare. Countries that belong to the Biological Weapons Convention would be required to disclose any facilities that could be used to develop such weapons and to agree to a tough new inspection system.
On the most pressing foreign policy issue, the tense stalemate with Iraq, Clinton avoided an explicit threat of military action. But he warned Saddam Hussein that his efforts to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear weaponry and block U.N. weapons inspections would not be tolerated.
"I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein: You cannot defy the will of the world," the president said, as members of both parties rose to their feet, applauding.
On this point, Lott was in complete agreement. Alluding obliquely to the crisis threatening Clinton's presidency, the Republican leader echoed Clinton's warning to Iraq:
"Let me make one thing clear to Saddam Hussein -- or anyone else who needs to be told," Lott said. "Despite any current controversy, this Congress will vigorously support the president in full defense of America's interests throughout the world."
Clinton is not the first embattled president to deliver a State of the Union message.
Twenty-four years ago, at the height of the furor over Watergate, Richard M. Nixon came into the hall to rousing support from Republicans but near-silence from Democrats. Nixon vowed to hang tough, saying, "One year of Watergate is enough." By August, he had resigned.

Abstract: For 209 years it has been the president's duty to report to you on the state of the union. Because of the hard work and high purpose of the American people, these are good times for America.

Crime has dropped for a record five years in a row, and the welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in 27 years. Our leadership in the world is unrivaled. Ladies and gentlemen, the state of our union is strong. We must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk reopening the deficit. Last year, together we enacted targeted tax cuts so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in 20 years. My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and new tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families: for education, for child care, for the environment. . . . And because of these actions, I have something to say to every family listening to us tonight: Your children can go on to college. If you know a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up, she can go on to college. If you know a young couple struggling with bills, worried they won't be able to send their children to college, tell them not to give up, their children can go on to college. If you know somebody who's caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up, he can go on to college. . . .

Full text: ¬† STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's State of the Union Address last night:
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans: . . .
For 209 years it has been the president's duty to report to you on the state of the union. Because of the hard work and high purpose of the American people, these are good times for America. We have more than 14 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 24 years, the lowest inflation in 30 years, incomes are rising and we have the highest home ownership in history. Crime has dropped for a record five years in a row, and the welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in 27 years. Our leadership in the world is unrivaled. Ladies and gentlemen, the state of our union is strong.
But with barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to rest. It is a time to build -- to build the America within our reach. . . .
Rarely have Americans lived through so much change in so many ways in so short a time. Quietly, but with gathering force, the ground has shifted beneath our feet as we have moved into an information age, a global economy, a truly new world.
For five years now, we have met the challenge of these changes as Americans have at every turning point in our history, by renewing the very idea of America, widening the circle of opportunity, deepening the meaning of our freedom, forging a more perfect union. . . .
We have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government is the enemy and those who say government is the answer. My fellow Americans, we have found a third way. We have the smallest government in 35 years, but a more progressive one. We have a smaller government but a stronger nation. Even better days ahead
We are moving steadily toward an even stronger America in the 21st century -- an economy that offers opportunity, a society rooted in responsibility, and a nation that lives as a community. . . .
When I took office, the deficit for 1998 was projected to be $357 billion, and heading higher. This year, our deficit is projected to be $10 billion, and heading lower. . . . The federal deficit, once so incomprehensively large that it had 11 zeros, will be simply zero. . . . I will submit to Congress, for 1999, the first balanced budget in 30 years. . . .
And if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget this year -- four years ahead of schedule. . . .
We must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk reopening the deficit. Last year, together we enacted targeted tax cuts so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in 20 years. My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and new tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families: for education, for child care, for the environment. . . .
If we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll then have a sizeable surplus in the years that immediately follow.
What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first. . . .
Tonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus -- that's every penny of any surplus -- until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century. . . .
Let us say to all Americans watching tonight, whether you're 70 or 50, or whether you just started paying into the system, Social Security will be there when you need it. . . .
In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity. Because these times are good, we can afford to take one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for their families. We should raise the minimum wage. . . .
Last year, from this podium, I said that education has to be our highest priority. I laid out a ten-point plan to move us forward and urged all of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door. Progress on education
Since then, this Congress . . . and the American people have responded . . . -- expanding public school choice, opening the way to 3,000 charter schools, working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway, committing to expand Head Start to a million children, launching America Reads, sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8-year-olds can read.
Last year I proposed -- and you passed -- 220,000 new Pell Grant scholarships for deserving students. Student loans, already less expensive and easier to repay -- now you get to deduct the interest. Families all over America now can put their savings into new, tax-free education IRAs. And this year, for the first two years of college, families will get a $1,500 tax credit -- a Hope Scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition. And for junior and senior year, graduate school, and job training, there is a lifetime learning credit. . . .
And because of these actions, I have something to say to every family listening to us tonight: Your children can go on to college. If you know a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up, she can go on to college. If you know a young couple struggling with bills, worried they won't be able to send their children to college, tell them not to give up, their children can go on to college. If you know somebody who's caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up, he can go on to college. . . .
We must make our public elementary and secondary schools the world's best as well -- by raising standards, raising expectations and raising accountability. . . .
Every parent already knows the key: good teachers and small classes. Tonight, I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grades. . . . My balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 new teachers who have passed the state competency tests. Now with these teachers . . . we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first, second and third grades to an average of 18 students a class all across America.
If I've got the math right, more teachers teaching smaller classes requires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax cut to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools.
We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools. . . . Let's shape global economy
As we enter the 21st century, the global economy requires us to seek opportunity not just at home, but in all the markets of the world. We must shape this global economy, not shrink from it. . . . This is a great opportunity for America. I know there is opposition to more comprehensive trade agreements. . . . I believe that the opposition is rooted in two fears: first, that our trading partners will have lower environmental and labor standards, which will give them an unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favors, even if there's more business; and second, that if we have more trade, more of our workers will lose their jobs and have to start over.
I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around the world. . . . I have made it abundantly clear that it should be a part of our trade agenda. . . .
This year I will send legislation to Congress, and ask other nations to join us, to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all -- abusive child labor.
We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left behind with the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may have nothing to do with trade. . . . That's why we must do more . . . to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason. . . .
I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training programs we have today into one single GI Bill for Workers, a simple skills grant so people can, on their own, move quickly to new jobs, to higher incomes and brighter futures. . . .
I will also renew my request for the fast track negotiating authority necessary to open more new markets and create more new jobs, which every President has had for two decades. . . .
You know, whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive, the world's economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent. Today, an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere. Recent months have brought serious financial problems to Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and beyond.
Now why should Americans be concerned about this?
First, these countries are our customers. If they sink into recession, they won't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them. Second, they're also our competitors, so if their currencies lose their value and go down, then the price of their goods will drop, flooding our market and others with much cheaper goods, which makes it a lot tougher for our people to compete. And finally, they are our strategic partners. Their stability bolsters our security. . . . Value work, not welfare
The American economy remains sound and strong, and I want to keep it that way. But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world's economies, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible is the right thing to do for America, and the right thing to do for a safer world. . . . A strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility. A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare. We could be proud that after decades of finger-pointing and failure, together we ended the old welfare system. . . .
We still have a lot more to do, all of us, to make welfare reform a success: providing child care, helping families move closer to available jobs, challenging more companies to join our Welfare to Work Partnership, increasing child-support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty to support their own children. I also want to thank Congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard. And I hope you will finish that job this year. . . .
A hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans. These plans save money, and they can improve care. But medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors -- not insurance company accountants.
I urge this Congress to . . . write into law a consumer bill of rights that says this: You have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest. You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need. You have the right to emergency room care wherever and whenever you need it. You have the right to keep your medical records confidential. . . .
Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance. Some are retired. Some are laid off. Some lose their coverage when their spouses retire. After a lifetime of work, they're left with nowhere to turn. So I ask the Congress, let these hard-working Americans buy into the Medicare system. . . .
Next, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health threat that they face: an epidemic of teen smoking spread by multimillion dollar marketing campaigns. I challenge Congress: Let's pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that will improve public health, protect our tobacco farmers, and change the way tobacco companies do business forever. . . .
Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work. . . . So here's my plan: Help families to pay for child care for a million more children; scholarships and background checks for child-care workers, and a new emphasis on early learning; tax credits for businesses that provide child care for their employees; and a larger child-care tax credit for working families. . . . If you pass my plan, what this means is that a family of four with an income of $35,000 and high child-care costs will no longer pay a single penny of federal income tax. . . .
A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe schools, and safe neighborhoods. . . . I can report to you tonight that . . . violent crime is down, robbery is down, assault is down, burglary is down for five years in a row all across America.
Now, we need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on our streets. Again, I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more prosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs and guns and drugs and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life.
And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after school programs. . . . Federal courts need help
Police, prosecutors, and prevention programs -- good as they are, they can't work if our court system doesn't work. Today there are large numbers of vacancies in our federal courts. Here is what the Chief Justice of the United States wrote: "Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice." I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea and vote on the highly qualified nominees before you, up or down. . . . We must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world. On the eve of a new century, we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security. But make no mistake about it; today's possibilities are not tomorrow's guarantees. America must stand against the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism. We must combat an unholy excess of new threats from terrorists, international criminals and drug traffickers. . . .
Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO. . . . By taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century.
Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and their mission in Bosnia. . . . This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to Sarajevo with Senator and Mrs. Dole and a bipartisan congressional delegation. We saw children playing in the streets where, two years ago, they were hiding from snipers and shells. The shops were filled with food. The cafes were alive with conversation. The progress there is unmistakable; but it is not yet irreversible. . . .
I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction. . . . Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons, and the outlaw states, terrorists, and organized criminals seeking to acquire them.
Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade . . . developing nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them.
The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, `You cannot defy the will of the world,' and when I say to him, `You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.' . . . Let's get square with the UN
Finally, it's long past time to make good on our debt to the United Nations. . . .
Everyone knows elections have become too expensive, fueling a fund-raising arms race. This year, by March the 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold. Let's be clear: A vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for soft money and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year.
But at least equally important, we have to address the real reason for the explosion in campaign costs -- the high cost of media advertising. . . . I will formally request that the Federal Communications Commission act to provide free or reduced-cost television time for candidates who observe spending limits voluntarily. The airwaves are a public trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy. . . .
Like every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRS. We need some changes there: new citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers. . . . Tonight I ask the Senate: Follow the House; pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business. . . .
A nation that lives as a community must value all its communities. For the past five years, we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to inner city and poor rural areas with community development banks, more commercial loans into poor neighborhoods, cleanup of polluted sites for development. . . . We should also give poor families more help to move into homes of their own, and we should use tax cuts to spur the construction of more low-income housing. . . . A clean water challenge
I ask you to join me in launching a new Clean Water initiative, a far-reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes, and our coastal waters for our children.
Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action. . . . I propose $6 billion in tax cuts, in research and development, to encourage innovation, renewable energy, fuel-efficient cars, energy-efficient homes. . . . We have always found a way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time. And when it comes to global warming, we'll do it again. . . .
We're becoming more and more and more diverse. . . . I've launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our common interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us from becoming one America.
Let us begin by recognizing what we still must overcome. Discrimination against any American is un-American. We must vigorously enforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask your help to end the backlog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. . . .
We should also recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward building one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans, without regard to race. When we open the doors of college to all Americans, when we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs available to people from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all parents have the child care they need, we're helping to build one nation. . . . Make science serve humanity
With shared values and meaningful opportunities and honest communications and citizen service, we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect. We are many; we must be one. . . .
As important as scientific progress is, we must continue to see that science serves humanity, not the other way around. We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American, and we must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities, and ban the cloning of human beings. . . .
I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images and the words that are the old and continuing glory of America, an America that has continued to rise through every age against every challenge, a people of great works and greater possibilities, who have always, always, found the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation, to widen the circle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of our freedom, to form that more perfect union.
Let that be our gift to the 21st century.
God bless you, and God bless the United States.

Abstract: The government plans to make more extensive use of green taxation to protect the environment, Michael Meacher, the environment minister, warned yesterday. Mr Meacher told a seminar organised by the Institute for Public Policy Studies : "Until you hit people's pockets, a lot of people won't take [the environment] seriously." But Mr Meacher stressed the government had no intention of increasing companies' and individuals' overall tax burden. Instead, it believed that new taxes to discourage pollution and the waste of natural resources should be accompanied by a cut in national insurance contributions to "bear down on unemployment".

Full text: The government plans to make more extensive use of green taxation to protect the environment, Michael Meacher, the environment minister, warned yesterday.
He said the government, agreed that "green taxes were the only measures likely to have sufficient impact to change [people's] behaviour in many circumstances".
Mr Meacher told a seminar organised by the Institute for Public Policy Studies : "Until you hit people's pockets, a lot of people won't take [the environment] seriously."
Without such measures, he said, the government would be unable to implement its ambitious strategy for curbing fossil fuel consumption, which is linked to climate change.
Gordon Brown, the chancellor, has undertaken to consider green taxes for possible inclusion in the March Budget.
But Mr Meacher stressed the government had no intention of increasing companies' and individuals' overall tax burden. Instead, it believed that new taxes to discourage pollution and the waste of natural resources should be accompanied by a cut in national insurance contributions to "bear down on unemployment".
He laid down four other conditions for green taxation, modelled on the pioneering landfill tax introduced in October 1996:
* Government should explain clearly what the environmental goals of a given tax are.
* Some of the revenues raised should be "earmarked" for purposes that have widespread support, such as "cutting payroll taxes or improving public transport".
* Government should give the public and business plenty of advance warning and consult widely on whatever it is proposing.
* Government should use some of the money raised to help people and industry adapt to the tax at the same time as they cut pollution and waste.
Mr Meacher conceded that the Treasury did not accept the principle of "hypothetication" - earmarking some revenue raised for specific purposes, such as environmental protection.
Although there would be a continuing need for regulations, for instance to ban hazardous substances, he said, "green fiscal measures must be a main instrument" to achieve environmental protection.
Until then, it would remain "cheaper for many companies to adopt capital intensive and highly polluting processes rather than less polluting processes which entail high levels of employment", he said.
Mr Meacher added that Sweden's success in taxing emissions of sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen to tackle air pollution was particularly encouraging. But the government was keen to ensure green taxes did not hurt the poor. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: In 1993 aquiculture produced more than 16 million tons of fish, and the capacity has expanded during the past decade to an annual rate of 10 percent by quantity and 14 percent by value. In 1993 fish farms produced 22 percent of the food fish consumed in the world, and 90 percent of the oysters sold. Prefer salmon? Norwegian salmon farms alone produce 400 million pounds per year. Interestingly, when Green Peace founder Patrick Moore walked away from the group 10 years ago, he believed he was wrapping things up, not jumping ship. Now he is enduring catcalls of "eco-Judas." This is because he wished to return to his native British Columbia to raise salmon. Put me down as one who is skeptical of the politically correct environmental emergencies. So far as I am concerned, except for my own orange and grapefruit trees, I consider other trees as some farmer's cash crop. Fixation on the preservation of the old growth forests is puzzling. If people are really concerned about the need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere they need to replace the old trees with fast-growing young trees. Don't these two statements just say it all! I trained at the University of Michigan and Harvard. Their two main hospitals were headed at the time by physicians. I remember as a lowly resident physician at Massa chusetts General Hospital, one of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world, that I could speak with Dr. John Knowles, the "CEO" (although then known as the chief administrator) at any time. If I had a concern about patient care, he was there to address it. Contrast this with trying to speak with Michael Covert. One is lucky as a staff physician if he can get an appointment in a week. Then, of course, he would have to travel downtown to the high-rent Hollywood 20 complex where the executive offices are. This in itself is a mystery, as there are thousands of empty square feet of potential office space on the main campus of Memorial Hospital. Perhaps the bottom liners on the hospital board should address that issue.

Full text: ¬† Science can fix many problems
The "Cast a wider net" editorial Jan. 17 concentrates only on the dark side without any mention of the fact that aquiculture is already feeding most of Europe from its fish farms, which are not polluted. Genetic engineers have already designed fish for better flavor and color, as well as for faster growth, improved disease resistance and other traits.
Two species of silver carp and grass carp already rank among the most consumed fish worldwide. A specially bred tilapia known as the aquatic chicken takes only six months to reach its harvestable size of about a pound and a half.
In 1993 aquiculture produced more than 16 million tons of fish, and the capacity has expanded during the past decade to an annual rate of 10 percent by quantity and 14 percent by value. In 1993 fish farms produced 22 percent of the food fish consumed in the world, and 90 percent of the oysters sold. Prefer salmon? Norwegian salmon farms alone produce 400 million pounds per year. Interestingly, when Green Peace founder Patrick Moore walked away from the group 10 years ago, he believed he was wrapping things up, not jumping ship. Now he is enduring catcalls of "eco-Judas." This is because he wished to return to his native British Columbia to raise salmon.
This is no reason not to take ocean pollution seriously. But. . . . as a recovering cancer patient I can't afford to fan the flames of technophobia. Although I make constant use of my computer, my affliction was not brain cancer but colon cancer. Nor was it caused by radiation from our electric blanket. It had to be my mother's genes, for that was what she died of.
Put me down as one who is skeptical of the politically correct environmental emergencies. So far as I am concerned, except for my own orange and grapefruit trees, I consider other trees as some farmer's cash crop. Fixation on the preservation of the old growth forests is puzzling. If people are really concerned about the need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere they need to replace the old trees with fast-growing young trees.
American forests now provide the largest harvests in history, and there is more forest land than in 1920. How can this be? Land once devoted to farming wheat and corn can be used more profitably to raise trees.
Finally, what man has polluted, man can clean up. The technology is certainly there. Not too long ago Lake Erie was dying. Today it's alive and well. If the technophobes would stop crying doom, designer microbes would be cleaning up sewage everywhere. The rub is that they'd rather have the issue as a weapon to fight growth. We have plenty of water all around us and there's no reason not to have sufficient fresh water to fill our swimming pools, keep our lawns green and shower for as long as we like.

A time for astronaut economics
John Glenn is going back into space and I'm anxious to hear his report regarding what Mother Earth looks like 30 years later. When he went the first time, the Cold War had things divided between democracy and communism. Today, as futurist-economist Hazel Henderson puts it: "We are united under the new politic - economism."
In Beyond Growth, the Economics of Sustainable Development, Herman Daily talks about fellow economist Kenneth Bouldings' colorful distinction between cowboy economics and astronaut economics. The cowboy of the infinite West lives off of limitless resources with no need to recycle or conserve anything. The astronaut in a small spaceship lives off of tight material cycles, efficient energy use and immediate feedback.
I wonder what sort of feedback we'll get from Sen. Glenn about our spaceship and its atmospheric dump for the products of combustion? Is the blue planet becoming a brown planet?
In a report to the Presidents Council for Sustainable Developments: "Making Sense While Making Money," Amory and Hunter Lovins, co-directors of the Rocky Mountain Institute, write, "Climate change is not the inevitable price of progress, but rather an unnecessary artifact of the uneconomically wasteful use of resources."
They estimate that simply by implementing cost-effective, energy-efficiency measures - that is, measures that pay a better-than-market rate of return - we could eliminate more than half of the threat of global climate change. Another quarter of the problem can be abated by sustainable farming and forestry methods that are about as profitable as current methods, and the rest will disappear thanks to the already mandated replacement of CFCs with new substitutes.
So, if the cost of protecting the atmosphere actually creates jobs, creates wealth, reduces overhead and delivers reinvestable time, isn't this the deal of the century?
Closer to home, the debate rages around the benefits of a "new" fuel called Orimulsion vs. good old liquid petroleum. This reminds me of the scene of the tourist swimming in Big Pass and the cracker fisherman drifting by in his boat, pointing next to the swimmer and asking . . . "Hey, Buddy . . . Uh . . . Is that a shark or a barracuda?"

Physicians, not bottom lines, should run health care
A couple of articles in the Herald-Tribune recently get to the heart of the health care crisis. One was in reference to Columbia-HCA. The upshot was that Dr. Thomas Frist, the CEO, was turning around this albatross created by Richard Scott. He was doing this by downsizing the company and changing its mandate from bigger profits to better patient care. Dr. Frist, a physician and son of the founder of HCA, hopefully has an entirely different ethic than his predecessor, Mr. Scott, an entrepreneur.
A second article was in reference to the appointed replacement for the position on the Sarasota Memorial Hospital Board vacated when Catherine Bowls resigned. (It is regretful that the most patient-oriented and independent member of the board resigned.) The appointee is quoted as saying, "I do not know anything about health care, but I do know the bottom line." A couple of days prior to this, the chairman of the board, in explaining further cuts in staff at Memorial, said, "It's a business."
Don't these two statements just say it all! I trained at the University of Michigan and Harvard. Their two main hospitals were headed at the time by physicians. I remember as a lowly resident physician at Massa chusetts General Hospital, one of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world, that I could speak with Dr. John Knowles, the "CEO" (although then known as the chief administrator) at any time. If I had a concern about patient care, he was there to address it. Contrast this with trying to speak with Michael Covert. One is lucky as a staff physician if he can get an appointment in a week. Then, of course, he would have to travel downtown to the high-rent Hollywood 20 complex where the executive offices are. This in itself is a mystery, as there are thousands of empty square feet of potential office space on the main campus of Memorial Hospital. Perhaps the bottom liners on the hospital board should address that issue.
The care of patients has to be returned to physicians. It has to be taken away from businessmen and entrepreneurs, who know nothing about taking care of sick people, and only know and care about the bottom line. Hospitals, hospital boards, medical insurance decisions and political policy regarding medical care need input from physicians.
To be sure, doctors sometimes exhibit bottom-line tendencies. If people are paying their own bill or have point-of-service insurance, the high fees that doctors charge are an atrocity. The reason is to make up for the equally atrocious low fees of the HMOs and various government programs. This is called cost shifting and is not the solution. The answer is fair fees from the insurers and government agencies.
In spite of remarkable advances in medical technology and drugs, the quality of medical care in this country is on a downward spiral. Until it is realized that the real bottom line in medicine is compassionate, affordable and available care, it will continue to deteriorate. Until the monies are redirected away from the HMO and insurance executives, stockholders and outrageous hospital CEO salaries, toward the care of sick people, we will continue to witness a disgraceful and dangerous deterioration of medical care.

Save something of Earth's resources for tomorrow
My hat is off to the local fishermen who attended a Legislature meeting earlier this month! They conducted themselves very well and made many good points. They all seem to be very hard-working and independent.
I wonder how many of us would be out trying to make a buck at 3 a.m. or trudging across Charlotte Harbor through a squall line to earn a living? All of them deserve our respect . . . and I don't blame them for not wanting a ban on netting in the canals.
I sailed for years out of the home of one of the largest fishing fleets on the East Coast: Point Judith, R.I. That's the place that all of the power squadrons use for their tests because if the sea doesn't get you, then the fog and currents will; it's where men are made out of boys overnight. I've seen men pulling in their nets with decks awash in a foot of white water in seas that one would think were made by the devil himself. I've seen them come back to port covered with ice inches thick . . . just wondering how they made it back.
It takes some special people to do this kind of work.
The recent meeting reminded me of some of the debates back home.
There were many discussions back in 1969 or '70 as to whether or not to open Salt Pond (that's just upstream from where the trawlers were berthed) to recreational and commercial scalloping that season. It appeared to be a bountiful year for these succulent morsels for which the area has been known. The commercial fishermen were arguing for no limits and the recreational ones were arguing for no commercialization. It's not often that one finds a fisherman who is against fishing. This was a fairly small pond and easily scalloped. As it turned out, the recreational scalloper was allowed two bushels (I think) a day and the commercial scalloper, many more. I can remember that fall day when scallop season opened. A person could have walked from shore to shore, there were so many boats out there.
I dredged my two burlap bags full early in the morning and went home to chuck them. They were so good and sweet that every once in a while I rinsed one off and ate it raw.
That was the last season we had it so good. The next year there weren't enough scallops out there even for the recreational fisherman. The bottom cover was gone from all the dredging. . . . The pond never fully recovered.
The Grand Banks have a similar story. The fishermen fought any kind of limits. Now there's so few fish out there many fishermen are talking about a complete ban so the stock can recover.
I can understand why the fishermen want to net in the canals. They admit it's much easier to net there than out in the harbor. Well, I think they've done quite a good job: I no longer hear schools of mullet jumping, just one loner here or there. So maybe if such a ban occurs, it just might extend fishermen's livelihood at least a few more years. That is if the stock can recover.
As I sat there in the meeting last Thursday, I sensed a lot of resentment from the fishermen for those of us who live in the isles. But I think we have more in common than many think. We are here, in the isles, because we love the salt water just as they do. Many of us come from hard-working families, too.

Animal rights and people's
The uproar from the animal rights people about destruction of the raccoons which have become such pests on Lido Key reminds me of a book that was written about 50 years ago by Eric Hoffer entitled The True Believer. He pointed out the harm that can come from single-issue zealots who become gung-ho over issues like vegetarianism, nudism, UFOs, vivisection, etc.
All over the world various animals become pests when their natural predators or their natural habitat is destroyed by increases in the number of humans. In Australia, house cats have become feral and have caused the extinction of nine native animal species. A member of the Australian parliament has suggested that these millions of cats be destroyed and that all house cats be neutered.
We also live in a rural area up north where residential development has been encroaching on the habitat needed by the wildlife. A few years ago we put out salt blocks to attract the deer to our property. Suddenly we have too many deer and they either eat or trample everything we grow. Raccoons have become so numerous that they have become a terrible nuisance. Twice they have entered our house during the winter through the fireplace damper and furnace flue. The raccoons smelled the bird seed stored in my garage and almost tore off the door trying to get at it. An obviously sick raccoon entered our garage in broad daylight and was shot by our county animal control people. It is like living under siege!
The animal rights folks almost universally object to vivisection where animals are used for medical experiments. I feel strongly about this, as I lost a sister who died at 8 months; she was born a "blue baby." Twenty years later my first child was born and she, too, was a blue baby. The doctor said she could die at any moment or could survive to age 12 or 13. There was a chance that her heart valve could close by itself, which it did when she was about 4 months old. The doctor told us at that time (1942) that experiments were being conducted on dogs that might enable doctors to correct such a condition.
If animal-rights advocates had had their way, experiments on the hearts of dogs would never have been allowed and blue babies might routinely die today. Also, those thousands who have benefited from by-pass surgery and transplants might be doomed if the anti-vivisectionists had been in charge.

Siesta Key
Senator explains choice of office
Recent reports have speculated that I may be considered as Jeb Bush's running mate. The fact that - after only three years of public service - statewide speculation exists that I may be well-suited for this post is both remarkable and humbling. As I entered public life three years ago, my goal was to represent my constituents to the best of my ability. I fought hard for the issues the citizens of my district supported. Little was written of the success our district enjoyed, however, the rest of the state took notice.
A recent article poorly construed the analogy relating the choice of lieutenant governor to the winning of an Oscar nomination. I do not consider public service as a prize; it is a duty and a commitment. Further, I have not sought this position as I have told the reporter, but rather I am seeking the office of secretary of state. I believe that my education, background and experience better equip me to serve the citizens of Florida in this position. The policy responsibilities of this office well fit the work that I have done in the Florida Senate.
I look forward to having a great legislative session and a successful campaign for secretary of state. I hope to bring Southwest Florida something that we have not previously enjoyed: representation on the Florida Cabinet.
Lastly and most importantly, I would like to thank the citizens of my district who have been active participants in government and made me a better public official. I may not be a slick career politician like the writer thinks that Jeb needs, but I get results and I think people prefer outsiders who are willing to make a difference, over lifelong politicians.

Full text: If you need a plumber, you call a plumber. But if your concern is global warming, do you call a scientist, a paid lobbyist or a propagandist?
And what do you do if the deadly serious science of global warming contains enough uncertainties that there is a slight chance the hack, the propagandist or the legitimate skeptic is right?
You could begin, says Rob Macintosh of the Pembina Institute, by lopping off the extremists whose agendas, ideologies or profit motives colour their approach to an issue that cries out for understanding but is beset by misinformation, deliberate or misguided.
On the one end, you could lop off the environmental end-of-the- worlders, says Macintosh, executive director of the Alberta-based institute, which specializes in research and policy involving energy and the environment.
And, at the other end, you could dispense with the right-wing extremists who argue just as ferociously that the general consensus on global warming among the world's public and private-sector scientists is a leftist plot -- "junk science," as their well funded Web sites proclaim.
It is easier said than done. The environmental movement may be in disarray, but its fringe element still makes itself heard. And its extremist counterpart on the right-wing fringe has never been so flush with money or so loud.
Financing much of that debate are certain energy-sector companies -- the Western Fuels Association, a giant coalition of coal companies in the United States, is a good example -- that stand to make less money if the world decides to control fossil-fuel emissions to reduce greenhouse gases.
Western Fuels, to its credit, is the most upfront of the bankrollers of the campaign to discount global warming. Its annual reports contain details of its efforts to enlist and fund such well- known "skeptics" on global warming as Patrick Michaels, Robert Balling and Fred Singer.
Other companies have not been so forthcoming.
But journalists and other researchers in the U.S. have discovered, through Internal Revenue Service reports, that the Global Climate Coalition has spent millions of dollars to downplay global warming on behalf of its 50-plus industry members that include the American Petroleum Institute.
SKEPTICS
By now, it is possible to attach a long list of company grants to the "research" offered by most of the self-styled global warming skeptics.
Michaels, for example, has received funding from Western Fuels, the German Coal Mining Association, Edison Electric and Cyprus Minerals.
Balling's sources of funding include the British Coal Association and the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science. Singer, a veteran industry scientist, gets money from a host of companies.
It would be a simple matter if the only challengers of the working hypothesis of global warming were a few hidebound energy companies. They could be dismissed as self-interested parties pursuing the tobacco industry's old strategy of lining up in-house scientists in a war of disinformation that's only intended to delay profit losses.
But it is more complicated than that.
First, there are some independent scientists who are genuine skeptics on global warming issues.
Their work has produced revisions in theory in areas as diverse as the role of cloud vapour in producing greenhouse gases and in the adequacy of computer models in forecasting how much the Earth's mean temperatures will rise as a result of a predicted doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the next century.
Such findings are jumped on by industry-sponsored global warming opponents as proof that climate change is a hoax, a claim that ignores the fact that the modifications in the theory, combined with a growing body of climatic evidence, is reducing the number of genuine skeptics.
Typically, a recent survey among climate scientists in Germany, the U.S. and Canada found a majority believe climate warming has started and that public policy to limit greenhouse gas emissions is a prudent response.
The survey supports other surveys by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, including one that puts the number of global warming skeptics at between 3.5 and five per cent of the world scientific community.
But there is another factor that clouds the scientific debate and perhaps threatens to hijack it -- the well funded U.S. right-wing "think tanks" that see the global warming issue as a leftist environmentalist plot to destroy the world economy.
Their publications, and the work of their scientists, rarely make it into the primary research journals of the mainstream scientists. But they dominate the Internet, which isn't peer reviewed, to the extent that an indiscriminating reader might entertain their claim to be "half" the debate or "the other side" of the issue.
It is a claim to which newspapers are especially vulnerable, given their traditional concern with printing both sides of an issue. Scientists, however, argue that the many streams of thought on global warming have produced a genuine consensus based on real evidence and that it's misleading to accept the claim of a few lobby- scientists and ideologues that they are the "other side" in the debate.
This conjunction of industry funding, ideology-driven think tanks and conservative politics has been a fixture of the U.S. scene. But it is also making inroads in Canada, as evidenced by the Vancouver- based Fraser Institute which is now part of the lecture circuit for the band of skeptics who grace the Web sites of the American think tanks.
The Fraser Institute devoted much of a recent magazine to "a few things you should know about global warming," including an article by Michaels that concludes the "greenhouse scare" is over.
If he can prove that, scientists say, he should run for president of the world. They add that the first scientist who can present evidence showing human activity is not responsible for climate change would be hailed everywhere. Unfortunately the evidence points in the other direction.
A problem for some of the skeptics is that many in the scientific community haven't heard of them, in part because their work is published by organizations like the Independence Institute and Web sites like Junk Science -- and not in the peer-reviewed primary science journals.
"In most scientific journals," says David Schindler, a University of Alberta scientist with a history of publishing ground-breaking research that became mainstream science, "if you put together an argument that's new and novel and that no one accepts, if it's well argued the journal will accept and publish it."
Genuine scientists, not biased in favour of any "truth," will then explore the evidence for the argument. There are, he adds, "scientists so biased that they can't get anything into print."
Schindler says science is vulnerable to distortion by self- interested industries, politicians and ideologues because scientific work involves probabilities and uncertainties, rather than absolute truths.
He notes that scientists reviewing the reports to the UN panel on climate change include Nobel Prize winners and the acknowledged experts.
"The majority of those people reviewing the IPCC data are the best folks we have and they admit they can't predict these things with 100 per cent accuracy."
He says that uncertainty gives those with another agenda the opportunity to wage disinformation campaigns.
In the global warming debate, for example, a few million dollars spent by a heavily polluting industry to prove global warming is "junk science" might cast enough doubt to allow the industry to avoid pollution curbs for another decade.
Such special-interest lobbying has been a feature of global- warming politics for years in the U.S., where some segments of the energy industry regularly trot out everyone from the privately funded think tank to that old specimen -- the industry-funded scientist -- to "prove" global warming is a hoax.
In Canada, it is a more muted fight. One reason, perhaps, is that the public interest is better defined. Special interests, even in an energy-dominated province like Alberta, face a broader front of public skepticism than in the U.S.
But there is another factor. The Canadian energy companies, perhaps more attuned to their broader self-interest, recognize the strong impact global warming could have on other industries and have chosen to temper their positions accordingly.
It is one thing, for example, for an ideology-driven think tank in Washington or Virginia to launch a broadside against environmental lefties.
Schindler notes research evidence suggesting a warming of the Earth's temperature will have a severe impact on farming on the Prairies in the form of warmer and drier weather.
CONTROLS
It could also have a drastic impact on northern forests, a possibility that has persuaded the forest industry -- and its many scientists -- to undertake serious work in emission control and other mitigative measures.
But the insurance industry is perhaps the most worried.
Insurance companies have paid billions of dollars in settlements as a result of recent unusual weather patterns -- a predicted symptom of global warming, many scientists say -- and don't want to be stuck holding the bill.
"We're watching with great interest," says Alan Wood, Alberta spokesperson for the Insurance Bureau of Canada. "We have to look at our dollars and cents. If there is global warming occurring, we'd be fools not to prepare."
While he wishes the skeptics were right, he doesn't believe anyone can afford to stick their head in the sand. "It's a typical interest-group situation" with many of the skeptics, he says. "It's the same as the tobacco industry, the fur lobby. If they're wrong, the potential tragedy is enormous."
Such thinking may serve to temper the U.S-style debate that organizations like the Fraser Institute have tried to import to Canada.
The institute is seeking credibility as a voice of business, but risks alienating its audience with ideological arguments against environmentalists who ignore the everyday reality of companies just outside the institute's walls.
It is one thing to accuse an environmental extremist of perpetrating a hoax. But is the Fraser Institute prepared to launch the same attack on George Weyerhaeuser Jr., president of forestry giant Weyerhaeuser Canada Ltd.?
Weyerhaeuser, who is not regarded as an anti-market lefty, said in a recent speech that "the substantial increase of human-produced greenhouse gas emissions during this century, combined with increased global average temperatures and a higher frequency of climatic disturbances, raises the possibility that humanity is disrupting the natural equilibrium.
"Despite the uncertainty surrounding the issue of global climate change," he said, "there is good reason to adopt a precautionary approach, given the potentially catastrophic ecological and economic impacts."
The precautionary approach accurately describes the position of most of the Canadian energy industry -- coal excepted -- which has embraced the concept of voluntary emission controls. In some cases - - Suncor and TransAlta are good examples -- they have won the respect of environmental activists with technological improvements that will see the rate of increase of Alberta emissions begin to slow in the next 10 years despite a large increase in energy production.
David Manning, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, says the industry has taken the position that global warming represents a credible possibility and a risk that must be managed.
But, he adds, the industry is against forced controls on emissions.
He expects some of its members will push for a more careful look at the evidence for and against global warming if controls are threatened.
THE ROAD TO KYOTO
The recent international treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions has roots that stretch back nearly 100 years:
- 1898 -- Swedish scientist Svante Ahrrenius warns that carbon dioxide emissions could contribute to global warming.
- 1958 -- Charles Keeling, a scientist at an observatory in Hawaii, reports that concentrations of carbon dioxide are rising.
- 1979 -- A world climate conference considers possible human impacts on climate. It called on governments to "foresee and prevent potential man-made changes in climate that might be adverse to the well-being of humanity."
- 1980s -- Throughout the decade, scientists around the world express growing concern about the impact of human activity on climate change. Papers presented at numerous conferences (Villach 1985, Toronto 1988, The Hague 1989) explored the possible link between human pollution and climate.
- 1988 -- Jim Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, testifies in the U.S. Senate that the scientific evidence suggests carbon dioxide emissions were warming the planet. His testimony touched off a policy debate.
Political leaders of the day, including British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, call soon afterwards for the creation of an international body of scientists to investigate the issue.
In the United States, research into the issue is supported on a non-partisan basis by Republican presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
- 1988 -- The United Nations creates the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, at the request of member countries, to assess the state of knowledge about climate change, its potential impacts and possible strategies of response.
- 1990 -- The IPCC releases its first assessment report. This report, reviewed by scientific experts around the world, found broad scientific evidence of climate change. A world climate conference recommends a framework treaty on climate change, calling the issue "a common concern of mankind."
Negotiations on a world treaty are authorized by the UN General Assembly.
- 1992 -- A framework convention on climate change is signed by most of the world's countries in Rio de Janeiro, calling among other things for voluntary controls on greenhouse gas emissions.
- 1995 -- A second assessment report by the IPCC surveys the state of scientific knowledge worldwide and concludes "the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate."
- 1997 -- A conference at Kyoto, Japan, produces commitments by most countries of the world, including Canada, to reduce their emissions by specific amounts by the year 2010.

Abstract: These transient events have rubbed off something more permanent. Somewhat to its collective surprise - and thanks in no small measure to the city's retail, leisure, and arts entrepreneurs - Glasgow has a new buzz about it. It's become a city more and more outsiders want to experience. That has helped to encourage more service companies to bring fresh investment and jobs to Glasgow: first, call-centre activity; now, companies capitalising on the trend to outsource professional business services. And, at last, as the old business boundaries become more and more fluid, Glasgow is no longer regarded as a no-go area for manufacturing investment. Large serviced industrial sites, once the preserve of the new towns, are being prepared at Cambuslang, Cardonald, Robroy-ston, and Springhill. The planners are confident they will quickly fill. That happy outcome, more than any statistical sophistry over short-term trends in employment levels in the city, will prove that Glasgow has begun to claw back employment after the heavy losses of the past 20 years. But if more jobs do return, will the people follow? What a regenerated Glasgow needs above all else is a more balanced population mix and a more resilient local tax base. Bluntly, Glasgow needs to appeal to more middle-class families once more as a place to live. Precisely the kind of people who take full advantage of Glasgow's retail and leisure infrastructure - and a healthy slice of the available jobs too - but who currently live outwith its boundaries because the schools there are better and the quality of life is thought superior. They could be reintroduced to city living by redesignating the main dormitory areas around Glasgow as an integral part of the municipal city.

Full text: WHITHER Glasgow? This week The Herald has tried to dissect and analyse the many challenges and dilemmas facing Scotland's biggest city. Its current strengths and weaknesses. The fresh opportunities it seeks to embrace. And the familiar threats - witness the ongoing loss of population reflected in the latest official figures, projecting a drop below half a million before long - it strives to counter. What shines through the perceptions of Glaswegians we've asked to reflect on the state of their city today is their enduring affection for a metropolis they see as one of the more friendly and open-hearted places on earth.
But while Glasgow has smiled on better than most through the many adversities it has suffered in recent decades, the city and its citizens will need more than a proven ability to grin and bear it if Glasgow is to have a credible sense of civic purpose and direction that will ensure it prospers well into the new millennium. Glasgow needs a set of clearly attainable objectives and a civic leadership - inside and outside the City Chambers - with the vision, commitment, and drive to deliver them. Glasgow also needs recognition, endorsed well beyond its own boundaries, of the key role it has played and must, in our view, continue to play in the economic, social, and cultural life of Scotland as a whole.
For much of the post-war period Scotland's strategists and planners have effectively colluded in Glasgow's gradual decline and decay. Jobs went with the crumbling of the traditional manufacturing base. People followed, abandoning the Clydeside slums for a back and front door and a garden in the new towns. The replacement jobs, many of them exploiting the newer silicon technologies, were directed to equally greenfield campuses next door. That was what the hi-tech tyros of San Jose demanded. That was what the negotiators in Locate in Scotland were happy to offer. Even when successive governments felt they could ignore Glasgow's plight no longer, the regeneration initiatives they devised - like the Gear scheme and the Castlemilk initiative - were housing, not employment, led. Glasgow was never designated an enterprise zone, although its jobs haemorrhage in the eighties and early nineties swamped those of Clydebank, Greenock, and Motherwell combined. In the era of the Scottish Development Agency and Strathclyde region, Glasgow grew to expect preferential treatment on the grounds that the city faced more than its proportionate share of Scotland's problems.
In the era of the Scottish Enterprise network and unitary local authorities, Glasgow is just one of 20 or 30 supplicants queuing up for a slice of the available cake. So, while equivalent English cities coming to terms with a post-industrial future have enjoyed the pump-priming investment of urban development corporations, Glasgow, the would-be tourist destination of choice, is forced to contemplate closing galleries and museums to save money. And Glasgow, the one- time workshop to the world, where the ability to make things defined who you were, is left to contemplate its economic future as the West of Scotland's main service base, a place where half of Scotland might choose to shop, attend a football match or concert, or buy an insurance policy.
The city still managed to flourish its profile from time to time, with the fondly-remembered garden festival of 1988 and the year-long festival as European City of Culture in 1990. Next year there's to be a reprise of the exclamation-mark approach to civic policy, when Glasgow becomes City of Architecture and Design.
These transient events have rubbed off something more permanent. Somewhat to its collective surprise - and thanks in no small measure to the city's retail, leisure, and arts entrepreneurs - Glasgow has a new buzz about it. It's become a city more and more outsiders want to experience. That has helped to encourage more service companies to bring fresh investment and jobs to Glasgow: first, call-centre activity; now, companies capitalising on the trend to outsource professional business services. And, at last, as the old business boundaries become more and more fluid, Glasgow is no longer regarded as a no-go area for manufacturing investment. Large serviced industrial sites, once the preserve of the new towns, are being prepared at Cambuslang, Cardonald, Robroy-ston, and Springhill. The planners are confident they will quickly fill. That happy outcome, more than any statistical sophistry over short-term trends in employment levels in the city, will prove that Glasgow has begun to claw back employment after the heavy losses of the past 20 years. But if more jobs do return, will the people follow? What a regenerated Glasgow needs above all else is a more balanced population mix and a more resilient local tax base. Bluntly, Glasgow needs to appeal to more middle-class families once more as a place to live. Precisely the kind of people who take full advantage of Glasgow's retail and leisure infrastructure - and a healthy slice of the available jobs too - but who currently live outwith its boundaries because the schools there are better and the quality of life is thought superior. They could be reintroduced to city living by redesignating the main dormitory areas around Glasgow as an integral part of the municipal city.
But we doubt whether the new model Labour Party, which fine tunes every policy to the heartbeat of middle Britain, has the stomach for such a head-on fight. So we are not holding our breath. The government could, instead, allow cities like Glasgow to keep more of the business rates raised within their area, an option implicit in New Labour's hotly-contested desire to return to councils the power to levy their own business tax. And if government is serious about protecting the environment and combating climate change, it may, in time, set the cost of commuting between cities and the countryside at a level which reflects the real costs involved. For now there is little evidence of that objective in John Prescott's apparent determination to build thousands of houses in the English greenbelt. But were they ever to materialise, such policy thrusts would clearly benefit Glasgow.
In the shorter term, if the city is to win back more affluent residents, it will have to play a more subtle game of its own devising. It will have to encourage the building within the city of more houses and neighbourhoods with compelling middle-class appeal. Some good progress is being made through the brownfield sites housing initiative to tempt more owner-occupiers to stay within Glasgow's boundaries. But more ambitious schemes are needed. The late Victorian dynamism which created a Pollokshields or a Jordanhill is probably beyond us today.
But opportunities are emerging to think on a bigger scale. For example, the planned closure of Ruchhill Hospital creates a large residential opportunity just north of Glasgow's cosmopolitan West End. Glasgow has had more than its fair share of knocks. But Glasgow still has a great deal going for it. That positive agenda is the one to which we should all now devote our energies and our creativity.

Abstract: Much of the east coast is at risk of serious flooding because of inadequate sea defences and the willingness of planning authorities to approve development of low-lying areas according to Willis Corroon , the insurance broker. In a report published yesterday, the company said that sea walls would need substantially greater investment if they were to be effective. Many were constructed or refurbished in the 1950sfollowing a disaster that swamped the east, drowning 300 people, during the night of January 31 1953.

Full text: Much of the east coast is at risk of serious flooding because of inadequate sea defences and the willingness of planning authorities to approve development of low-lying areas according to Willis Corroon , the insurance broker.
In a report published yesterday, the company said that sea walls would need substantially greater investment if they were to be effective. Many were constructed or refurbished in the 1950sfollowing a disaster that swamped the east, drowning 300 people, during the night of January 31 1953.
The report said, however, that public grants for refurbishment have been decreasing in real terms. This had resulted in reliance on private sector involvement, a trend which may mean spending is ultimately inadequate.
Also, natural flood defences, such as salt marshes, have been reclaimed for agricultural and leisure development.
"Existing sea defences have been designed for certain return periods. But the design parameters may be changing as rises in mean sea levels, increasing storminess and a sinking land mass point to increasing risk of extreme high water levels," said the broker's report.
Most at risk is the east coast of England between the river Humber and Thames estuary. This stretch of coast already has a history of flooding and tidal surges measured at London Bridge have steadily increased.
Global warming may play a role in the bigger surges. The International Panel on Climate Change has estimated that global sea levels are rising by about 6cm every decade because of the thermal expansion of the oceans.
Willis said the increased concentration of housing and other developments on land at risk of flooding would push up the cost of insurance claims.
Britain has not suffered an inundation since 1953, but the cost of wind damage has been rising.
The hurricane which struck southern England in 1987 caused ¬£1.6bn of damage, and the gales which swept across the country earlier this month cost ¬£300m.
The Department of Transport and Environment said development of coastal areas was subject to a government policy designed to minimise the risk of flooding to homes and limit the need for expensive engineering works.
It said the degree of risk involved was carefully considered and that policy was kept under constant review. After the storm, Page 14 Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: Yet Mr. [John Robson] engages in boldfaced denial ("the evidence that the world is getting warmer is feeble, while the evidence that humans are causing it to get warmer is non-existent") and seeks to discredit scientific attempts to study global warming in general, mainly by attacking "models." As an example of how unreliable science really is, Mr. Robson mocks previous scientific concerns about "global cooling." The change in focus of scientific concerns from global cooling to global warming is actually an example of the scientific method in action. In 1971, when a renowned atmospheric scientist called Stephen Schneider expressed concerns about cooling, the contribution of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide was not recognized. The climatological community was more concerned about possible cooling of the planet by particulate pollution than about carbon dioxide- induced warming. The cooling effect of particulate matter was recently demonstrated by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, which caused a transient cooling in 1992-94, even though the 1990s were overall the hottest decade.

Full text: The Citizen's deputy editorial page editor has seen fit to loudly proclaim his wilful ignorance on global warming, not once, but on two occasions ("The Kyoto treaty is worse than useless," Dec. 12 and "My, but we've had a lot of weather lately," Jan. 16).
Evidently, John Robson doesn't read the Citizen very carefully, or else disregards what it prints, because most of the data cited below comes from its pages:
l Last year was the warmest year on record since record-keeping began 130 years ago.
l On a global basis, the 10 warmest years in the last 130 years have all occurred since 1980 and the five warmest since 1990.
l The earth's temperature has risen half a degree Celsius over the last 140 years. Canada's temperature is one degree warmer since 1985.
l The rate of melting of ice caps on mountains in the tropics and subtropics has greatly accelerated in recent decades.
l The freezing level in the Earth's atmosphere (the height where air temperature reaches 0 degrees Celsius) has been gaining altitude since 1970 at a rate approaching five metres each year.
l A six-year study in the Mackenzie Basin has confirmed that the northern permafrost of the region has retreated about 100 kilometres during the last century, and there has been an increase in the depth of the so-called active layer that thaws and melts intermittently. Meteorological records in the region, some of which go back to the 1890s, show average temperatures have risen about one degree C in the last century.
l As a result of the industrial revolution, the atmosphere contains 40 per cent more carbon than its natural level.
l Insurance industry payouts for weather-related damage reached $48 billion U.S. in the 1990s (as of mid-1996), compared to $16 billion for the 1980s.
l In 1996, total property damage in Canada due to weather came to about $ 1.5 billion.
l Before 1987, insured losses from any single natural disaster never exceeded $1 billion; since then 18 natural disasters of at least $1 billion have occurred around the world.
l The intergovernmental Report on Climate Change has noted that the annual insured cost of windstorms worldwide has exploded from $500 million during the 1960s to $11 billion in the early 1990s.
l Canadian health experts note the rate of deaths from malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, rose 42 per cent for men and 25 per cent for women between 1980 and 1990. More and more young people in their 20s and 30s are seen with skin cancers usually found in older people.
Yet Mr. Robson engages in boldfaced denial ("the evidence that the world is getting warmer is feeble, while the evidence that humans are causing it to get warmer is non-existent") and seeks to discredit scientific attempts to study global warming in general, mainly by attacking "models."
As an example of how unreliable science really is, Mr. Robson mocks previous scientific concerns about "global cooling." The change in focus of scientific concerns from global cooling to global warming is actually an example of the scientific method in action.
In 1971, when a renowned atmospheric scientist called Stephen Schneider expressed concerns about cooling, the contribution of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide was not recognized. The climatological community was more concerned about possible cooling of the planet by particulate pollution than about carbon dioxide- induced warming. The cooling effect of particulate matter was recently demonstrated by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, which caused a transient cooling in 1992-94, even though the 1990s were overall the hottest decade.
We now know that carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas. Methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons (CFSs) are also involved in trapping some of the sun's energy near the Earth's surface. When this fact was recognized, the concerns of the climatological community shifted to global warming.
The fact that scientists refocused their concerns does not reflect a failure on the part of science, it illustrates how science works: When new information is acquired, old ideas sometimes change. (For more information on global warming see Paul and Anne Ehrlich, The Betrayal of Science and Reason, 1996, Island Press).
Despite the fact that climate patterns are complex in themselves, and sorting out the effects of human activity is not as simple as Mr. Robson would like it to be, the vast majority of serious scientists believe that the evidence on global warming (some of it cited above) is sufficient to warrant concern.
Most scientists and most thinking laypeople believe that it is wise to take action, and irresponsible to do nothing to reverse deleterious trends. As the Ehrlichs say in their book, you don't have to know the number of grains of sand on a beach to be able to observe that erosion is occurring.
Unfortunately Mr. Robson's misinformation is likely to influence a significant number of people, who, like himself, lack a grasp of the scientific method.
For such people, the evidence for global warming will never be conclusive enough, just as the evidence for declining fish stocks was never conclusive enough for our government.
By the time we have "enough" information, we may be experiencing some of the catastrophic predictions, such as the flooding of low- lying areas due to rising sea levels or serious losses of previously fertile land.
By that time of course, Mr. Robson may be dead or have lived out most of his life.
I wonder if he ever troubles himself with thoughts of what sort of a world his grandchildren might inhabit.

Abstract: Long before last December's global warming conference in Kyoto, we started urging people to stay cool about what's required to buy some cautionary insurance for Mother Earth. One tells you millions will lose jobs and prices will skyrocket because of the cost of converting factories, vehicles, and buildings to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The other side warns you of drowning in Indonesia, fried crops in Iowa, huge storms, forest decline, and pestilence. We've pointed out that the electric power industry has already learned a lot about cutting CO2 emissions. (Some 45 million tons of gases cut in North America.) The more agile firms can now reverse the standard wastage statistic: one-third of fuel produces electricity; two-thirds is wasted. They can now reach 70 percent efficiency.

Full text: ¬† Long before last December's global warming conference in Kyoto, we started urging people to stay cool about what's required to buy some cautionary insurance for Mother Earth.
Don't be panicked by either side.
One tells you millions will lose jobs and prices will skyrocket because of the cost of converting factories, vehicles, and buildings to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The other side warns you of drowning in Indonesia, fried crops in Iowa, huge storms, forest decline, and pestilence.
Both are based on static projections: (1) That the cost of CO2 emission-cutting will remain high. (2) That the private sector will stand still and governments will bicker for years.
We've pointed out that the electric power industry has already learned a lot about cutting CO2 emissions. (Some 45 million tons of gases cut in North America.) The more agile firms can now reverse the standard wastage statistic: one-third of fuel produces electricity; two-thirds is wasted. They can now reach 70 percent efficiency.
But what about the headline subject of this editorial: cars? Their numbers are expected to grow by tens of millions as Chinese, Indians, and Brazilians begin to lead versions of Western lifestyles. So more efficiency on the road is a must - in terms of resources as well as climate change.
We've noted with interest recent announcements by Honda, Toyota, and Saab of new super-efficient engines. One of Honda's (scheduled for late 1998) gets 70 miles per gallon. Another, under development, uses three catalyzers to reduce emissions to about 1/10th what the world's most stringent restrictions (California's) allow.
That's important, because California has hit a setback in selling consumers zero-emission electric cars. Prices are still too high and trips between chargings to short to woo many buyers. GM's two-seat, battery-powered EV-1 found only 300 buyers in a year, well short of the goal of 1,200. State officials are considering whether to add "hybrids," with a small gas engine twinned with an electric motor.
For such cars to become standard, they will have to be reliable enough and cheap enough to attract mass buyers. That means Western consumers buying enough to bring about economies of scale. Then versions for mass markets in developing lands.
None of this is simple. But it's encouraging that major car firms are pouring big money into research on even more thrifty (and alternative-powered) future cars.

Abstract: Western Fuels, to its credit, is the most up-front of the bankrollers of the campaign to discount global warming. Its annual reports have detailed its efforts to enlist and fund such formerly obscure but currently well-known "skeptics" on global warming as Patrick Michaels, Robert Balling and Fred Singer. Typically, a recent survey among climate scientists in Germany, the United States and Canada found that a majority believe climate warming is already under way, and that public policy to limit greenhouse gas emissions is a prudent response. The survey supports other surveys by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), including one that places the number of global warming skeptics at between 3.5 and 5 per cent of the world scientific community. In fact, there has been so little recorded warming, he says, that it is now incumbent on global warming scientists to explain why the climate hasn't warmed up as much as they thought it would.

Full text: Feature on global warming See related stories F4, "Attacking the messengers", F5, "Assessing the skeptics"
If you need a plumber, you call a plumber. But if your concern is global warming, do you call a scientist, a paid lobbyist or a propagandist?
And what do you do if the deadly-serious science of global warming contains enough uncertainties -- as every reputable scientist knows -- that there is a slight chance the hack, the propagandist or the legitimate skeptic might be right?
You could begin, says Rob Macintosh of the Pembina Institute, by lopping off the extremists whose agendas and ideologies -- or profit motives -- colour their whole approach to an issue that cries out for understanding but is beset by misinformation, deliberate or misguided.
On the one end you could lop off the environmental end-of-the- worlders "who say the insects will march forward and trash the place," says Macintosh, executive director of the institute, which specializes in research and policy involving energy and the environment.
On the other end, he says, you could dispense with the right- wing extremists who argue just as ferociously that the general consensus on global warming among the world's public and private- sector scientists is actually a leftist plot -- "junk science," as their well-funded websites proclaim.
It is easier said than done. The environmental movement may be in disarray, but its fringe element still makes itself heard. And its extremist counterpart on the right-wing fringe has never been so flush with money or so loud.
Financing much of that debate are certain companies in the energy sector -- the Western Fuels Association, a giant coalition of coal companies in the United States is a good example -- who stand to make less money if the world decides to control fossil-fuel emissions in an effort to reduce greenhouse gases.
Western Fuels, to its credit, is the most up-front of the bankrollers of the campaign to discount global warming. Its annual reports have detailed its efforts to enlist and fund such formerly obscure but currently well-known "skeptics" on global warming as Patrick Michaels, Robert Balling and Fred Singer.
Other companies have not been so forthcoming. Still, journalists and other researchers in the United States have discovered, through Internal Revenue Service reports, that the Global Climate Coalition has spent millions of dollars to downplay global warming on behalf of its 50-plus industry members (including the American Petroleum Institute).
By now, it is possible to attach a long list of company grants to the "research" offered up by most of the self-styled global warming skeptics. (Michaels has received funding from Western Fuels, the German Coal Mining Association, Edison Electric, Cyprus Minerals. Balling's sources of funding range more exotically to include the British Coal Association and even the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science. Singer, a veteran industry scientist, gets money from a whole host of companies, from ARCOL to Unocol).
It would be a simple matter if the only challengers of the working hypothesis of global warming were a few hidebound energy companies. They could be dismissed as self-interested parties pursuing the tobacco industry's old strategy of lining up in-house scientists in a war of disinformation intended solely to delay profit losses.
But it is more complicated than that. First, there are some independent scientists who are genuine skeptics on global warming issues. Their work has produced revisions in theory in areas as diverse as the role of cloud vapour in producing greenhouse gases, and in the adequacy of computer models in forecasting how much the earth's mean temperatures will rise as a result of a predicted doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the next century.
Such findings are jumped on by the industry-sponsored global warming opponents as final proof that climate change is a hoax -- a claim that ignores the fact that the modifications in the theory, combined with a growing body of climate evidence, serves to reduce the number of genuine skeptics.
Typically, a recent survey among climate scientists in Germany, the United States and Canada found that a majority believe climate warming is already under way, and that public policy to limit greenhouse gas emissions is a prudent response. The survey supports other surveys by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), including one that places the number of global warming skeptics at between 3.5 and 5 per cent of the world scientific community.
But there is another factor that further clouds the scientific debate, and perhaps even threatens to hijack it. That is the entry by well-funded, primarily U.S. right-wing "think tanks" who see the global warming issue as an opportunity to push their campaign against government regulation and what many of them perceive as a leftist environmentalist plot to destroy the world economy.
Their publications, and the work of their scientists, rarely make it into the primary research journals of the mainstream scientists. But they do dominate the Internet, which isn't peer-reviewed, to the extent that an undiscriminating reader might entertain their claim to be "half" the debate or "the other side" of the issue.
It is a claim to which newspapers are especially vulnerable, given their traditional concern with printing "both sides" of an issue. Mainstream scientists, however, argue that the many streams of thought on global warming have produced a genuine consensus based on real evidence, and that it is misleading -- at best -- to accept the claim of a few lobby-scientists and ideologues that they are the "other side" in the debate.
The ideologues who attack global warming as a leftist, "Big Government" and "Big Environment" plot may have little scientific standing -- none, in fact. But 20 minutes on the Internet will produce a slew of them, all feverishly quoting one another: the Hoover Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, the Independence Institute, the Cato Institute, the "Junk Science" website, the Global Climate Coalition, The Science and Environment Policy Project, Sovereignty International, the Eagle Forum, the George C. Marshall Institute.
This is just a small list, but you get the picture. What they have in common is their funding, which comes from private sources; their politics, which is right-wing; and their science, which is suspect to most scientists.
Still, it has produced a harangue of the extremes, reflected recently in the little side-stage skirmishes between environmental fringe groups and right-wing fringe groups at the Kyoto conference on climate change, which were then duly reported from their hotel- room modems back to their websites.
In this harangue, it is almost possible to forget that the science behind global warming is the working reality for most of the world's scientists, and tacitly or openly accepted by most industry (which has to make a go of it on the planet, like the rest of us).
It is just a "so-called consensus," claims Jerry Taylor, the affable but hardly moderate director of natural resources studies at the Cato Institute, one of the more respected right-wing think tanks.
The United Nations-sponsored IPCC report, when you go through it, can account for only a half degree Fahrenheit of warming since the Second World War and hardly supports the conclusion in the report that "the balance of evidence" suggests a human role, he says.
In fact, there has been so little recorded warming, he says, that it is now incumbent on global warming scientists to explain why the climate hasn't warmed up as much as they thought it would.
The Cato Institute's main global warming researcher is Patrick Michaels, the frequent recipient of research money from the coal industry. In the past, Michaels has also edited a journal, funded by Western Fuels, that Michaels once described (in less than scientific language) as "an antidote to the vision of apocalypse promoted by the professional environmental community and the United Nations."
The question of funding is irrelevant, Taylor contends, because the data winds up in public journals where it can be tested. If the data is there, it doesn't matter if "Satan himself" is paying for the research.
In fact, the research of the "skeptics" rarely shows up in the peer-reviewed literature at all. When it is considered for publication, it is usually rejected on scientific grounds, according to numerous scientists who have testified to this effect before public bodies. More typically, the work of the "skeptics" is funded by special interests in industry, printed by a right-wing think tank and then hailed on op-ed pages by right-wing commentators.
A typical example is Fred Singer, one of the most well-known skeptics, whose name is rarely seen in the research journals (except in letters to the editor), but who has received substantial industry funding, runs a webpage and research institute that campaign fiercely against global warming on scientific-ideological grounds, and will soon have a new book out on the subject -- published by the right-wing Independence Institute in Oakland, Calif.
This ready conjunction of industry funding, ideology-driven think tanks and conservative politics has been a fixture of the U.S. scene for years. But it is also making inroads in Canada, as evidenced by the Vancouver-based Fraser Institute which is now part of the lecture circuit for the band of skeptics who grace the websites of the American tanks.
The Fraser Institute, for example, devoted much of a recent magazine to "a few things you should know about global warming," including an article by Michaels that concludes the "greenhouse scare" is over.
If he can prove that, mainstream scientists say, he should run for president of the world. The first scientist able to present actual evidence showing that human activity is not responsible for climate change would be hailed everywhere, they say. Unfortunately the evidence points in the other direction.
A problem for some of the skeptics is that many in the mainstream scientific community haven't heard of them, in part because their work is published mainly by organizations like the Independence Institute and websites like Junk Science -- but not in the peer- reviewed primary science journals.
"In most (scientific) journals," says David Schindler, a University of Alberta scientist with a long history of publishing ground-breaking research that became mainstream science, "if you put together an argument that's new and novel (and) that no one accepts, if it's well-argued the journal will still accept and publish it." Genuine scientists, not biased in favour of any "truth," will then explore the evidence for the argument.
There are, he adds, "scientists out there so biased that they can't get anything into print."
Schindler says the whole discipline of science is vulnerable to distortion by self-interested industries, politicians and ideologues because the very nature of scientific work involves probabilities and uncertainties, rather than absolute truths.
The scientists reviewing the reports to the UN panel on climate change include Nobel prize winners and the acknowledged experts in their fields, he notes.
"My philosophy is there's some people you would go to if you want things done right, and there's some people you would avoid.
"I would say the majority of those people reviewing the IPCC data are the best folks that we have, and they freely admit that they can't predict these things with 100 per cent accuracy. No scientist ever claims that."
It is that uncertainty -- in terms of absolute knowledge -- at the heart of all science that gives those with another agenda the opportunity to wage disinformation campaigns, he says.
In the global warming debate, for example, a few million dollars spent by a heavily polluting industry to prove that global warming is "junk science" might cast enough doubt to allow the industry to avoid pollution curbs for another decade, he says.
Such special-interest lobbying has been a feature of global- warming politics for years in the United States, where some segments of the energy industry regularly trot out everyone from the privately funded think tank to that old specimen -- the industry- funded scientist -- to "prove" that global warming is a hoax.
In Canada it is a more muted fight, at least until now. One reason, perhaps, is that the public interest is better defined. Special interests, even in an energy-dominated province like Alberta, face a broader front of public skepticism than in the United States.
But there is another factor too. The Canadian energy companies, perhaps more attuned to their broader self-interest, recognize the strong impact that global warming could have on other industries working right next door to them, and have chosen to temper their own positions accordingly.
It is one thing, for example, for an ideology-driven think tank in faraway Washington or Virginia to launch a broadside against environmental lefties. But evidence stemming from mainstream research suggests a warming of the earth's temperature will have a severe impact on farming on the Prairies in the form of warmer and drier weather -- not unlike the impact of the warm weather seen earlier this winter, Schindler notes.
It could also have a drastic impact on northern forests, a potentiality that has persuaded the forest industry -- and its many scientists -- to undertake serious work in emission control and other mitigative measures.
But the industry that is perhaps most worried these days is the insurance industry, which has paid out billions of dollars in settlements as a result of recent unusual weather patterns -- a predicted symptom of global warming, according to many scientists -- and don't want to be stuck holding the bill.
"We're watching with great interest," says Alan Wood, Alberta spokesperson for the Insurance Bureau of Canada. "We have to look at our dollars and cents. If there is global warming occurring, we'd be fools not to prepare."
While Wood wishes the skeptics were right, he doesn't believe anyone can afford to stick their head in the sand. "It's a typical interest-group situation" with many of the skeptics, he says.
"It's the same as the tobacco industry, the fur lobby ... If they're wrong, the potential tragedy is enormous."
Such thinking may serve in the end to temper the U.S-style debate that organizations like the Fraser Institute have tried to import into Canada. The institute is seeking credibility as a voice of business, but risks alienating its own audience with ideological arguments against environmentalists that ignore the everyday reality of companies just outside the institute's walls.
It is, after all, one thing to accuse an environmental extremist of perpetrating a hoax. But is the Fraser Institute prepared to launch the same attack on George Weyerhaeuser Jr., president of forestry giant Weyerhaeuser Canada Ltd.?
Weyerhaeuser, who is not regarded as an anti-market lefty, stated in a recent speech that "the substantial increase of human-produced greenhouse gas emissions during this century, combined with increased global average temperatures and a higher frequency of climatic disturbances, raises the possibility that humanity is disrupting the natural equilibrium.
"Despite the uncertainty surrounding the issue of global climate change," he said, "there is good reason to adopt a `precautionary' approach, given the potentially catastrophic ecological and economic impacts."
The precautionary approach accurately describes the position of most of the Canadian energy industry -- coal excepted -- which has embraced the concept of voluntary emission controls. In some cases - - Suncor and TransAlta are good examples -- they have won the respect of environmental activists with technological improvements that will actually see the rate of increase of Alberta emissions begin to slow in the next 10 years, despite a large increase in energy production.
The industry has taken the position that global warming represents a credible possibility and a risk that must be managed, says David Manning, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.
But, he adds, the industry is against forced controls on emissions, and he anticipates that some of its members will be pushing for a more careful look at the evidence for and against global warming if controls are threatened.
All of these considerations are unlikely to still the emissions from the fringe groups, especially those on the right whose websites daily proclaim new "conclusive proof" that global warming is a hoax.
In fact, the fury on the fringes is just beginning to heat up as governments around the world begin to debate measures to control fossil-fuel emissions.
The arguments tend to come so fast and furiously that a new one is placed on the plate even before the last one is dispelled.
* New satellite data proves the Earth isn't warming (No, it proves -- depending on questionable mathematical calculations -- that there has been a slight cooling a mile above the Earth and beyond).
* The Earth has gone through other periods of warming and cooling, Medieval warm spells and Little Ice Ages (Yes, but not in conjunction with carbon dioxide levels whose concentrations are higher now than at any time in the last 160,000 years, according to ice-core data, and which are projected to double again in the next 100 years).
* It was so cold in December 1995 that the evidence for warming can be discredited (In fact, 1995 was the warmest year since systematic instrumental records began to be kept in the 19th century).
And so on. A true skeptic would be advised to consider the source of the information.
"I'm not surprised to see this kind of stuff," says Schindler, whose research on lakes years ago was greeted by industry-sponsored research "proving" that algae produces phosphorus, rather than the other way around.
"It's just that when you look very closely versus the other scientific evidence, I know where I would put my money on who's likely to be right."
If you go to a scientific conference on global warming, he says, "you don't hear these arguments (from the skeptics). These folks don't turn up, or if they do turn up they're too embarrassed to open their mouths."
"I would bet that a lot of these people, deep down, think they're not going to win this argument."
Don't tell that to Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute. "Within the course of another 10 or 15 years, we'll move on to another hysteria and global warming will be forgotten," he says.
THE LONG ROAD TO KYOTO
The recent international treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions has roots that stretch back nearly 100 years:
* 1898 -- Swedish scientist Svante Ahrrenius warns that carbon dioxide emissions could contribute to global warming.
* 1958 -- Charles Keeling, a scientist at an observatory in Hawaii, reports concentrations of carbon dioxide were rising.
* 1979 -- A world climate conference considers possible human impacts on climate. It called on governments to "foresee and prevent potential man-made changes in climate that might be adverse to the well-being of humanity."
* 1980s -- Throughout the decade, scientists worldwide express a growing concern about the impact of human activity on climate change. Papers presented at numerous conferences (Villach 1985, Toronto 1988, The Hague 1989) explored the possible link between human pollution and the climate.
* 1988 -- Jim Hansen, the director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, testifies in the U.S. Senate that the scientific evidence suggested carbon dioxide emissions were warming the planet. His testimony touched off a policy debate.
Political leaders of the day, including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, call for the creation of an international body of scientists to investigate the issue. In the U. S., research into the issue is supported on a non-partisan basis by Republican presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
* 1988 -- The United Nations creates the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), at the request of member countries, to assess the state of knowledge about climate change, the potential impacts and possible strategies of response.
* 1990 -- The IPCC releases its first assessment report. This report, reviewed by scientific experts around the world, found broad scientific evidence of climate change. A world climate conference recommends a framework treaty on climate change, calling the issue "a common concern of mankind." Negotiations on a world treaty are authorized by the UN General Assembly.
* 1992 -- A framework convention on climate change is signed by most of the world's countries in Rio de Janeiro, calling for voluntary controls on greenhouse gas emissions.
* 1995 -- A second assessment report by the IPCC surveys the state of scientific knowledge worldwide and concludes "the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate."
* 1997 -- A conference at Kyoto, Japan, produces commitments by most countries of the world, including Canada, to reduce their emissions by specific amounts by the year 2010.

Abstract: This week, after a series of quick visits to eastern Ontario communities, Premier [Mike Harris] flew off to Mexico to join the Team Canada trade mission, presumably convinced the worst was over. Quebec's [Lucien Bouchard], with Montreal's south shore still in darkness, stayed home to display the solidarity he's been urging on Quebecers. [Jean Chretien], after flying into some of the worst-hit areas of Quebec and Ontario by helicopter, was pondering whether the situation was now stable enough for him to fly south. Even as Chretien was out reassuring victims that federal pockets are open, Opposition Leader Preston Manning made a speech in Brampton urging business leaders to keep pressure on the Liberals to make debt reduction their priority. Manning presumably didn't mean to imply that the storm victims should be left to their own devices, but he's a doubter on global warming and opposed to big spending to pay for the switch to a less polluting economy. North America has always experienced peaks of destructive weather, but the latest trend looks more like a plateau - suggesting a fundamental shift toward a more extreme climate. Researchers say we're experiencing more intense El Ninos, the recurring warm air masses from the tropical oceans. According to Environment Canada, the latest El Nino produced the warm flow of air which, after hitting colder air masses over eastern Canada, caused the Montreal ice-storm.

Full text: OTTAWA With freezing temperatures now gripping eastern Ontario and Quebec communities already deprived of heat and light, the bill for Canada's worst ice storm ever is steadily mounting. Authorities calculate the cost of restoring normalcy at almost $2 billion in Quebec alone.
But the real question facing Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Mike Harris and Lucien Bouchard isn't just about paying disaster relief. It's whether the job ahead is bigger than simply restringing those snapped hydro lines.
We may just have had the warning that our climate is turning more destructive and hydro lines strung on poles and metal pylons are simply going to be too vulnerable in future. Shouldn't we be planning now to put those lines underground? Shouldn't we be providing backup systems for when the electricity is shut off again?
Scientists simply don't have enough data to tell us whether we are experiencing the first stages of climate change. But there's an eerie parallel to the extreme weather that their models forecast for us, as so-called greenhouse pollution gradually warms the Earth's atmosphere.
The worst ice storm in Canadian history may be the best warning we'll get that the need to make decisive cuts in carbon dioxide emissions is pressing. And so is protective action like underground hydro lines and flood dikes to help us weather the early turbulence of climate change. The costs of not doing so will be even more enormous.
This week, after a series of quick visits to eastern Ontario communities, Premier Harris flew off to Mexico to join the Team Canada trade mission, presumably convinced the worst was over. Quebec's Bouchard, with Montreal's south shore still in darkness, stayed home to display the solidarity he's been urging on Quebecers. Chretien, after flying into some of the worst-hit areas of Quebec and Ontario by helicopter, was pondering whether the situation was now stable enough for him to fly south.
On Monday, the PM assured Quebecers and rural Ontarians that "you are not alone." The armed forces and federal disaster relief would be there for them until normalcy was restored.
Even as Chretien was out reassuring victims that federal pockets are open, Opposition Leader Preston Manning made a speech in Brampton urging business leaders to keep pressure on the Liberals to make debt reduction their priority. Manning presumably didn't mean to imply that the storm victims should be left to their own devices, but he's a doubter on global warming and opposed to big spending to pay for the switch to a less polluting economy.
Manning's nay-saying adds to the political challenge facing Environment Minister Christine Stewart and Energy Minister Ralph Goodale, the two federal ministers charged with reducing Canada's emissions of greenhouse gases. In advance of next month's budget, they are pressing Finance Minister Paul Martin to introduce more incentives to encourage industry and individuals to switch to less polluting technologies.
Stewart's case before cabinet - and in persuading the doubters such as Manning would be much stronger if Environment Canada's scientists could say for sure that the spate of storms, floods and forest fires that have hit the country in the last couple of years are the harbingers of global warming. In the absence of such proof, neither Chretien nor any other prominent politician wants to risk ridicule, or be accused of alarmism.
Yet, the government's advisers have pulled together some very unnerving data which, if not conclusive proof of the scientific kind, certainly point to a trend.
Figures compiled by the insurance industry show a dramatic increase in global losses from weather-related disasters - from $3.4 billion for the entire 1980s to $20.2 billion for the first three years of the 1990s alone.
North America has always experienced peaks of destructive weather, but the latest trend looks more like a plateau - suggesting a fundamental shift toward a more extreme climate. Researchers say we're experiencing more intense El Ninos, the recurring warm air masses from the tropical oceans. According to Environment Canada, the latest El Nino produced the warm flow of air which, after hitting colder air masses over eastern Canada, caused the Montreal ice-storm.
Actual scientific proof of the connection between global warming and the weather extremes we're experiencing may not be available for a couple of decades. Then, our children stand to inherit conditions of which this week's storm is only a foretaste.
Two days ago, the Canada-U.S. International Joint Commission released its interim report on last spring's Red River flood, warning that "this is no time for complacency . . . the flood of 1997 or an even larger one could happen any year." The commission recommends 40 "prudent steps" to prepare for possible future floods in the Red River basin.
This isn't alarmism. It's considered advice that treating each disaster as a freak, to be mopped up afterward, is no longer enough.

Abstract: As many as 50,000 Maine businesses and homeowners are expected to file claims for ice damage from last week's storm, insurers said yesterday, and more snow and ice today could drive that number up. One insurer, Maine Mutual Fire Insurance Co. of Presque Isle, Maine, said it expects claims by its policyholders will exceed its own reserve fund, requiring it to make its own claim for catastrophic coverage it buys from reinsurance carriers. Across the Northeast, from upstate New York to easternmost Maine, the insurance industry earlier had predicted about $100 million in losses to homes, cars, stores, and other property, including perishable foods.

Full text: ¬† As many as 50,000 Maine businesses and homeowners are expected to file claims for ice damage from last week's storm, insurers said yesterday, and more snow and ice today could drive that number up.
While each claim appears to be relatively small, averaging about $1,500, together they could represent a loss of as much as $75 million shared among several dozen insurers.
One insurer, Maine Mutual Fire Insurance Co. of Presque Isle, Maine, said it expects claims by its policyholders will exceed its own reserve fund, requiring it to make its own claim for catastrophic coverage it buys from reinsurance carriers.
Insurers said claims in New Hampshire and Vermont, where damage was more isolated, were much lower than in Maine.
Across the Northeast, from upstate New York to easternmost Maine, the insurance industry earlier had predicted about $100 million in losses to homes, cars, stores, and other property, including perishable foods.
That didn't include the cost of restoring electric service, which most utilities will have to shoulder themselves; repairs to roads and other public facilities; or for flood damage, which is paid through a federal insurance program.
In Canada, where about 800,000 people still were without electricity last night, losses could exceed $1.4 billion, the Associated Press reported, including damage to farms and repairs to the Hydro Quebec electric system.
Forecasts yesterday of another storm had Maine insurers wary that losses could rise more. "The thermometer is wavering and there is a lot more that could happen if there are more freeze-ups," said George Gould, vice president for claims at Commercial Union York Insurance Co. in Portland.
That company, a subsidiary of Commercial Union Insurance Co. of Boston, is the largest casualty underwriter in Maine, with about one-eighth of all homeowner policies and a quarter of business casualty insurance.
State Farm Insurance Cos., the second-largest underwriter of home insurance in Maine, said it expects about 8,000 claims for homes and 1,000 claims for auto damage in the four states hit by the storm, with a potential payout of $11.7 million. About 5,500 claims are expected by State Farm in Maine.
Larry Shaw, president and chief executive of Maine Mutual, with 7 percent of all homeowner policies in the state, said 750 claims were filed as of yesterday. He said that number may double after property owners get out to survey their damage.
"A lot of people are still without power, or just trying to survive," Richard Sawyer, president of Acadia Insurance Co. of Westbrook, Maine, said. "The last thing they are going to think about is filing an insurance claim."
Acadia, a subsidiary of the W.R. Berkley Corp. of Stamford, Conn., is Maine's third-largest business casualty underwriter, according to the Boston-based Alliance of American Insurers.
Maine Mutual said it hired adjusters from Alabama to help assess the damage. Other larger insurers said reinforcements were coming from their offices in other states.
The Insurance Information Institute, a Washington-based lobby and public information office, said the industry as a whole should have no difficulty covering the losses. "We had $2 billion in damage from a series of snowstorms a few years ago and had no trouble dealing with that," a spokesman said.
Still, the insurance industry can't forget the $130 billion in losses caused by a barrage of floods, hurricanes, and other storms between 1990 and 1995 -- a siege of natural disasters that has caused some top insurance executives to consider a global climate change as the possible cause of such severe weather.
"The talk in the industry is that no one has ever even considered an ice storm of this magnitude," Shaw, the president of Maine Mutual, said. "When you think of this on a global basis, and the reach of this storm into Quebec and New York, the reinsurance industry is likely to see a real impact."

Abstract: [Jean Chretien]'s cabinet was almost the only part of the federal government still on the job Friday. Four days of freezing rain turned Ottawa's streets into a shambles of broken trees and downed hydro wires, causing the mayor to proclaim the capital a disaster area. Banks and federal departments told their employees to stay home and Defence Minister Art Eggleton called out the armed forces. Already, the Insurance Bureau of Canada said the costs of the ice storm will exceed even that of last May's Winnipeg flood. Henry Hengeveld, federal science adviser on climate change, said Friday: "We cannot blame the ice storm on global warming. The ice storm is caused by El Nino (the recurring current of warm air flowing from the tropical oceans). But what is causing this very unusual El Nino? The science community is very puzzled." For Canadians who had happily anticipated a warmer winter this year, the disastrous reality is coming as a shock. The massive influx of warm air from the south sliding over Ottawa and Montreal has brought repeated storms of freezing rain, instead of the snowfall that would have occurred if the temperatures had been only a couple of degrees lower. "This is the nasty side of what we can expect more often as we get into a warmer climate," Hengeveld said.

Full text: OTTAWA Climate experts are hesitating to blame the worst ice storm in recorded history on global warming. But members of Jean Chretien's federal cabinet are privately conceding that this is more than a freak of nature.
It is weather of our own making.
We've had a year of evidence. Last winter's floods in Quebec's Saguenay region, the rising of the Red River around Winnipeg in the spring, out-of-season forest fires in Alberta early this winter and now a crushing ice storm across the east of the continent. Common sense is forcing even the cabinet's doubters to admit climate patterns are changing and the so-called greenhouse effect is upon us.
At Friday's cabinet meeting, Environment Minister Christine Stewart took a ribbing from fellow ministers who told her she's going overboard to convince the public she's right that we have to change our gas-guzzling ways. "Enough already, you've made your point," one minister told her.
Chretien's cabinet was almost the only part of the federal government still on the job Friday. Four days of freezing rain turned Ottawa's streets into a shambles of broken trees and downed hydro wires, causing the mayor to proclaim the capital a disaster area. Banks and federal departments told their employees to stay home and Defence Minister Art Eggleton called out the armed forces. Already, the Insurance Bureau of Canada said the costs of the ice storm will exceed even that of last May's Winnipeg flood.
In Environment Canada's Toronto offices, federal meteorologists said there's no direct proof that this particular ice storm is the result of global warming. While scientists have built models able to measure the global effects of climate change, they don't yet have the capacity to prove the connection to specific disasters.
Climate change experts, however, have been forecasting just such a pattern of turbulent weather as greenhouse gases build in the atmosphere trapping heat at the Earth's surface.
Henry Hengeveld, federal science adviser on climate change, said Friday: "We cannot blame the ice storm on global warming. The ice storm is caused by El Nino (the recurring current of warm air flowing from the tropical oceans). But what is causing this very unusual El Nino? The science community is very puzzled."
Since meteorologists began recording weather this century, this is the largest El Nino yet. Some scientists argue that El Ninos will be bigger and warmer during the next decades of climate change as the surface temperatures of the tropical oceans rise.
"I would say the scientific community is not in consensus," Hengeveld said. "But the suggestion is that El Ninos will be more intense during global warming. And that suggestion has not been refuted."
For Canadians who had happily anticipated a warmer winter this year, the disastrous reality is coming as a shock. The massive influx of warm air from the south sliding over Ottawa and Montreal has brought repeated storms of freezing rain, instead of the snowfall that would have occurred if the temperatures had been only a couple of degrees lower. "This is the nasty side of what we can expect more often as we get into a warmer climate," Hengeveld said.
For Stewart, the question now is whether Canadians will accept the evidence before their eyes or will continue to deny what is happening.
Combatting global warming means cutting the polluting greenhouse emissions pouring from our industrial smokestacks and vehicle tailpipes. Those who are reluctant to pay for pollution control or make the shift to renewable energy sources point to the lack of hard scientific proof as an excuse for inaction.
It is this wall of indifference, or outright denial, that Stewart and Energy Minister Ralph Goodale hope to penetrate in a series of meetings with provincial ministers, municipal officials and industry groups that starts later this month.
The two federal ministers will be asking all the players to buy into Canada's target, announced in Kyoto last month, for cutting greenhouse gases by nearly 20 per cent over the next 13 years.
Like many other Ottawa homeowners, or residents of Montreal's south shore, I had a broken tree lying in my driveway this weekend, where my car and teenage son were standing only minutes before the huge limbs came crashing down. I don't need definitive scientific evidence about global warming. Anyone with eyes can see that we've already procrastinated until it's almost too late.

Abstract: [Jean Chretien]'s cabinet was almost the only part of the federal government still on the job yesterday. Four days of freezing rain turned Ottawa's streets into a shambles of broken trees and downed hydro wires, causing the mayor to proclaim the capital a disaster area. Banks and federal departments told their employees to stay home, and Defence Minister Art Eggleton called out the armed forces. Already, the Insurance Bureau of Canada said the costs of the ice storm will exceed even that of last May's Winnipeg flood. Henry Hengeveld, federal science adviser on climate change, said yesterday: "We cannot blame the ice storm on global warming. The ice storm is caused by El Nino (the recurring current of warm air flowing from the tropical oceans). But what is causing this very unusual El Nino? The science community is very puzzled." For Canadians who had happily anticipated a warmer winter this year, the disastrous reality is coming as a shock. The massive influx of warm air from the south sliding over Ottawa and Montreal has brought storms of freezing rain, instead of the snowfall that would have occurred if the temperatures had been only a couple of degrees lower. "This is the nasty side of what we can expect more often as we get into a warmer climate," Hengeveld said.

Full text: ¬† Climate experts are hesitating to blame the worst ice storm in recorded history on global warming. But members of Jean Chretien's federal cabinet are privately conceding that this is more than a freak of nature.
It is weather of our own making.
We've had a year of evidence: last winter's floods in Quebec's Saguenay region, the rising of the Red River around Winnipeg in the spring, out-of-season forest fires in Alberta early this winter, and now a crushing ice storm across the east of the continent. Common sense is forcing even the cabinet's doubters to admit climate patterns are changing and the so-called greenhouse effect is upon us.
At yesterday's cabinet meeting, Environment Minister Christine Stewart took a ribbing from fellow ministers who told her she's going overboard to convince the public she's right that we have to change our gas-guzzling ways. "Enough already, you've made your point," one minister told her.
Chretien's cabinet was almost the only part of the federal government still on the job yesterday. Four days of freezing rain turned Ottawa's streets into a shambles of broken trees and downed hydro wires, causing the mayor to proclaim the capital a disaster area. Banks and federal departments told their employees to stay home, and Defence Minister Art Eggleton called out the armed forces. Already, the Insurance Bureau of Canada said the costs of the ice storm will exceed even that of last May's Winnipeg flood.
In Environment Canada's Toronto offices, federal meteorologists said there's no direct proof that this particular ice storm is the result of global warming. While scientists have built models able to measure the global effects of climate change, they don't yet have the capacity to prove the connection to specific disasters.
Climate-change experts, however, have been forecasting just such a pattern of turbulent weather as greenhouse gases build in the atmosphere, trapping heat at the Earth's surface.
Henry Hengeveld, federal science adviser on climate change, said yesterday: "We cannot blame the ice storm on global warming. The ice storm is caused by El Nino (the recurring current of warm air flowing from the tropical oceans). But what is causing this very unusual El Nino? The science community is very puzzled."
Since meteorologists began recording weather this century, this is the largest El Nino yet. Some scientists argue that El Ninos will be bigger and warmer during the next decades of climate change as the surface temperatures of the tropical oceans rise.
"I would say the scientific community is not in consensus," Hengeveld said. "But the suggestion is that El Ninos will be more intense during global warming, and that suggestion has not been refuted."
For Canadians who had happily anticipated a warmer winter this year, the disastrous reality is coming as a shock. The massive influx of warm air from the south sliding over Ottawa and Montreal has brought storms of freezing rain, instead of the snowfall that would have occurred if the temperatures had been only a couple of degrees lower. "This is the nasty side of what we can expect more often as we get into a warmer climate," Hengeveld said.
For Stewart, the question now is whether Canadians will accept the evidence before their eyes, or will continue to deny what is happening.
Combatting global warming means cutting the polluting greenhouse emissions pouring from our industrial smokestacks and vehicle tailpipes. Those who are reluctant to pay for pollution control, or make the shift to renewable energy sources point to the lack of hard scientific proof as an excuse for inaction.
It is this wall of indifference, or outright denial, that Stewart and Energy Minister Ralph Goodale hope to penetrate in a series of meetings with provincial ministers, municipal officials and industry groups that starts this month. The two federal ministers will be asking all the players to buy into Canada's target, announced in Kyoto last month, for cutting greenhouse gases by nearly 20 per cent over the next 13 years.
Like many Ottawa homeowners, or residents of Montreal's South Shore, I've got a broken tree lying in my driveway, where my car and teenage son were standing only minutes before the huge limbs came crashing down. I don't need definitive scientific evidence about global warming.
Anyone with eyes can see that we've already procrastinated until it's almost too late.

Man's greed fuels global bonfire: [Main/Lifestyle, , 2* Edition]

Author: Paul Brown Note: (STF) - The breakdown of the rule of law has helped make 1997 the worst ever year for sending forests all over the world up in smoke. Paul Brown reports.

Abstract: FOREST fires deliberately lit by man in many parts of the world have made 1997 the worst year in recorded history for destruction of the natural environment, a report released recently says. The biggest and most numerous fires were in Brazil, where they raged along a 16,000km front, and still burn. Second came Indonesia, where months of haze put 40,000 people in hospital. But Papua New Guinea, Colombia, Africa, Australia and southern Europe have had large areas devastated, too. Greece, Spain, Italy and France have all suffered, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report, entitled The Year the Earth Caught Fire.

Full text: FOREST fires deliberately lit by man in many parts of the world have made 1997 the worst year in recorded history for destruction of the natural environment, a report released recently says.
The biggest and most numerous fires were in Brazil, where they raged along a 16,000km front, and still burn. Second came Indonesia, where months of haze put 40,000 people in hospital.
But Papua New Guinea, Colombia, Africa, Australia and southern Europe have had large areas devastated, too. Greece, Spain, Italy and France have all suffered, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report, entitled The Year the Earth Caught Fire.
Although the droughts in the Amazon and Southeast Asia caused by the change in monsoon patterns brought about by the strong El Nino in the Pacific are partially to blame, human greed is the main cause.
The breakdown of law and order in many countries has escalated the destruction.
Although some countries, including Indonesia, claim that lighting fires is banned, much of the damage there is on government-funded projects.
Forest fires have always been a hazard of lightning during hot periods or drought, and in some cases they help the environment by creating clearings and healthy regeneration, the reports says.
But the risks are increased by human activities such as selective logging, drainage and pollution-related climate change.
Most accidental fires result from losing control over fires started for land clearance, charcoal burning and cooking. Some begin from transport and dropped cigarettes.
But this year the main causes have been land clearance for farms or plantations, timber speculation, insurance crime and even vandalism.
"The widespread breakdown of the rule of law is a critical factor in fire abuse," the report says.
The data are backed by satellite information analysed by the Woods Hole Institute in the United States and Edinburgh University.
Researchers all agree that the destruction is continuing. Some peat fires in Indonesia are expected to burn for years. Although damped down by rains, they are likely to break out again in the dry season.
Claude Martin, director-general of WWF said: "These fires were not an act of God. They were deliberately set, as they have been for many years, to clear forests for other purposes, and sometimes to cover up for timber poaching and land theft.
"It is also increasingly clear that the guilty parties are not just small farmers, as has been assumed, but most of the damage is being done by plantation and timber companies. This is not just an emergency, it is a planetary disaster."
Barita Manullane, from Indonesia, where two million hectares of forest have been lost this year, said government-sponsored rice-growing projects were chiefly to blame.
He is in charge of a project to save the Orang Utan and said the swamp forests where they survive, were being drained and deliberately burned, even though it was in his view impossible to grow rice there.
"The peat has now caught fire and despite the rains coming, burns on. I cannot see how they can ever put them out. Many of the animals are dead or driven from the trees by the haze."
Fires in Brazil have increased by 50 per cent compared to last year. Loggers, cattle farmers and peasants have taken advantage of the dry season to clear land. An average 599 new fires a day were reported, making 24,549 fires in a period of 41 days.
In Brazil's Atlantic rain forest one of the rarest mammals in the world, the golden lion tamarind, is threatened by deliberate burning.
In Colombia there have been 7,000 forest fires, including 37 in protected areas, and 16,000ha of national parks have been burnt.
Papua New Guinea is suffering its worst drought of 50 years and speculators have burned thousands of square kilometres of forest and grassland, leaving millions on the edge of starvation.
An international relief effort is under way but loss of vegetation is expected to affect the climate.
Most recently, Australia has suffered forest and scrub fires, which have penetrated the suburbs of Sydney.
Kenya's famous Imenti Forest around Mount Kenya has been burned by illegal settlers as bribed forest officials turn a blind eye.
Tanzania, Senegal and the Congo have had large forest fires.
Rwanda's relic cloud forest was threatened in the Nyungve Montane Forest Reserve, where several square kilometres were left burning for weeks with no attempt to put them out.
Michael Tene, an attache at the Indonesian embassy in London, said: "We regret the fires which we are trying to stop, but we do not have the means.
"We are not a stupid people. We want the forests but at the same time we have to feed 200 million people and so we need rice, too."

Full text: MORE tornadoes will hit Britain as global warming takes hold, scientists and insurance chiefs believe. And the "twister" that tore apart the seaside town of Selsey, West Sussex, on Wednesday night is likely to make insurance more expensive.
But Britain was not the only country to experience extreme weather last week. In Canada, the country's worst ice storm on record has wreaked havoc across five eastern provinces - shutting down airports and trains and cutting power to 3 million people - 40 per cent of the population - in Quebec.
Hundreds of Montreal residents abandoned their homes to take shelter in community centres and schools with generators. The government deployed more than 4,000 soldiers to help with relief efforts.
At least 10 deaths in Canada were blamed on the storm, and more freezing rain on Friday spread misery from the Canadian capital, Ottawa, in eastern Ontario, across southern Quebec to the Atlantic provinces.
Back in Britain, scientists warned that the tornado that hit Selsey was caused by unusually warm seas in the English channel and an intense thunder storm. Both factors are expected to become more common due to the man-made climatic change that scientists believe is under way.
The official inter-governmental panel on climate change predicts that seas will get warmer and the weather stormier world-wide as the world heats up.
Dr Terence Meaden, founder of the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation, said winter tornadoes tended to start over the sea, which is warmer than land, and that Britain, as an island, was particularly vulnerable.
Insurers are also waking up to the possibility of increased tornado- related pay-outs. Andrew Dlugolcki of General Accident said last week's tornado would be likely to affectpremiums even though the amount of damage - pounds 10m - was tiny by the standards of natural disasters.
Residents in Selsey have been warned about cowboy builders.Several incidents where people have handed over large sums of money for relatively small repairs are being investigated by police.
But Britain has not finished with weather extremes - this weekend appears to have provided a taste of spring, with warm sunshine under blue skies. Forecasters called it "a rare treat".

Abstract: I wonder why the Dayton Daily News Editorial Board does not understand that men will do almost anything to restore their hair (`Male nightmare question arises,' Dec. 29). Granted, it seems like a big gamble to risk one's virility in exchange for a head full of hair. But sometimes appearance is more important than reality - just ask the women who are willing to risk their health with breast implants. Or ask the doctors who perform cosmetic procedures and the makers of cosmetics, false nails and eyelashes, breast forms and hosiery. We are a society obsessed with appearance. Of course, I've had women tell me baldness is no big deal; I've overheard some of these same women critique the appearance of other men. I've seen surveys that indicate that a sizable minority of women is not concerned with a man's hairline; these surveys also showed that a sizable majority of female respondents is not attracted to a balding pate. Truth be told: Short, fat and bald are the worst things to be.

I wonder why the Dayton Daily News Editorial Board does not understand that men will do almost anything to restore their hair (`Male nightmare question arises,' Dec. 29). Granted, it seems like a big gamble to risk one's virility in exchange for a head full of hair.
But sometimes appearance is more important than reality - just ask the women who are willing to risk their health with breast implants. Or ask the doctors who perform cosmetic procedures and the makers of cosmetics, false nails and eyelashes, breast forms and hosiery. We are a society obsessed with appearance.
Of course, I've had women tell me baldness is no big deal; I've overheard some of these same women critique the appearance of other men. I've seen surveys that indicate that a sizable minority of women is not concerned with a man's hairline; these surveys also showed that a sizable majority of female respondents is not attracted to a balding pate. Truth be told: Short, fat and bald are the worst things to be.
I would agree that science has had little to offer balding men. We are still at the `snake oil' stage of remedies, with no permanent, safe and affordable solution yet offered.
My suggestion is that cloning techniques be utilized to reproduce unlimited supplies of hair plugs and that the procedure to implant them become as commonplace - and affordable - as a trip to the dentist.
Robert P. Troxell Centerville
Dayton must take bold steps
to restore city's liveability
The Jan. 6 editorial `City's posture on baseball begs question' was, unfortunately, right on target. The editorial writer's foresight was depressing but all too true.
Dayton is dying fast and has become a very undesirable place to live in. We have falling property values and poor basic services - in particular, law enforcement and code enforcement. We have horrible schools, and there's nothing but hope on the horizon.
The city can live again. It will take a few bold and very unpopular moves. Let's start with some very aggressive policing. The city streets are a great place to start, since there's no traffic enforcement. There's a ton of money waiting to be collected. The booming auto stereos also would be a good source of revenue. Let's not forget how much all the impounded cars would bring if we had someone enforcing the state insurance laws.
I have never lived in a city where the police presence on the streets is so nonexistent. People can walk the streets at three in the morning or three in the afternoon with their 40-ouncers and go unchecked. We need beat cops who have the `Not on my beat attitude' and a political system that will support them.
If we are going to save Dayton, we have to clean up the streets. I'm not referring to litter, either. For revenues downtown, open an area designated as a `Combat Zone.' Here would be the strip clubs and other controversial forms of entertainment. Then we would have revenues downtown, and many of the undesirables who drag down our neighborhoods would have a place to congregate and sell their wares. The majority of the problems would be in a concentrated area. That would cut down on the manpower requirements for vice squads and allow the aggressive posture around the rest of the city that it needs.
To get this city liveable again, it's going to take guts and a `show-me-the-money' attitude.
Citizens are ready to live with controversial and unpopular moves if it means the neighborhoods and main thoroughfares would be safe again. ...

Scientists in `irrelevant' fields
know plenty about climate
I must question Rowland Nethaway's use of a report by a Washington business group, the Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation, to attack the credentials of thousands of scientists who recently expressed their concern over global climatic disruption (`U.S. should base its position on facts rather than dogma,' Dec. 15).
The CSE report judged that only scientists in a handful of fields can legitimately be considered experts on climate change. Almost 100 disciplines, including ecology, forestry, botany and biology, were ruled out as irrelevant. Yet it is researchers in precisely these areas who are most aware of the wide-ranging, day-to-day impacts of climate change. ...
The scientists' statement represents the most significant political statement by a highly qualified and diverse group of scientists since the groundswell of opposition from the scientific community to the nuclear threat. It demonstrates consensus among diverse interests and makes clear that climate change affects untold aspects of our lives.
It is the height of irony that CSE should even write about the climate-change debate going on within the science community. CSE is funded by a long list of fossil-fuel companies. Many of these companies have underwritten the handful of skeptics in the scientific field who, working largely outside the peer-reviewed literature, have attempted to reposition global warming as a theoretical phenomenon rather than fact.

Nature snaps its fingers: Ice storm brings us together - and reminds us who's boss: [Final Edition]

Abstract: It had been a Manitoba maple, tall and slender. When it crashed, its trunk destroyed a birdfeeder on the ground with the casual ease of a man crumpling a ball of paper. I stepped gingerly outside, and heard a similar fall on the next block. A snap, a dull thud: all of a sudden, these were noises to dread. It wasn't always so. When Europeans first came to North America, some of them saw the ability to survive the bitter winters as proof of moral superiority over the mild, decadent Old World.

The forest fires that ravaged Indonesia last year left the impression that the tropics are burning up. The oceans have fewer and fewer fish in them; many scientists now class cod as an endangered species. Five hundred years ago, when John Cabot's sailors landed on the shores of what they called "New Founde Lande," the cod were so abundant that men could dip a basket in the sea and haul it in, brimming with life.

Full text: ¬† When it happened, I was looking out the kitchen window, wondering plaintively how many hours would pass before I could boil a kettle or heat some hot chocolate for my daughters. The house was cooling fast, and the yard was already strewn with branches. A crisp, snapping sound drew my gaze just in time for me to watch a tree breaking like a toothpick.
It had been a Manitoba maple, tall and slender. When it crashed, its trunk destroyed a birdfeeder on the ground with the casual ease of a man crumpling a ball of paper. I stepped gingerly outside, and heard a similar fall on the next block. A snap, a dull thud: all of a sudden, these were noises to dread.
It wasn't just the next block, of course. All over the city, the island, the whole region, ice had assumed power. Whatever our age or language, whatever our religion or income level, we'd been taken captive by a force greater than ourselves.
The experience stirs old memories, old talents. In a crisis like this, we recall how to improvise heat, how to conserve priceless warmth. One of my neighbours fried bacon and eggs yesterday morning by setting up a propane stove on his driveway. People find ways of making do; the healthy ones, at least.
And, like most kinds of crises, this one has the power to bring its victims together.
We tell stories to each other, as though the mere exchange of yarns and schemes would make winter a milder jailer. Usually, I'm not a fan of open-line radio; but in the past couple of days, I've become an avid listener.
If you listen, you pick up knowledge; when you're in the know, you gain a sort of power. Among the most isolated - and therefore, the most powerless - are those people who not only lack heat and light, but also lack a radio with batteries.
Still, no amount of information can turn the Hydro crews into magicians. Like it or not, they have become our escape masters. Their work alone can liberate us from the captivity of cold and darkness.
The crisis has stirred another old, almost atavistic sense: a respect for the sheer dominance of nature. As a rule, we neglect this awareness. Between November and April, daily life in all of Quebec and most of Canada depends on the capacity to hold nature at bay.
We pretend to have conquered nature. Most of the time, nature plays along, jabbing us occasionally in the ribs. You could even say that Montreal, like every other city in a harsh climate, is built on a foundation of denial.
It wasn't always so. When Europeans first came to North America, some of them saw the ability to survive the bitter winters as proof of moral superiority over the mild, decadent Old World. Snowy winters in the 19th century - just think of the lush whiteness of a Krieghoff painting - were viewed as emblems of beauty and renewal.
Not any more. As early as World War II, an American company was advertising its snowplows with the slogan "Snow - Friend of the Enemy." In this decade, the city of Montreal has spent tens of thousands of dollars to promote our city as an underground haven: somewhere you could escape winter without the help of Dorval airport.
If the fallen power lines had a voice, they might be saying: "Dream on." It may be, indeed, that when we finally lurch past the millennium, we'll realize that one of the defining qualities of the 1990s has been the escalating war between nature and humankind.
In many ways, nature has been losing. The forest fires that ravaged Indonesia last year left the impression that the tropics are burning up. The oceans have fewer and fewer fish in them; many scientists now class cod as an endangered species. Five hundred years ago, when John Cabot's sailors landed on the shores of what they called "New Founde Lande," the cod were so abundant that men could dip a basket in the sea and haul it in, brimming with life.
But nature still has its weapons. Just ask the residents of the Saguenay, where the sudden flood of July 1996 killed 10 people and caused roughly $800 million in damages. In a mere two days, the volume of rain that fell on the area was equivalent to the water that pours over Niagara Falls in a month.
Or ask the people who live near the Red River in southern Manitoba. Last spring, 28,000 of them had to flee their homes. The flood created a freshwater sea in which the false-fronted prairie towns became fortified islands.
Around the world, it seems, severe floods are becoming common enough that language fights to keep up. The people of the Netherlands suffered a "flood of the century" in 1993. Two years later, they had another one.
Forget day-to-day politics - and isn't that a relief? Yet beyond all the soundbites and question periods of the year gone and the year to come, many of the key issues facing Canadians are issues about our relationship to nature: questions about energy use, toxic waste, forest conservation, climate change and so on.
Perhaps it's too much of a stretch to relate this week's conquest by ice to that alarming list. Perhaps our present struggles are indeed a mere freak of nature. After all, if the ice had the power to overturn a clutch of steel pylons that carry 735,000 volts of electricity, it's no wonder it also had the power to destroy the maple tree in my back yard.
I'm not so sure. After the last big ice storm in 1983, Montrealers discovered that thousands of the mangled trees had already been weakened by acid rain. It would have been a good lesson to remember; but probably it was human nature to forget the lesson until now.
The effect of the rainfall on the Saguenay, we eventually found out, was worsened by clear-cutting of the forests and dam-building along the waterways. Likewise, the impact of the Red River flood was heightened by the destruction of natural wetlands.
It's not just the David Suzukis of this world who sometimes sound alarmist. It was, bear in mind, the giant Swiss Re insurance company that issued a report in 1994 warning that "Climate will not just change in future; it is doing so today.
"The danger of unmanageable extreme weather situations is therefore not a future threat but already an acute one."
Tell us about it.
Nature, in short, is under constant siege. But when nature snaps back, watch out. Montreal may be finding now - just as Chicoutimi did in 1996 and Winnipeg in 1997 - that our onslaught on the natural world in the end makes things worse for ourselves.

What climate change means to you: Businesses and individuals will have to change for Canada to meet its commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions. But there are gains from these sacrifices.: [Final Edition]

Author: Isaacs, Colin

Abstract: Some in industry are concerned that governments will force them to spend money to address the climate change issue, but many industry leaders are already taking climate change into account in their business decisions. The insurance industry is raising rates to cover anticipated weather-related damage. The natural gas companies are telling us that we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 10 per cent by switching from oil to natural gas. Some oil companies, such as BP, Shell, and Sunoco, are investing heavily in alternative energy projects that can meet society's needs for heat, warmth, and transportation with far less impact on the atmosphere than conventional energy sources. The automobile industry is investing heavily in alternate fuels and more fuel efficient vehicles. For most of the past 10,000 years, the CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentration in the atmosphere remained stable at about 280 parts per million (ppm). Since the industrial revolution, however, the concentration of CO2 has increased 30 per cent and, today, stands at 364 ppm. Conservative estimates for the year 2100 suggest the CO2 concentration will approach 500 ppm, or nearly double that of the pre-industrial era. In addition, it is known that the concentrations of the other major greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous oxide, are also on the rise. The IPCC was given the mandate to assess, on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis, the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the risk of human-induced climate change. Worldwide, it is the IPCC assessment of climate change science that stands as the "scientific consensus."

Full text: Note
The agreement reached at the international conference in Kyoto last month marked a turning point in world attitudes towards climate change. While there is still uncertainty about precise impacts, world leaders in science, government, and industry now agree that human activity is changing the climate. The challenge of the next 15 years will be to incorporate that reality into our everyday decisions.
Some industry groups have tried to argue that climate change is a myth. The world scientific community is now generally agreed that human activities are contributing increased levels of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and that this will have an impact on the climate.
It is true that some scientists still disagree, but there are very few issues about which scientists are unanimous. Science is a process of discovery and debate. It is not a process that provides instant facts. Even Einstein's Theory of Relativity is still unproven, though we use it everyday as the basis for launching satellites and planning major energy industry initiatives.
Global warming, climate change, and the greenhouse effect are three terms that have been used almost interchangeably. The term global warming is somewhat misleading.
Increased levels of greenhouse gases will trap more of the sun's energy on the surface of the earth, but that does not mean that every place gets warmer. Climate is the result of a complex interaction of the atmosphere with the oceans and the continents, mountains and valleys, and the temperature effects of day and night. Global warming will not occur uniformly. Some places will become warmer, others will become cooler.
IMPACT
Ontario will still experience extended periods of intense cold. Weather patterns will become less predictable and more violent. In Ontario, the average level of the Great Lakes is likely to fall, necessitating expensive dredging for shipping and perhaps reducing hydroelectric generating capacity. (An Environment Canada report suggests warming could cause a rise in sea level because of melting of ice and the general expansion of ocean volume due to higher temperature, while Great Lakes levels will decline due to increased evaporation counteracting increased precipitation.)
Summers will become warmer, with longer heat waves and an increase in episodes of unhealthy air pollution. The forests in cottage country will suffer from heat stress and forest fires will become more frequent. Violent storms may become more frequent in our area.
Some in industry are concerned that governments will force them to spend money to address the climate change issue, but many industry leaders are already taking climate change into account in their business decisions. The insurance industry is raising rates to cover anticipated weather-related damage. The natural gas companies are telling us that we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 10 per cent by switching from oil to natural gas. Some oil companies, such as BP, Shell, and Sunoco, are investing heavily in alternative energy projects that can meet society's needs for heat, warmth, and transportation with far less impact on the atmosphere than conventional energy sources. The automobile industry is investing heavily in alternate fuels and more fuel efficient vehicles.
Interestingly, the North American petroleum industry, sometimes a critic of the Kyoto negotiations, may be among the biggest losers if climate change is allowed to take hold. About 10 per cent of Canadian oil is used for home heating. If winters become warmer, we will be buying less heating oil. In the north there is already evidence that the tundra is melting and heavy equipment used by oil companies is becoming mired in the mud. More violent storms in the North Atlantic could threaten the offshore oil rigs with dramatically increased costs.
Change does not come just from the Kyoto agreement. Change happens all the time. Fifteen years ago we did not have home computers or compact disks. Who knows what new technologies we will have by 2012? Business makes investment decisions every day, taking into account a wide range of factors to maximize the return to investors. Climate change will become one of the factors considered when planning new initiatives. Those who plan well will succeed. Those who plan badly will see their companies fail, just as happens today.
Steel companies are already moving away from basic steel plate to specialty steels that provide higher performance but use less material. Packaging is being reduced from big clumsy boxes to sleek pouches and lightweight plastic materials. These are the very trends that will help us deal with the climate change problem. The concept of value-added--taking a current product and making it better, or developing a new product that is more exciting and can be sold for a higher price--is already an entrenched business concept.
Doing more with less will become not just a government slogan but a watchword for the entire economy. Both Japan and Europe are already working to make their economies much more energy efficient. By doing so they will reduce the costs of production and make their goods and services much more competitive in world markets.
Climate change is not just about industry. If we ignore the problem, we leave the next generation with an inheritance that will be bad for health and lifestyle. Climate change is an environmental deficit, not unlike the economic deficit that voters have told governments to address. If we are to avoid the environmental deficit, lifestyle changes will be essential, but change does not mean turning the clock back.
Our homes will become more energy efficient, using low energy lighting and low flow appliances such as showers and washing machines that are already common in many parts of the world. Our cars will use less fuel and we'll have transit services that can really get us to work and school. Furniture and appliances will become repairable, upgradeable, and recyclable at the end of their useful lives. We may have a little less stuff but that does not mean that we will have less fun: Recreation, organized sport, education, culture, art, and theatre are among the many activities that can have much less impact on the atmosphere than motorized vehicles and piles of material possessions.
Meeting the Kyoto targets will not be easy. Many scientists believe that before we get too far into the next century we will realize that we have to achieve much more than the Kyoto targets if we are to avoid leaving a real environmental disaster for our children. There is no silver bullet, no quick easy step that will solve the problem overnight. Instead, as the figures in the box at left show, every sector of the economy has something to contribute.
For the climate change problem, the costs of inaction are far greater for Canada than the costs of action. The sooner we start planning to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the lower will be the cost and the greater the economic and employment opportunities that we can create.

KYOTO AGREEMENT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS
At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, 36 countries including Canada entered into a voluntary agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000.
Today, it is clear that the majority of these countries will fall short of this objective. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat has reported that, among developed nations, the United States, Japan and Canada are responsible for 85 per cent of the increase in CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions between 1990 and 1995 (United States, 56 per cent; Japan, 21 per cent; Canada, 8 per cent). Based on the relative size of the economies and populations of the United States and Japan, Canada's record is poor.
Projections indicate that despite our efforts since then to reduce emissions, without additional climate change initiatives, Canadian emissions in the year 2000 may still range from 8 per to 13 per cent higher than in 1990.
In Kyoto in early December, agreement was reached on legally binding timetables and targets in which Canada agreed to work toward cutting six greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent by 2012. These aren't cuts from today's levels but from baseline measurements in 1990 for three of the gases and either 1990 or 1995 for three others.

WHAT SCIENTISTS SAY
For most of the past 10,000 years, the CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentration in the atmosphere remained stable at about 280 parts per million (ppm). Since the industrial revolution, however, the concentration of CO2 has increased 30 per cent and, today, stands at 364 ppm. Conservative estimates for the year 2100 suggest the CO2 concentration will approach 500 ppm, or nearly double that of the pre-industrial era. In addition, it is known that the concentrations of the other major greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous oxide, are also on the rise.
These facts, coupled with the observation that global mean surface air temperature had increased 0.3 degrees to 0.6 degreesC over the past 100 years, alerted climatologists and, in turn, policy- makers, to the potential for significant warming of the earth's atmosphere over the next century, a phenomenon which could produce many possible negative consequences.
Around the world, this concern resulted in increased funding and the rapid expansion of climate change research. In particular, it was considered essential to determine whether human activity had been a factor in the increase in greenhouse gases, and thus has contributed to the global warming trend. In 1988, under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created.
The IPCC conducts an open-ended process where both the number of participants and the number of participating countries vary. The IPCC process is open to all member countries of the United Nations, and from time to time more than 120 nations have taken part. A mix of approximately 2,500 scientists, economists and other specialists have been engaged in the IPCC process--either in the submission of papers to the IPCC or in the review of these documents.
The IPCC was given the mandate to assess, on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis, the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the risk of human-induced climate change. Worldwide, it is the IPCC assessment of climate change science that stands as the "scientific consensus."
In 1995, the IPCC stated that "the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate."

Abstract: Severe storms which have buffeted western and northern parts of the UK since Christmas have caused tens of millions of pounds in structural damage to houses and commercial property. Heavy rain and winds gusting at more than 100mph lashed south-west England on Sunday, toppling trees and flooding roads, as another major storm moved north-east across England from Devon and Cornwall. Part of the sea wall at Westward Ho! in north Devon was demolished, and in northern France motorists and pedestrians were banned from coastal areas.

Full text: Severe storms which have buffeted western and northern parts of the UK since Christmas have caused tens of millions of pounds in structural damage to houses and commercial property.
Heavy rain and winds gusting at more than 100mph lashed south-west England on Sunday, toppling trees and flooding roads, as another major storm moved north-east across England from Devon and Cornwall.
In the Channel, huge waves swamped a drifting Spanish trawler and ripped panels from the bow section of a Stena Line s ferry. Many sailings were cancelled.
Part of the sea wall at Westward Ho! in north Devon was demolished, and in northern France motorists and pedestrians were banned from coastal areas.
The cost of most structural damage will be borne by the insurance industry. Loss assessors acting for policyholders predicted yesterday claims could total nearly ¬£100m.
Royal & Sun Alliance , the country's biggest household insurer, said it had received thousands of telephone calls reporting structural damage, but it was too early to quantify the cost. Guardian Royal Exchange said it was handling five times the normal volume of calls.
"Tiles have blown off roofs, houses have suffered flooding, and trees have fallen on cars," said AA Insurance . "It's been exceptionally busy."
Andrew Dlugolecki, assistant general manager at General Accident , the Perth-based insurer, blamed global warming for an increase in the frequency and severity of windstorms and flooding.
"Over the last 10 to 15 years, we've seen a tremendous amount of damage from storms. They are the most costly events in the UK," he said.
Statistical records compiled for the past 300 years show that strong gales are more common during mild winters. But a report last week by Munich Re , the world's biggest reinsurer, said the number of storms worldwide had risen threefold since the 1960s.
"That extreme atmospheric events accounted for such a large proportion of the losses is evidence of climate change," the report said.
The latest storms will not cost insurers as much as the hurricane which struck southern England in October 1987, when they paid out almost ¬£1bn in claims. That storm was thought to be a one-in-200-year event until another very destructive storm struck in 1990.
The Meteorological Office forecast more winds across the south today, but not as strong. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: It is time for the United States to rethink its strategy toward Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Presently, the United States is talking tough and posturing itself militarily in the Persian Gulf, but how realistic is the challenge posed by our forces? We can threaten air strikes, but at this stage in history, who is really impressed by this sort of saber-rattling? The Pentgon admits that the chances of actually destroying any of Saddam's chemical or biological weapons in a bombing raid are remote. (Nuclear bombs would do the trick, but their use is politically unthinkable.) A ground invasion and occupation force would be needed to neutralize Iraq, but China, Russia, France and other Arab states oppose military intervention. It would be unwise to act unilaterally so long as Saddam merely hordes his weapons of mass destruction. Unless he actually uses them, we cannot strike without U.N. approval. Without question, this bridge will mainly benefit one concentrated group of people living in one county. Therefore, I would propose that St. Charles County pay for all costs of building the bridge, including the approaches. Also, the state Highway Department should pay for all costs of acquiring land and building a highway to the bridge in both St. Louis and St. Charles counties.

Full text: Tough talk, sanctions aren't working in Iraq
It is time for the United States to rethink its strategy toward Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Presently, the United States is talking tough and posturing itself militarily in the Persian Gulf, but how realistic is the challenge posed by our forces? We can threaten air strikes, but at this stage in history, who is really impressed by this sort of saber-rattling?
The Pentgon admits that the chances of actually destroying any of Saddam's chemical or biological weapons in a bombing raid are remote. (Nuclear bombs would do the trick, but their use is politically unthinkable.) A ground invasion and occupation force would be needed to neutralize Iraq, but China, Russia, France and other Arab states oppose military intervention. It would be unwise to act unilaterally so long as Saddam merely hordes his weapons of mass destruction. Unless he actually uses them, we cannot strike without U.N. approval.
And what is the purpose of continuing the sanctions against Iraq? Years of deprivation have failed to turn the people against Saddam. His iron rule seems as strong as ever, and though Iraq may be a pariah state, he remains recalcitrant.
We should try lifting the sanctions allowing much needed supplies of food and medicines to be imported. This could mollify the Iraqis and give them more sanguine feelings for America. Healthy and well-fed, they might be disposed to become more independent of Saddam.
The stick has led only to stalemate, so why not try the carrot? Give Iraq the benefit of the doubt.
In any case we must not be misled by hubris into pursuing a futile and profitless military operation.

Page Avenue solutions
I am not concerned about the Page Avenue extension running through Creve Coeur Park, but I am concerned about the funds this one project will consume for the next several years. This, when there are so many other needed projects in this area.
Without question, this bridge will mainly benefit one concentrated group of people living in one county. Therefore, I would propose that St. Charles County pay for all costs of building the bridge, including the approaches. Also, the state Highway Department should pay for all costs of acquiring land and building a highway to the bridge in both St. Louis and St. Charles counties.
Since St. Charles County would be paying for the bridge it could have a choice:
(1) Start at scratch, hire a new engineering firm to design the bridge, and handle everything in connection with a new bridge.
(2) Or it could let the state continue with its design and construction, but then reimburse the state for all costs of construction of the bridge, including all costs incurred to date for surveys, design, etc. Also during construction the only cost for administration would be the cost of operating a field or job office, and the salaries of the personnel assigned to it. All cost already incurred would be prorated over the life of the job. Also, payments would be due on a monthly basis because that is the way the state pays its contractors.
I believe this would be a fair solution to all concerned citizens living in the area.

Man of principle
Jerry Berger's Dec. 16 column categorized Town & Country's mayor, John Marx, as "combative." I've worked with John in several capacities, in and out of city government, for several years. "Combative" is not a term that I would use to describe his approach to municipal government.
John is a man of principle, conviction and faith. He genuinely wants to do what is right, which sometimes causes political opponents who have sacred cows that they are trying to protect to run for cover and to sling rocks and accusations that are half-truths at best. I call for civility, for all of Town & Country's aldermen to work with the mayor, for progress.
Thomas N. Tener
Town & Country
Teen rights
I read with interest the Nov. 28 article, "Seniors get `Sting 101' lesson as incognito officer joins class." It's about an Edwardsville police officer who posed as a high school student for a few weeks to investigate possible drug problems inside the school.
The school's superintendent, Tom Bradley, apparently has been pushing for this since last year, in addition to already using drug-sniffing dogs and being allowed to search students' cars. Despite the investigation's concluding that there isn't a drug problem inside the school, Bradley seems intent on continuing these tactics.
This police officer was allowed to investigate anyone he wanted to, and he was going into their parents' homes without the parents' knowledge. He justified this by saying, "If you're not doing anything wrong, then you have nothing to worry about."
The article states that some of the students felt violated but neglected to look at the ramifications of these actions. How can we expect students to grow up and be productive members of a democracy when we don't treat them like valued citizens?
There is pending legislation to give teens urine tests prior to allowing them to drive (potential Fourth Amendment violation), their newspapers are censored (First Amendment violation), their lockers, cars, belongings and persons are all searched, possibly without just cause.
These students are not learning how to demonstrate a healthy skepticism of authority. If we neglect the freedoms we have, fascists like Bradley a nd Officer Dave Matevey will continue to sacrifice our freedoms for security.

Confused verdict
Convicting Terry Nichols of one count of conspiracy and eight counts of involuntary manslaughter seems to present an oxymoronic dilemma.
While conspiracy denotes a deliberate intent, involuntary manslaughter is the result of recklessness or accidental death. It appears that jurors, in their hurried attempts to reach a compromise verdict, were so confused that they outsmarted themselves.

Universal care
Candidate Steve Miloscia (3rd Congressional District) seems to forget when he submitted his Dec. 23 letter that the old bogeyman "socialized medicine" is no longer the scare phrase used in opposition to universal health-care insurance.
Not that Rep. Richard Gephardt has shown real concern about the more than 700,000 uninsured in Missouri and the more than 80,000 in his own district, but the day is over when "socialized medicine" is used to put fear in people. Better informed voters now know that universal health insurance is a simple non-profit way of cutting out seven-figure salaries for the private HMO CEOs, dividends for stockholders and getting an administrative cost of less than 3 percent compared to the 11 percent to 30 percent of for-profit HMOs.
If Miloscia wishes to support the for-profit, high-cost conglomerates, he might consider a more factual method to convince Gephardt that he, too, should acknowledge that "Medicare for all" regardless of age is a simple universal and cost-saving plan.
Unfortunately, some Democrats of the "new order" forgot their platform of 1992 calling for universal health insurance and changed to "access" in 1996. The later platform spent 70 percent of its verbage telling how great the party was and very little in sound platform issues.

Clinton's big ideas
The Dec. 11 editorial, "Milkman's son in Camelot," said: "Perhaps, the Gephardt speech can also provide an intellectual challenge to Mr. Clinton that could awaken the president from his fixation with small ideas."
The best economy in a generation, lowest unemployment rate in 24 years, the largest expansion of educational opportunity, the best moral leadership on the problem of race since Camelot, the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and now the climate change treaty. Such presidential leadership does not indicate a "fixation with small ideas."

Matthews, 1986), for the last of which, with Michael Bawtree, Orr won the 1988 Seagrams Prize of the America National Music Theatre Network, during his stay as composer-in-residence at the Banff Centre for Fine Arts in Alberta, Canada.
There are six song-cycles for voice and piano or instrumental ensemble, as well: The Knight and the Lady (1978) for solo voice, and The Echoing Green (1961), after William Blake, for children's voices and piano or orchestra.
His orchestral works likewise show his concern for his audience. In compositions intended for serious listeners, such as the 40-minute Sinfonia Ricercante of 1987, Orr deployed his considerable technique to produce music that would satisfy the most demanding intellect.
Yet in others, like the Triptych (1977), the Fanfare and Processional for strings (1968) or the Carmen Fantasy for cello and orchestra (1987), his sense of humour guaranteed works of immediate appeal. (In fact, A Carmen Fantasy began life as the first of a series of four operatic fantasies for cello and piano; the others are Portrait of the Don (on Don Giovanni, 1987), Catfish Row (on Porgy and Bess, 1997) and Tales from Windsor Forest (on Falstaff, 1997).)
A consistent feature of Orr's surprisingly large output is his music for brass or wind band, some ten in total and composed across his career. There are two concertos, for trombone (1971) and for trumpet (1976), both with brass band, and a number of other pieces, not least A John Gay Suite for symphonic wind band (1972), Tournament for ten solo brass (1985) and the recent Narration for symphonic winds (1993), drawn from music for The Alchemist, an opera on which Orr was still working at the time of his death. (He left part of the first act orchestrated and the rest complete in piano score. After Benjamin Frankel's death in 1973 Orr orchestrated the piano score of Frankel's opera Marching Song; The Alchemist now requires another composer to perform Orr the same service.)
There is also a substantial corpus of chamber music, including two string quartets, three piano trios (the only "serious" Orr to have been recorded on CD), a recent string trio, and most of the series of six Refrains, composed between 1970 and 1992 for a variety of instrumental forces; these are basically extended rondo structures in which, as the composer put it, "a recurrent idea is used to bind together a total structure".
But a dry list of compositions doesn't give a picture of the man, of the delighted twinkle in his eye when he was discussing something he held important (I once sat virtually speechless through a dinner where Orr and Hans Keller discussed, with genuine passion, the significance of a particular gesture in a single bar in the slow movement of a Mozart piano concerto). And he never lost that Scottish ability to draw the humour from misfortune.
He told with glee of attending a performance of Billy Budd at the Royal Opera House when he was suddenly stricken with the most appalling upheaval in his stomach.
Fearing the worst, he swiftly pushed his way past the knees and baleful glares of the stalls audience to try to get out in time. And, Orr would ask with a grin, what do you think the sailors' chorus on stage was singing at this point? "Heave! Oh, heave!"
It is time the classical world caught up with the music of Buxton Orr. The recording of the Piano Trios appeared around a year ago on the Marco Polo label, and A John Gay Suite is due out before too long from Naxos, Marco Polo's sister, budget label; A Celtic Suite for strings (1968) has also been recorded by Black Box.
But that will hardly give an adequate picture of Orr's ability as a composer. Two CD programmes - a coupling of the Sinfonia Ricercante and Triptych and, less ambitiously, a disc of the two String Quartets and the String Trio - push themselves forward as an obvious place to start.

Greenhouse gas deal is a small step for mankind The Kyoto Climate Change Summit could prove to be a major watershed in international relations, writes Frank McDonald, Environment Correspondent: [CITY EDITION]

Abstract: If one believes Michael Grubb of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change will be seen as standing alongside the Treaty of Versailles and the Bretton Woods agreement as one of the major deals of the modern era. It is probably too early to judge whether Mr Grubb has got it right. Nonetheless, the fact that 160 countries with very diverse agendas were able to agree on a protocol to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions blamed by scientists for causing climate change must be ranked as a significant step forward. That's why it was so important to get flexibility from the United States, as the world's largest single polluter, accounting for nearly 25 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions. The US came to Kyoto offering merely to stabilise its emissions at 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012, but left after agreeing to a 7 per cent reduction.

Full text: If one believes Michael Grubb of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change will be seen as standing alongside the Treaty of Versailles and the Bretton Woods agreement as one of the major deals of the modern era.
It is probably too early to judge whether Mr Grubb has got it right. Nonetheless, the fact that 160 countries with very diverse agendas were able to agree on a protocol to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions blamed by scientists for causing climate change must be ranked as a significant step forward.
Apart from the preservation of biological diversity, progress on measures to curb climate change was the sine qua non of any credible international effort to protect the global environment. Though every country has its own environmental problems, the threat posed by climate changes eclipses them all.
This threat could be confronted only on the basis of equity. There was simply no way that developing countries such as China and India were going to agree to limit their greenhouse gas emissions without a "firm purpose of amendment" in advance from the industrialised nations which caused the problem in the first place.
That's why it was so important to get flexibility from the United States, as the world's largest single polluter, accounting for nearly 25 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions. The US came to Kyoto offering merely to stabilise its emissions at 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012, but left after agreeing to a 7 per cent reduction.
All the indications, however, are that the Kyoto deal hailed by President Clinton will not be ratified by the US Senate, at least with its present political complexion. And the fossil fuel lobby, led by the Global Climate Coalition, is already working hard to ensure that this important agreement bites the dust on the Senate floor.
The Kyoto protocol will be open for signature from next March, and it is expected that President Clinton will make quite a show of signing it. Along with his vice-president, Mr Al Gore, who hopes to be the Democratic Party's nominee for the White House in 2000, he seeks to court the large environmental lobby in the US.
Mr Clinton and Mr Gore may also be banking on the prospect that the influence of the fossil fuel lobby will begin to wane in the aftermath of Kyoto. Certainly, with the year-by-year rise in the number of weather-related catastrophes worldwide, it is likely that the insurance industry will become increasingly vocal.
1997 has been a year of spectacular disasters. The once-in-a-century floods in Poland, the Czech Republic and eastern Germany during last July and August caused 120 deaths, led to 187,000 people being evacuated from their homes and are estimated to have cost at least $5 billion in damage to property. Other extreme weather events in 1997 included the worst drought this century in northern China, the worst floods within living memory in East Africa, torrential rains and flash floods in the western US and a hurricane in Mexico which destroyed 97 per cent of the corn crop and damaged numerous tourist hotels in Acapulco.
Few but the "contrarians" continue to doubt the verdict of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change that human activity is altering our climate. There can also be little doubt that the next assessment from the IPCC, which is made up of 2,500 scientists from around the world, will consolidate this thesis.
By next autumn, when the fourth Conference of the Parties to the UN Climate Change Convention gathers in Buenos Aires, the scientific evidence will be even stronger and major players such as the US will find it more difficult to argue in favour of loopholes to evade taking action to deal with the problem.
But even if the cuts in greenhouse gas emissions agreed in Kyoto had been as deep as the European Union initially sought, they would not have been enough to halt climate change. One way or the other, this phenomenon is likely to continue for 100 years or more, even if greenhouse gas emissions are stabilised.
What Kyoto did was to send out a message - however weak and compromised - that we need to change our ways. The profligate society which wastes the world's resources must yield to a more rational dispensation, which puts the emphasis on energy conservation, efficiency and the exploitation of renewable sources.
This is already happening, particularly in Europe. Greater use of urban public transport and national rail networks as well as unprecedented levels of investment in wind and solar energy are all paying dividends in terms of reducing atmospheric pollution and putting the EU at the forefront of technological innovation.
Though the EU managed to portray itself as "the light of the world" in Kyoto, it is still open to question whether it will now soften its commitment to achieve a 15 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010 in any renegotiation of its current burden-sharing arrangement - the so-called "bubble". Under the present deal, Ireland is meant to cap the increase in its emissions at 15 per cent - a target which IBEC, for example, regards as quite unrealistic. For without firm action, as the Minister for the Environment, Mr Dempsey, warned in Kyoto, Ireland's emissions could be 55 per cent higher in the year 2010.
The acid test of the EU's commitment will be whether its 15 finance ministers can agree on a Union-wide carbon tax. This was originally floated by the European Commission in 1992, at the time of the Earth Summit, but it has since become bogged down in the mire of consensus decision-making on fiscal measures.
Britain's deputy prime minister, Mr John Prescott, has said that Kyoto provided a "window of credibility" for the industrialised world to show the developing countries it was genuinely prepared to take action on climate change. If they are to be brought on board, that credibility will have to be built on between now and Buenos Aires.

Insurance firms face an avalanche of storm claims Some of the implications of last week's storm, now acknowledged as the worst in Ireland for 23 years, are assessed by Frank McDonald, Environment Correspondent: [CITY EDITION]

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/insurance-firms-face-avalanche-storm-claims-some/docview/310339193/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: The chairman of the Heritage Council's architectural committee, Mr David Slattery, expects that its phones will be ringing this morning with distress calls from owners of historic buildings. Insurance companies are also bracing themselves for what could amount to an avalanche of claims for storm damage. "There's no doubt that some historic buildings in substandard condition which were awaiting funds for repairs have probably suffered considerable damage," Mr Slattery told The Irish Times. "These would be buildings with slates gone from the roof which were already at risk of not surviving the winter." The Heritage Council has been allocated an extra (pounds) 500,000 towards its grants scheme for architecturally important buildings. But that sum was intended to help clear its current backlog of cases rather than to deal with new appeals from property owners facing repair bills after the storm.

Full text: The chairman of the Heritage Council's architectural committee, Mr David Slattery, expects that its phones will be ringing this morning with distress calls from owners of historic buildings. Insurance companies are also bracing themselves for what could amount to an avalanche of claims for storm damage.
"There's no doubt that some historic buildings in substandard condition which were awaiting funds for repairs have probably suffered considerable damage," Mr Slattery told The Irish Times. "These would be buildings with slates gone from the roof which were already at risk of not surviving the winter."
The Heritage Council has been allocated an extra (pounds) 500,000 towards its grants scheme for architecturally important buildings. But that sum was intended to help clear its current backlog of cases rather than to deal with new appeals from property owners facing repair bills after the storm.
Mr Slattery said the increasing frequency of storms - which may be linked with global climate change - had already brought about changes in the design of new buildings, particularly in terms of roof pitches, in an effort to protect them against wind speeds higher than 80 m.p.h.
A spokesman for Hibernian Insurance said storm damage was an "integral part" of the vast majority of insurance policies for domestic or commercial buildings. Most reputable companies also offer a helpline service to put people in touch with contractors to carry out emergency repairs.
Mr Malcolm Hughes, chief executive of Farrell and Associates, a leading Dublin firm of loss adjusters, said the biggest problem facing householders who suffered storm damage would be to find a contractor, given that the building industry is officially on holiday until next Monday.
He also believed that roofing contractors would be reluctant to carry out major repairs "until the weather dies down". And with another storm forecast for tomorrow, running into New Year's Eve, he expected it would take some time before much of the damage to buildings is finally repaired
Mr Hughes expects that last week's storm would be the most significant he has had to deal with, primarily because the damage was so widespread. "The payout will be much higher than for Hurricane Charlie," he predicted.
Many claims are expected to include compensation for food which defrosted in home freezers during electricity cuts. These will be against the insurance companies rather than the ESB. Mr Hughes pointed out that the removal of fallen trees is not covered unless they have caused damage to buildings.
He stressed that no insurance company would seek to evade claims under a household policy by defining the storm as an "act of God". Such a defence could prove useful, however, to a householder against a public liability claim from a passer-by who had been injured by slates falling from a roof.
Trees have been the major casualties of last week's storm. The arboretum on Fota Island, Co Cork, has lost some of its older specimen trees, including some exotic varieties. "Trees are down all over the place", said Mr Barney Whelan, a spokesman for the ESB, who had been touring the worst affected areas, including West Cork. "Ash, beech, sycamore and other native hardwoods have been brought down everywhere, particularly in exposed hilly areas and up side roads."
The storm inevitably hit farmers. Cowsheds in hillside locations had their roofs blown off. There was also damage to sea defences on the shoreline, particularly around Youghal and Dungarvan.
The ESB's work to restore power lines was hampered in many places by fallen trees. Emergency crews had to carry new poles up the side of Mount Eagle, in Co Limerick, because fallen trees and hilly terrain prevented access by vehicles, including JCBs.
More trees are likely to be felled by the storm forecast for tomorrow or Wednesday. Last week's storm was south-easterly, veering south-westerly; the next one is forecast to be a north-westerly. Trees which survived Christmas Eve may be felled by high winds from the opposite direction.
But it's an ill wind that blows no good. Ten years ago, when a similar storm ravaged southern England, environmentalists initially regarded its impact on the landscape as catastrophic. The latest view, however, is that it had a regenerative effect by getting rid of so many old trees.

Full text: The truth is out there: Is the threat of global warming genuine - or is it an over-stated myth? New books illuminate the forces that fight for our hearts and minds on this issue. It's in our best interests to understand the reasons behind the conflict.
THE HEAT IS ON: THE HIGH STAKES BATTLE OVER EARTH'S THREATENED CLIMATE
By Ross Gelbspan
Addison Wesley, 278 pp., $31.50
THE QUIET LIMIT OF THE WORLD: A JOURNEY TO THE NORTH POLE TO INVESTIGATE GLOBAL WARMING
By Wayne Grady
Macfarlane, Walter & Ross,
266 pp., $29.95
THE WAR AGAINST THE GREENS: THE WISE USE MOVEMENT, THE NEW RIGHT AND ANTI-ENVIRONMENTAL VIOLENCE
By David Helvarg
Sierra Club Books, 502 pp., $32.50
A group of learned skeptics gathered recently at a conference sponsored by the Fraser Institute, a conservative think-tank, to debunk the notions of global warming that are generally endorsed by their mainstream colleagues.
They sounded plausible, even persuasive, citing a variety of sources to challenge the view that human industrial activity - primarily through the burning of fossil fuel - is loading unprecedented amounts of carbon-based gases into the atmosphere and triggering a greenhouse effect.
At best, they seem to suggest, the current mainstream consensus that global warming is underway is an hysterical exaggeration of naturally occurring climatic cycles. At worst it's an outright hoax perpetrated to further the political agenda of radical green cultists.
But Andrew Weaver, recent winner of the prestigious Steacie Award and a highly-respected professor at the University of Victoria School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, dismisses the arguments raised against global warming as a product of economic agendas rather than objective science.
"There is a lobby group that wants to put these people in high profile. But none of those people are experts in climate. They have no argument," he says.
"They are so out of touch. A lot other evidence has come on board. It's very compelling. There is no doubt about that evidence. We can say it [global warming] is caused by human beings. That is well established. We are sure of it."
And Weaver is equally dismissive in his critique of the media's decision to take these attacks on global warming seriously.
"You have editors who are essentially business editors, who know squat about the science and whose opinions should be discounted to zero," he says.
So, is the threat of global warming genuine - after all, a federal scientific panel looking into the matter once said that only a thermo-nuclear exchange between superpowers gives humans the potential to so radically change the world in which they live - or is it largely an over-stated myth cooked up by eco-nuts, goddess worshippers and left-wing chicken littles?
To understand the context in which scientists like Weaver frame their skepticism of the skeptics, David Helvarg's The War Against the Greens offers a meticulously documented insight into the evolution of a backlash that serves not knowledge but the financial interests of resource industries.
He charts the careful corporate construction of a pseudo- grassroots citizens' movement - in which British Columbia's own Share movement finds its conceptual origins - which has as its long- term objective the deregulated and unrestricted use of timber, oil, gas, mineral and range land, not to mention the abolition of environmental laws and enforcement agencies.
Behind this "Wise Use" agenda is the financial backing of South African mining companies, Canadian and American timber companies, huge Japanese conglomerates, the National Rifle Association and even the ultra-conservative Unification Church of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.
"Only in the cynical argot of Washington, where `perception is reality,' could a corporate-sponsored environmental backlash successfully sell itself as a populist movement," Helvarg says.
"If the anti-enviros' links to the Farm Bureau, Heritage Foundation, NRA, logging companies, resource trade associations, multi-national gold mining companies, Japanese ORV manufacturers and a Korean billionaire who thinks he's God prove anything, it's that large industrial lobbies and transnational corporations have learned how to play the grassroots game."
"Confusionism" is what mainstream scientists call the sniping from the fringes, frequently from individuals whose own research is heavily funded by vested interests like the coal industry.
And it can be seductive to the simple-minded.
The mainstream media, enmeshed as it is with large-scale corporate culture, often appears to remain doubtful about the consensus of mainstream science. It's a peculiar reversal of the media's usual tendency to embrace the mainstream and to doubt the efficacy of fringe groups in politics, economics and culture.
Indeed, the publicist's release promoting Wayne Grady's book The Quiet Limit of the World, the chronicle of a 1994 scientific expedition to the Arctic to study global warming, consists of a series of plainly argued factual refutations of a recent editorial in The Globe and Mail which advocated caution in responding to calls for action to curb the release of greenhouse gases.
If there is a public perception of increasingly severe weather events around the globe, this does not prove that global warming is the culprit, the newspaper argued.
Grady, with elegant prose and graceful logic, weaves natural science, oceanography and Arctic history into a forceful narrative that compels the discerning reader to conclude otherwise.
He explains from firsthand knowledge how scientists discovered that the polar ice cap is 30 per cent thinner than it was in 1987 and how new data and more sophisticated computer modelling now link severe weather events around the world to the accelerated warming of the earth.
In fact, he points out, the years 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996 have one disturbing thing in common - they are the five hottest years in recorded human history. And after Europe's sweltering summer, 1997 will probably join the list.
The consequences are already observable in the Canadian arctic. Mean annual temperatures a metre beneath the tundra have risen by more than a degree in the past decade and the permafrost has begun to melt, triggering 2,000 landslides and leaving a moonscape of sink holes and foreshores eroded by storm surges from the Arctic ocean.
If the polar ice caps melt quickly and completely, warns Grady, "we'll be living on a different planet."
Another bracing antidote to the self-interested nonsense from economists and corporate spin doctors that now masquerades as science is the work of Ross Gelbspan, one of those shoe leather investigative reporters who comes with a Pulitzer Prize and a distinguished professional pedigree from The Boston Globe, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Washington Post.
Gelbspan systematically flays the confusionist arguments, revealing in the process the pathology of a troubling attempt to distort the nature of scientific debate, advance self-serving corporate agendas and to plant doubts in the public mind regarding the indisputable facts of climate change that are supported by the scientific method.
He begins not with theory, but with concrete, easily-observable events.
"In January 1995 a vast section of ice the size of Rhode Island broke off the Larsen ice shelf in Antarctica," Gelbspan points out. "Although it received scant coverage in the press, it was one of the most spectacular and nightmarish manifestations yet of the ominous changes occurring on the planet."
Then he quotes Dr. Rodolfo del Valle, the Argentine scientist who witnessed the disintegration of the 20,000-year-old ice shelves:
"If conditions remain unchanged (rising global temperatures) could cause catastrophic flooding all over the world. We thought the flooding would occur over the course of several centuries, but the whole process has been much quicker than we anticipated."
Since then, a 65-kilometre-long crack has opened in the adjoining ice shelf and work by Columbia University scientists discovered that the entire west Antarctic ice sheet is losing mass to the oceans.
Mainstream science remains divided on whether this instability indicates the imminent collapse of the ice sheet, but one thing is not in dispute - Antarctica serves as an immense global thermostat regulating the ocean temperatures and currents which determine both weather and climate on the continents we inhabit.
Meddle with it and things will change.
Small wonder, then, that while one group of corporate interests seeks to manipulate the public perception of reality to the benefit of its bottom line, another - the insurance industry - is beginning to sweat bullets at the prospect of global warming.
That's because one of the consequences of atmospheric change predicted by the mathematical modelling of climatologists is an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.
Last year at a conference in Toronto, the Insurance Bureau of Canada presented a vision of global warming that was far from that presented at the Fraser Institute in Vancouver.
"Climate change has brought a growing flood of catastrophic damage that is expected to get even worse. Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, hailstorms, floods, drought - all have become more frequent and much more intense," delegates were told.
"In high-risk areas, insurance companies have been bankrupted, premiums increased, protection reduced and some property owners left with no insurance protection."
There is good news in this bad news, Gelbspan says. Eyeing the prospect of a $50-billion payout if Miami takes a direct hit from some warming-intensified hurricane, insurance underwriters are suddenly discovering the merits in green arguments.
And so The Heat is On is more than a depressing lament, it's also an expression of hope and a call to action. One of the most hopeful developments, he argues, is this emerging coalition between one of the global corporate giants of the information age - the insurance industry - and the environmental movement.
Another, he says, is the fact that we have the possibility of a fix in clean alternative energy sources - solar power, wind power, tidal power - and new technologies like the hydrogen fuel cell which permits internal combustion engines without burning the polluting hydrocarbons that contribute to global warming.
This fix won't be cheap or easy, but it will be cheaper and easier than waiting for the coming changes to overwhelm us.
In the meantime, what's shaping up says Gelbspan, is a conflict in which the insurance industry will use its formidable resources to battle the fossil fuel industry for the control of public perceptions of reality.
Think of what's ahead as a battle between the information age of the future and the dirty industrial age of the past.
An informed, educated public will play a critical role in determining its outcome, Gelbspan says. Books like these contribute powerfully to that education.

On the slow train from Kyoto: [ALL Edition]

Abstract: If there were a contest for the most overblown news event of 1997, the global warming summit in Kyoto ought to win hands down. The editors of the Bangor Daily News were charitable in labeling it merely "hot air." An inordinate amount of political energy has gone into the discussion of largely unenforceable numerical targets for reductions in greenhouse gases. In the process, the conference has distracted us from the real issue, the economic gains that sensible greenhouse reduction strategies would bring. The hallow nature of the Kyoto summit is highlighted when we consider the quieter but more significant politics of transit policy in the United States. While U.S. delegates to the global summit trumpeted this nation's new found commitment to the environment, Congress struggled to approve a paltry two year, $2.3 billion subsidy for Amtrak. Both Congress and the environmentalist president are now on record that all subsidies for Amtrak will cease by 2002.

Full text: If there were a contest for the most overblown news event of 1997, the global warming summit in Kyoto ought to win hands down. The editors of the Bangor Daily News were charitable in labeling it merely "hot air." An inordinate amount of political energy has gone into the discussion of largely unenforceable numerical targets for reductions in greenhouse gases. In the process, the conference has distracted us from the real issue, the economic gains that sensible greenhouse reduction strategies would bring.
The hallow nature of the Kyoto summit is highlighted when we consider the quieter but more significant politics of transit policy in the United States. While U.S. delegates to the global summit trumpeted this nation's new found commitment to the environment, Congress struggled to approve a paltry two year, $2.3 billion subsidy for Amtrak. Both Congress and the environmentalist president are now on record that all subsidies for Amtrak will cease by 2002.
The decision slowly to starve Amtrak is misguided economics and destructive ecology. Maine, which is on the receiving end of dirty Northeastern air and growing summertime gridlock, has a disproportionate stake in this debate. The logic behind the unending war on Amtrak is that old canard: the free market should decide our transit options.
Even as an economics 101 theorem, this nostrum runs into immense problems. Healthy transportation systems expand markets and convey benefits to far more than the initial users and purchasers. Transit is an activity that catalyzes and encourages many other economic activities. Because of these spillover effects, market price is a poor guide to transit policy. From the earliest days of our republic, governments at all levels have sought to guide transit policy. Generous subsidies favored canals and rail in the nineteenth century. Without this intervention our economic growth would have been substantially slower.
More startling is how one sided we are in demanding that rails pay their own way. Federal grants to Amtrak are "operating subsidies," but the billions spent every year to police mid eastern oil is "national defense." When rail workers maintain or upgrade a road bed, they are engaged in "rail work." When police or fire fighters come to the scene of a traffic accident, they are performing "police work." Jane Holtz Kay, the author of Asphalt Nation, has recently calculated that twenty percent of all state and local budgetary expenditure is auto related, yet motorists pay far less than this amount directly. Kay estimates that if the cost of gas relfected the real social costs of auto related transit, gas would be at least $5.00 a gallon. Yet how many of us refer disapprovingly to the "subsidized gas" on which our auto travel depends?
What have we bought with our subsidized auto transit? The United States has the least efficient transit system in the advanced industrial world. Two decades ago, Ivan Illich pointed out that when we consider the hours needed to earn the post tax dollars to purchase a car, charges for its insurance and repair, the time spent in traffic and in search of parking, our cars really move us at about five miles an hour. We would do much better on bikes, but modern cities seldom make that safe or practical.
A calculation using Illich's methodology today would doubtless yield even more discouraging numbers. Europeans with their more balanced transit policies have achieved greater levels of mobility for substantially less cost. Much of the enhanced competitiveness of Europe and Japan in recent years is a reflection of the greater ease in moving people and product components.
Not surprisingly, the ecological consequences are just as disheartening. The auto alone is responsible for a third of all U.S. greenhouse emissions. And even while parked, the car is an ecological disaster. The Environment and Forecasting Institute in Heidelberg estimates that about a third of U.S. energy goes to production of the auto and the infrastructure needed to sustain it. And every year autos kill about 40,000 of our fellow citizens and maim hundreds of thousands.
Unfortunately, alternatives to the auto are caught in their own vicious circles. Amtrak's critics correctly point out that service is often slow and equipment old and uncomfortable. But slow service and dilapidated equipment are consequences of a generation of underfunded capital needs. These conditions in turn make it hard to attract new customers and build the political and financial foundation for further growth.
Nothing speaks as clearly to the power of the auto in our politics and culture as events in Washington and Kyoto. Amtrak is slowly starved and the Kyoto meetings talk more about abstract targets than about the future of the auto. Some will say that Americans love cars, and surely even radical critics can't challenge that assertion. But their love of cars might be tempered by more honest discussion of the the causes and consequences of an auto-dependent society. And if Americans love cars so much, shouldn't cars be able to pay their own way in the free market?

Global climate change treaty could be boon for Wisconsin: [All Edition]

Abstract: As details of the global climate change treaty in Kyoto emerge, the economic doom-and-gloom forces already have begun unleashing their public relations blitzkrieg on the treaty. The Wisconsin Farm Bureau and American Forest Association have blasted the treaty as an economic disaster when quite the opposite could be true. I believe there's a better way. Wisconsin's 22 coal-fired power plants produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity. With minor adjustments, each coal-fired plant could include biomass wood waste and crops with coal for fuel. Presently, only two coal plants include biomass. For instance, a 5% replacement of coal with biomass would create the equivalent of a 350 megawatt power plant and require 1 million tons annually of state-grown biomass, creating up to 3,000 rural jobs. As the coal and fossil fuel "soot advocates" attempt to frighten Americans with an economic doomsday scenario, remember that a strong climate treaty can create an economic boom for Wisconsin. Americans can choose to roll up their sleeves and begin a cleanup or they can sit back, complain and deny the mess even exists. You decide.

Full text: As details of the global climate change treaty in Kyoto emerge, the economic doom-and-gloom forces already have begun unleashing their public relations blitzkrieg on the treaty. The Wisconsin Farm Bureau and American Forest Association have blasted the treaty as an economic disaster when quite the opposite could be true.
Whether or not global warming is true, a strong global climate treaty could result in an economic boom for Wisconsin.
Currently, Wisconsin imports 90% of its energy, sending $6 billion annually to coal states such as Wyoming and petroleum exporters such as Iraq.
I believe there's a better way. Wisconsin's 22 coal-fired power plants produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity. With minor adjustments, each coal-fired plant could include biomass wood waste and crops with coal for fuel. Presently, only two coal plants include biomass. For instance, a 5% replacement of coal with biomass would create the equivalent of a 350 megawatt power plant and require 1 million tons annually of state-grown biomass, creating up to 3,000 rural jobs.
Estimates show that 4.5 million tons of wood residue is available in Wisconsin yearly or enough biomass to offset 20% of our coal use.
Wisconsin agriculture has the potential of completely displacing our state's transportation fuel imports with biofuels such as soy diesel and non-corn-based ethanol. A 10% blend of biofuels statewide (as Minnesota requires) could retain $400 million to $800 million annually in Wisconsin's economy.
These fiscal estimates don't begin to include the environmental and health savings expected from a significant reduction in fossil fuel use.
As the coal and fossil fuel "soot advocates" attempt to frighten Americans with an economic doomsday scenario, remember that a strong climate treaty can create an economic boom for Wisconsin. Americans can choose to roll up their sleeves and begin a cleanup or they can sit back, complain and deny the mess even exists. You decide.
Michael Mangan Emerald Energy Delafield Treaty would
hurt Wisconsin farmers The global climate change treaty will have
a negative impact on farmers' costs of production.
One of the most disturbing elements of the treaty is that negotiations were done without input from agriculture on incentives and programs that can help reduce energy use. Had that been done, this treaty could boost opportunities for agriculture to continue its contribution to environmental protection, instead of having the threat of higher fuel and electricity costs.
At the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation annual meeting Dec. 9, farmers approved resolutions to support state and national energy policies that encourage energy conservation and alternative sources of energy from agricultural products.
Farmers want an energy policy that promotes an increase in production and marketing of agricultural-based fuels such as switch grass, supports the use and production of ethanol from corn and provides incentives and research for converting farm waste and farm products such as whey to energy.
Farmers are probably the biggest contributors to environmental protection and hold the potential for more advancements in finding alternative sources of energy.
Increasing markets and the use of agricultural products will perhaps raise farm income to offset higher costs of production. A national policy of incentives and research will open the doors for those opportunities.
Tom Thieding Executive director Communications Wisconsin
Farm Bureau Federation Thomas should heed his own warning In
his column of Dec. 17, Cal Thomas makes a valid point when he writes that we should be cautious as we listen to the debate on global warming.
We should indeed: While Thomas appears persuasive, he omits information crucial to the reader's full understanding. I'll cite just one example.
S. Fred Singer, whom Thomas quotes at length, is one of a handful of scientists regularly cited by those who oppose pollution restrictions. But Thomas does not tell us what writer Ross Gelbspan does in his 1997 book, "The Heat is On."
Singer openly acknowledges that he is funded at least in part by Exxon, Shell, ARCO, Unocal and Sun oil companies, whose economic survival depends on our continuing to favor fossil fuels over energy sources that do not compromise air quality.
Moreover, on a 1994 edition of "Nightline," Singer did not deny having received funding from the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, to whose newspaper he regularly contributes.
Thomas accuses "the usually fair (Ted) Koppel" of calling Singer and his fellow skeptics "ignorant members of the Flat Earth Society.`
Had Thomas given readers more information about Singer, his funding and his political associations, readers would be in a better position to judge for themselves.
Victoria Thorpe Miller Hales Corners U.N. already doing bad
job The subject of global warming will be a hotbed of discussion
for many years to come.
My concern is with the United Nations dictating to individual countries what an acceptable amount of pollution would be. United Nations control over the fees it wants to impose will create another unnecessary bureaucracy.
For that matter, the U.N. is not doing a very good job addressing the issues within its control, such as the hunger and starvation that continue to plague Third World nations, the U.N.'s budget, which it cannot balance, and weapons-control monitoring in Iraq. I am more fearful of biological warfare than whether the Earth will get another degree warmer over the next hundred years.
If the United States fails to meet its requirements for reducing greenhouse gases, will we be sending billions of dollars to the U.N.? Will any of this money be sent to countries that are being run by dictators or warlords?
Individual governments should set their own standards and benchmarks. The people of this country have a voice if they want to make changes to address the environment.
By the way, did anyone notice if these delegates flew separately or jet-pooled?

The findings on this issue are not all conclusive and no such treaty without Senate consent should be even proposed. This has become purely a political issue using an emotional appeal without substantive evidence.
Janet G. Jacobs Elm Grove Warming is serious issue In the Dec. 13 Journal Sentinel, Stuart Carlson's cartoon made light fun of the idea of global warming.
After reading Ross Gelbspan's new book, "The Heat Is On," I realize we have to get very serious about this.
Gelbspan offers two ideas that are very persuasive: First, the overwhelming consensus of scientific thought is that we are in the early stages of the heating of the atmosphere. Second, the world's insurance companies are leading the opposition against the coal and oil industries because insurance payouts for weather-related damages reached $57 billion for the 1990s.

NATURE WILL JUDGE KYOTO SUCCESS: [FINAL EDITION]

Abstract: Judged by the enormous political obstacles confronting delegates, the international agreement on addressing climate change reached in Kyoto, Japan this week is an extraordinary political success. President Clinton and the U.S. delegation deserve great credit for resisting a $13 million advertising campaign by fossil-fuel interests to block the treaty. Their duplicitous message to Americans was "don't do anything unless developing countries who emit far less pollution do the same" while their lobbyists concurrently button-holed delegates from developing nations in the Kyoto's convention halls urging them not to sign a treaty. By adhering to the requirement of the 1992 Rio Treaty that exempts the large developing nations from the first round of energy cuts, the administration preserved America's diplomatic credibility while agreeing to U.S. cuts that are achievable. America's initial treaty obligation of 7 percent cuts below 1990 levels will, in contrast to industry doomsayers, create more jobs and more wealth for the American economy. That 7 percent number translates into a cut of about 20 percent below current emission levels because we're emitting roughly 13 percent more today than in 1990. But more than 2,000 economists and many energy specialists, including Amory Lovins at the Rocky Mountain Institute and analysts at the Tellus Institute in Boston, say that we can cut up to 30 percent simply by implementing conservation and energy efficiency measures. These moves will spark new industries, create jobs and save existing firms millions on their energy bills.

Full text: Judged by the enormous political obstacles confronting delegates, the international agreement on addressing climate change reached in Kyoto, Japan this week is an extraordinary political success.
Judged by the accelerating effects of greenhouse gas emissions on our increasingly unstable climate, Kyoto is a mere dress rehearsal for the much larger effort that lays ahead.
First, the good news. While intransigent senators backed by fossil-fuel-dependent businesses say it goes too far and many environmentalists say it contains loopholes that doom it to uselessness, the "Kyoto Protocol" is an unprecedented diplomatic milestone.
For the first time, more than 150 nations have agreed that we must work together to keep the planet hospitable for our children.
President Clinton and the U.S. delegation deserve great credit for resisting a $13 million advertising campaign by fossil-fuel interests to block the treaty. Their duplicitous message to Americans was "don't do anything unless developing countries who emit far less pollution do the same" while their lobbyists concurrently button-holed delegates from developing nations in the Kyoto's convention halls urging them not to sign a treaty. By adhering to the requirement of the 1992 Rio Treaty that exempts the large developing nations from the first round of energy cuts, the administration preserved America's diplomatic credibility while agreeing to U.S. cuts that are achievable.
America's initial treaty obligation of 7 percent cuts below 1990 levels will, in contrast to industry doomsayers, create more jobs and more wealth for the American economy. That 7 percent number translates into a cut of about 20 percent below current emission levels because we're emitting roughly 13 percent more today than in 1990. But more than 2,000 economists and many energy specialists, including Amory Lovins at the Rocky Mountain Institute and analysts at the Tellus Institute in Boston, say that we can cut up to 30 percent simply by implementing conservation and energy efficiency measures. These moves will spark new industries, create jobs and save existing firms millions on their energy bills.
The administration might actually find allies in the fossil fuel community. British Petroleum has acknowledged the destructive potentials of climate change and announced a large investment in solar energy. In October, the president of General Motors called for carbon taxes to reduce emissions. Recently, Shell announced its intention to invest $500 million in renewable energies. These energy industry leaders understand the overriding scientific evidence - and the need to position their companies prominently for the world's inevitable energy transition.
Unfortunately, there is another perspective from which to judge the outcome of Kyoto, and that is the perspective of nature.
The deep oceans are warming, causing the breakup of Antarctic ice shelves and fueling, in the views of many scientists, longer and more destructive El Nino weather patterns. The Alaskan tundra, which for thousands of years absorbed carbon dioxide and methane (two key greenhouse gases), is now thawing and releasing those gases into the atmosphere. The permafrost in Siberia and Alaska is turning to pea soup. Tropical diseases are migrating north. Insurance losses to floods, droughts and severe storms are escalating by orders of magnitude. And people all over the world are increasingly vulnerable to weather-driven food shortages, property losses and personal trauma from the succession of extreme weather events, which are occurring with frightening regularity all over the world. While diplomats have argued over politically realistic cuts, the science clearly tells us that to restore our atmosphere to a hospitable state we must cut our emissions by a staggering 60 percent to 70 percent.
That is a large task - but it is one that can and must ultimately be achieved. In the U.S., we should begin the process by changing our subsidy policies. Today the federal government spends $25 billion subsidizing big coal and big oil. If all those tax credits, subsidies and incentives were diverted to the commercialization of renewable energies, it would propel them into the big league of global commerce. We should also work to deregulate the electric utility industry in a way that encourages renewable energy sources.
Ultimately a comprehensive global energy transition away from coal and oil and to climate-friendly, renewable technologies requires a partnership between the world's governments and its energy giants. The profit stream of $2 trillion in oil and coal commerce must shift to windmill plants in India, solar assemblies in El Salvador, hydrogen-producing photovoltaic farms in the deserts of the Middle East and fuel cell factories in Cleveland.
That kind of energy transition would create an economic boom and generate millions of jobs all over the globe. It would begin to reverse the widening economic gap between the North and the South. And in short order the renewable energy industry would eclipse high technology as the central driving engine of growth of the global economy.
Measured against the rather paltry reductions envisioned at Kyoto, the task seems indeed daunting. Measured against the destabilization of the global climate, it is imperative. The treaty at Kyoto is a small beginning. But it contains the seeds for a monumental sea change which could help all nations - developed and developing - prosper even as it helps pacify our inflamed climate.

Full text: OTTAWA Those two rivals for the right, Preston Manning and Jean Charest, offer up the same Christmas wish: that the other guy would disappear.
Before he flew off for sunny climes Monday, Manning gave an interview on CBC Newsworld, in which he wished aloud that Charest would take himself off to replace Daniel Johnson as leader of the Quebec Liberals.
With their young leader thus disposed, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada could divide and be absorbed by other parties. "Red Tories could join the Liberals and Blue Tories could join us, and everybody would be happy," Manning said.
Charest, meanwhile, held a news conference at which he again singled out Reform MP Darrel Stinson, who recently offered to punch him out, as proof that Manning's party is too extremist for most Canadians' palates.
Reform's a short-term party, too regional and too divisive to last for long on the political scene, Charest argued. By contrast, the Conservatives, around since Confederation, are the respectable national alternative to the Liberals and will reap their reward in the next election.
Seven months after the election that gave Reform 60 seats and the Conservatives 20, but an equal split 19 per cent each of the right- wing vote, the two parties show no signs of uniting. Reform has no seats east of Manitoba and the Tories only two west of Quebec. But neither is yet ready to concede: each party still hopes to wipe the other out, and each still prefers to continue a fratricidal battle in hopes of eventually claiming all the spoils.
Manning, delighting in the trappings of being Leader of the Opposition, seems pained by the historic Conservative party's persistence.
Manning is second only to Prime Minister Jean Chretien, and perhaps to Finance Minister Paul Martin, in the amount of media attention he gets. As opposition leader, he can dominate question period because he is allotted the opening questions, helping set Parliament's agenda.
Monday, when he left Calgary on holidays, his office said that only Sandra Manning knew the couple's itinerary, an obvious signal they were heading to the sun for 10 days but prefer we don't know. Manning's staff diverted attention by throwing a party for press gallery reporters at a downtown Ottawa tavern.
Charest, at his news conference, noted matter-of-factly that nightly news coverage concentrates only on the government and the official opposition, with very little attention paid the three other parties. He's right, of course.
But a few points about the media's part in his relative obscurity. First, Charest sometimes wants attention for very little, a case in point being Monday. The press release announcing his news conference promised he'd unveil his party's four-year plan for rebuilding, but all he had to say was that he'd be holding a series of round tables of experts on the pressing issues of the day.
Second, reporters know that if Johnson resigns or is defeated in the next Quebec election, Charest will be under great pressure to save Canada by replacing Johnson as leader of Quebec's only federalist party. Until the election, Charest can protest all he wants, but we all suspect his future lies elsewhere.
Third, on the big issues, Charest's comments are too often a pale echo of Manning's. There are nuances in how the two parties would go about it but Charest, like Manning, is calling for tax cuts before all else. Like Manning, he calls for more power-sharing with the provinces. And, like Manning, he says the commitment made by the Liberal government in Kyoto last week to reduce greenhouse gases six per cent below 1990 levels is unachievable.
The difference here is that Charest, a former federal environment minister, believes the climate change threat is real and must be combatted. So, it's difficult to understand why he's put himself in the same doubters' camp as Manning, unless he hopes by doing so to gain points with big business, which so far is backing the Liberal government.
In a quieter mode, and therefore often unnoticed, Charest has attempted to build his party's reputation as a more constructive opposition than Reform, supporting the Liberals when they think the government is right. That's led to some victories, such as persuading Martin to extend the deadline for tax deductions for charitable donations because of the postal strike, giving Canadians to the end of January for their 1997 claims.
Now Charest is going for a bigger win. He's asked the Tory Senators to hold up the Liberal increases in Canada Pension Plan premiums, hoping to wangle last-minute improvements, such as more accountability by the new CPP board of directors, or lower Employment Insurance premiums as a tradeoff.
Charest's efforts at constructive opposition haven't made him headlines.
But they are what chiefly distinguishes today's Conservatives from Reformers, and, he says, makes them more fit to be the alternative government.

Leader of `Canada's Spare Tire' Ready for the Road: [Final Edition]

Abstract: Critiquing the Liberals' handling of the run-up to the Kyoto conference on climate change, which he accurately labelled "disastrous," Mr. [Jean Charest] tossed around enough green-wonk jargon to re-establish his credentials as the party leader most comfortable with environmental issues. You can make a good argument either for heading right or for hugging the centre. On one hand, Canadians aren't used to having two big parties to the right of the Liberals, and might regard that as an unnatural state of affairs. A Tory haunted by this will go after Reform voters. On the other hand, most Liberal voters' second choice is the Conservatives. A Tory haunted by this will go after Liberals. The trouble is getting through those three or four years without sounding like the Liberals he's criticizing. On CPP reform, he says the Liberals should "at least make a commitment to reduce (employment insurance) premiums by the same amount that they're increasing CPP premiums." The Liberals have made that precise commitment for 1998. Saying, in effect, "they'd better keep it up" is not a cry that stirs the blood.

Full text: Paul Wells is the Montreal Gazette's national affairs columnist.
OTTAWA -- Jean Charest still draws far more reporters to a press conference, as leader of a party with 20 members of Parliament, than do the leaders of the 44-MP Bloc Quebecois or the 21-MP New Democratic Party. The Ottawa press gallery still cuts the Progressive Conservative leader a little slack. Not much, but some.
Commenting on the parliamentary session just ended and the rest of the mandate ahead, Mr. Charest earlier this week showed the charm that remains his greatest asset, and the command of detail that separates him from Prime Minister Jean Chretien and even Reform Leader Preston Manning.
Critiquing the Liberals' handling of the run-up to the Kyoto conference on climate change, which he accurately labelled "disastrous," Mr. Charest tossed around enough green-wonk jargon to re-establish his credentials as the party leader most comfortable with environmental issues.
The environment is a manager's portfolio, and Mr. Charest is a manager, ironically better at incremental change than at laying out the grand visions he always talks about. He thinks the new Canada Pension Plan investment fund should be open to scrutiny by the auditor-general. Excellent idea. Excellent little idea.
As he tries to bring his party back from its 1993 near-death experience, Mr. Charest must decide every day whose votes to chase: the Liberals' or the Reformers'. Given his druthers, of course, he'd rather have them both, but that's not always possible.
You can make a good argument either for heading right or for hugging the centre. On one hand, Canadians aren't used to having two big parties to the right of the Liberals, and might regard that as an unnatural state of affairs. A Tory haunted by this will go after Reform voters. On the other hand, most Liberal voters' second choice is the Conservatives. A Tory haunted by this will go after Liberals.
Mr. Charest is haunted by those Liberal votes. Somebody once called the Tories, the party voters have turned to when they can't stomach the Liberals, "Canada's spare tire."
Charest pronounces himself inflated and road-ready. "What I sense, and what I'm predicting, is that people will regain their taste -- in three, four years from now -- for gathering around a single table, rather than finding themselves in parliaments divided by region."
The trouble is getting through those three or four years without sounding like the Liberals he's criticizing. On CPP reform, he says the Liberals should "at least make a commitment to reduce (employment insurance) premiums by the same amount that they're increasing CPP premiums." The Liberals have made that precise commitment for 1998. Saying, in effect, "they'd better keep it up" is not a cry that stirs the blood.
He wants to offer "a credible alternative." Alternative to what? Often, to whatever he just said. "The latest poll shows us how much Quebecers are tired of referendums," he said. Then, on polls showing him as the best leader for the Quebec Liberals. "Well, polls, you have to take them with a grain of salt." Then, on his tax-cut policy: "Recent polling seems to indicate (Canadians) are coming around to that view."
On unity, he said, "The problem isn't in Quebec City, the problem is in Ottawa." Does that mean Canada is today threatened more gravely by its federalist prime minister than by Quebec's secessionist premier? "I don't measure it in those terms," he said.
But Ottawa must be willing "to undertake changes that everyone in this country, every provincial government, is looking forward to ... . And Mr. Chretien has had a great deal of difficulty doing that. Even when faced, as he was at the premiers' conference, with a clear will ... he has to be dragged along, screaming and kicking."
So a Prime Minister Jean Charest would drop his own position to embrace a consensus among the provinces? "I'm not saying that at all. Not at all. What I'm saying, though, is this. That it's incumbent upon me to come to the table with a plan and some objectives. Not just sit there and improvise, and make it up as you go along, from press conference to press conference."
Jean Charest is against improvising at press conferences. Got it.

Abstract: FOREST fires deliberately lit by man in many parts of the world have made 1997 the worst year in recorded history for destruction of the natural environment, a report released yesterday says. The biggest and most numerous fires were in Brazil, where they raged along a 10,000-mile front, and still burn. Second came Indonesia, where months of smog put 40,000 people in hospital. But Papua New Guinea, Colombia, Africa, Australia and southern Europe have had large areas devastated, too. Greece, Spain, Italy and France have all suffered, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report, entitled The Year the Earth Caught Fire.

Full text: FOREST fires deliberately lit by man in many parts of the world have made 1997 the worst year in recorded history for destruction of the natural environment, a report released yesterday says.
The biggest and most numerous fires were in Brazil, where they raged along a 10,000-mile front, and still burn. Second came Indonesia, where months of smog put 40,000 people in hospital.
But Papua New Guinea, Colombia, Africa, Australia and southern Europe have had large areas devastated, too. Greece, Spain, Italy and France have all suffered, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report, entitled The Year the Earth Caught Fire.
Although the droughts in the Amazon and South-east Asia caused by the change in monsoon patterns brought about by the strong El Nino in the Pacific are partially to blame, human greed is the main cause.
The breakdown of law and order in many countries has escalated the destruction. Although some countries, including Indonesia, claim that lighting fires is banned, much of the damage there is on government-funded projects.
Forest fires have always been a hazard of lightning during hot periods or drought, and in some cases they help the environment by creating clearings and healthy regeneration, the report says. But the risks are increased by human activities such as selective logging, drainage and pollution-related climate change.
Most accidental fires result from losing control of fires started for land clearance, charcoal burning and cooking. Some begin from transport and dropped cigarettes. But this year the main causes have been land clearance for farms or plantations, timber speculation, insurance crime and even vandalism.
"The widespread breakdown of the rule of law is a critical factor in fire abuse," the report says.
The data are backed by satellite information analysed by the Woods Hole Institute in the United States and Edinburgh University.
Researchers agree the destruction is continuing. Some peat fires in Indonesia are expected to burn for years. Although damped by rains, they are likely to break out again in the dry season. Some fires have been burning since 1983.
Claude Martin, director-general of WWF, said: "These fires were not an act of God. They were deliberately set, as they have been for many years, to clear forest for other purposes, and sometimes to cover up for timber poaching and land theft.
"It is also increasingly clear that the guilty parties are not just small farmers, as has been assumed, but that most of the damage is being done by plantation and timber companies. This is not just an emergency, it is a planetary disaster."
Barita Manullane, from Indonesia, where 5 million acres of forest have been lost this year, said government-sponsored rice-growing projects were chiefly to blame.
He is in charge of a project to save the orang-utan, and said the swamp forests where they survive were being drained and deliberately burned, even though it was, in his view, impossible to grow rice there.
"The peat has now caught fire and, despite the rains coming, burns on. I cannot see how they can ever put them out. Many of the animals are dead or driven from the trees by the haze."
Fires in Brazil have increased by 50 per cent on last year. Loggers, cattle farmers and peasants have taken advantage of the dry season to clear land. An average 599 new fires a day were reported, making 24,549 fires in a period of 41 days. Many fires are still burning.
In Brazil's Atlantic rain forest one of the rarest mammals in the world, the golden lion tamarind, is threatened by deliberate burning.
In Colombia there have been 7,000 forest fires, including 37 in protected areas, and 40,000 acres of national parks have been burned. Nearly all the fires were believed to have been started by man.
Papua New Guinea is suffering its worst drought for 50 years, and speculators have burned thousands of square miles of forest and grassland, leaving millions on the edge of starvation. An international relief effort is under way but loss of vegetation is expected to affect the climate adversely.
Most recently, Australia has suffered forest and scrub fires, which have penetrated the suburbs of Sydney.
Kenya's famous Imenti Forest around Mount Kenya has been burned by illegal settlers as bribed forest officials turn a blind eye. Tanzania, Senegal and the Congo have had large forest fires.
Rwanda's relic cloud forest was threatened in the Nyungwe Montane Forest Reserve, where several square miles were left burning for weeks with no attempt to put them out.
Michael Tene, an attache at the Indonesian embassy in London, said: "We regret the fires which we are trying to stop, but we do not have the means. We are not a stupid people. We want the forest but at the same time we have to feed 200 million people and so we need rice, too."

Abstract: The global warming agreement that came out of Kyoto last week is still a work in progress. Therefore, it cannot be categorized either as the environmental triumph that the Clinton-Gore team would like or the grave threat to the American economy that its opponents fear. Rather, without the signature of the United States, it is essentially a framework that will shape a national discussion the next 16 months (the treaty would have to be signed by March 1999). And that is perhaps the most positive outcome of the Kyoto conference: It has put global warming in the mainstream consciousness, beyond the hyperbole of the two extremes.

Full text: The global warming agreement that came out of Kyoto last week is still a work in progress. Therefore, it cannot be categorized either as the environmental triumph that the Clinton-Gore team would like or the grave threat to the American economy that its opponents fear.
Rather, without the signature of the United States, it is essentially a framework that will shape a national discussion the next 16 months (the treaty would have to be signed by March 1999). And that is perhaps the most positive outcome of the Kyoto conference: It has put global warming in the mainstream consciousness, beyond the hyperbole of the two extremes.
Going into the conference, President Clinton had set two central planks in America's position: a reduction of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by around 2010 and a commitment to emissions reductions by developing countries. He came away with neither.
At the nudging of Vice President Gore, the United States agreed to a 7 percent emissions cut from 1990 levels, which actually equates to more than a 35 percent cut from what Americans' emissions are projected to be in 2010. And, while giving in to greater emissions cuts, the United States still didn't get the commitment from developing countries that the Senate, by a 95-0 vote, had insisted upon in July.
So Clinton and Gore know that the Kyoto protocol would be dead on arrival at the Senate, which is why they are wise not to send it there yet. Instead, they will try to get developing countries to agree to emissions limits between now and next November, when a follow-up conference is scheduled for Buenos Aires. That is as it should be; in 1996 numbers, China is already the world's second largest carbon emitter (albeit not, of course, on a per capita basis), and it ought not be exempt from global climate-change efforts.
Clearly, until that issue is resolved, this is not an agreement to which the United States will become a signatory. But it is an issue in which Americans will now be clearly engaged -- with all of the accompanying questions regarding their unfettered burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation.
Assuming Clinton will not send the protocol to the Senate until after the Buenos Aires conference, Americans have a year to decide, as The Economist frames the issue, how much insurance they want to take out against the risk of global warming. The phenomenon exists, but the consequences are uncertain. Yet those are circumstances in which many Americans will still lean toward caution; in fact, a recent New York Times poll indicates that Americans are more willing to protect against global warming than skeptics think.
They will have to think about it more now, as Clinton is sure to engage them on it in 1998. Indeed, by compromising to keep the Kyoto conference from collapsing, the administration has permitted the domestic debate to get serious. And the future of the planet is, after all, a serious matter.

9 provinces to talk social policy
Bouchard sees negotiations as Ottawa stepping on other governments' turf
Saturday, December 13, 1997
The Globe and Mail
OTTAWA -- Ottawa and nine provinces have agreed on a new consultative process for social policy -- but immediately ran into significant disagreements on how it should be interpreted.
Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard made it clear that he was not part of the consensus, however it should be interpreted.
"It's so obvious. It's so symbolic," Mr. Bouchard said after the meeting. ". . . For the first time in the history of this country, all of the provinces, Quebec excepted, and the federal government are on the eve of concluding an agreement according to which the federal government would be allowed to step into all the jurisdictions of the provinces, despite the Constitution."
Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien and the nine other premiers agreed to start negotiating a framework agreement for Canada's social union, which they said would apply to federal, provincial and territorial governments "while respecting each other's constitutional jurisdiction and powers."
The issues to be negotiated include:
A set of principles for social policy;
What the leaders called "collaborative approaches" to the federal government's use of spending power;
Clarification of the ground rules for intergovernmental co-operation;
Identification of ways to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the different levels of government within different social-policy areas.
However, the most controversial area, which provoked immediately contradictory interpretations, was the agreement to discuss "appropriate dispute-settlement mechanisms between governments."
Several premiers made it clear that, if a dispute-settlement mechanism was agreed upon, it would apply to one of the thorniest issues of conflict: the federal government's enforcement of the Canada Health Act.
That act lays out the key principles of government-run health insurance, including accessibility and universality, which prohibit provinces from allowing doctors to charge extra fees or creating a private medical system. When provinces have challenged this, the federal government has deducted money from their health transfers.
Provincial leaders were delighted that the federal government agreed to study a dispute-mechanism process. "I think it was a very good conference," Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said.
Mr. Klein said he was particularly pleased at the agreement to enter into a framework to achieve social-policy renewal, "including something that we've been after for a long time and that is to set up a mechanism for dispute resolution."
However, while some provincial officials crowed that the federal government had agreed to discuss the Canada Health Act, federal ministers immediately sent out a contradictory message.
Mr. Chr√©tien stressed that the federal government wants to discuss the issue with the provinces, but that the Canada Health Act remains a federal law. "If somebody breaks the law, the federal government will be the government that enforces the law," he said.
In the same vein, Health Minister Allan Rock said that the Canada Health Act remains a key priority. "I think Canadians want a federal government that has the authority that ensures that the [Canada Health] Act is being respected from coast to coast to coast," said Mr. Rock. "We intend to fulfill that role."
But the premiers took a different view. "Absolutely, it is [up] for discussion," said British Columbia Premier Glen Clark. "It is on the table for discussion."
Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon and Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow both agreed that the principles of the Canada Health Act had not been challenged, but argued that its enforcement would be discussed as part of the negotiations over functions of the dispute-settlement mechanism.
Newfoundland Premier Brian Tobin argued that there was a misunderstanding that suggested there had been disagreement.
"Something incredible happened today," he said. He said there was unanimity among the premiers, including Mr. Bouchard, in recognizing that Canadians feel there is stress in the medical system, a danger of a two-tier system, and in giving a unanimous message to the Prime Minister that the health system is hurting and reinvestment is necessary.
Despite -- or perhaps because of -- the differing interpretations, both Mr. Chr√©tien and Mr. Klein were positive about the tone of the meeting.
"This was a typical Canadian meeting," Mr. Chr√©tien said. "No great flash, no fireworks, just solid progress."
He praised what he called the mood of partnership, adding: "There is no bad news to report."
Mr. Klein struck the same note. "You know, the Prime Minister was in a real listening mood," he said. "Now he's going to have the challenge of taking some of these resolutions back to his caucus and getting concurrence there, but I think the messages were very strong -- certainly the message of co-operative federalism."
At the meeting, Mr. Bouchard presented a proposal that the provinces be given the right to opt out of any social program "susceptible to having an impact in a field of provincial jurisdiction," with full financial compensation. He also wanted a federal moratorium on any such programs, and the agreement that a whole range of federal initiatives, from the improvement of the national child benefit to the Canada student-loans program, be postponed.
After the meeting, Mr. Bouchard complained that Mr. Chr√©tien had dismissed his proposal out of hand. "This is a move towards a very centralized government with provinces having no powers, no responsibilities, but to accept what the federal government will decide in terms of programs and funding," the Quebec Premier said.
Mr. Clark made it clear he disagreed with Mr. Bouchard's interpretation. "In fact, the purpose of the framework agreement is to stop the federal government from unilateral action in provincial jurisdiction, but to work together to set national standards as opposed to federal standards," he said.
In addition to the agreement to discuss a framework for Canada's social union, Ottawa and nine premiers reaffirmed their commitment to launch a national child-benefit system by July 1, a national children's agenda, a framework for co-operation on policies dealing with the disabled and a youth-employment action plan, and to make the issue of youth employment a national priority.
All of the leaders, including Mr. Bouchard, agreed on the importance of attacking the problem of student debt, and agreed that Finance Minister Paul Martin and Human Resources Development Minister Pierre Pettigrew should consult with provincial education ministers so that Mr. Martin can address the problem in his next budget.
There was also unanimous agreement on a consultative process on climate change that will look at the consequences of the Kyoto protocol before it is ratified.

Full text: EARLY yesterday morning the world's top environmental campaigners on climate change were out on the town in Kyoto, drinking and dancing to the tune of a new world order.
As they progressed from the Pig and Whistle British-style pub, to the seedy Bar Isn't It?, to the tiny Bar Six-and-a-Half, they outlined their view of what comes after the climate change treaty.
In Australia, America and around the world there will be massive attention paid to the implications of implementing a global reduction of the greenhouse gas pollutants that cause global warming. These will include harm to fossil fuel industries, especially coal, of which Australia has 100 billion tonnes still to be dug up.
But domestic laws to make vehicles more fuel-efficient can reduce dependency on oil imports, and promote natural gas use - of which Australia also has a lot.
And less greenhouse gas emission from vehicles has the double benefit of less air pollution in cities.
Building codes will demand greater energy efficiency to save on emissions from power generation, but this also means financial savings.
Huge impetus will be added to the development of solar and other renewable energy technologies such as wind. And institutional investors such as the giant insurance companies will increasingly judge the environmental soundness and technologies of companies in their portfolios.
Stopping the bulldozers and tree-poisoners in the Australian bush can bring great reductions of carbon dioxide, the chief villain among the six greenhouse gases.
All this is happening already and will speed up. But the treaty itself is unlikely to be fully enforced for about four years. It requires progress on cutting emissions by 2005 and cuts from most nations by 2012.
Some form of carbon tax to drive trading of emissions within countries and internationally is likely, because this would allow the free market to drive sometimes costly and unpopular changes to the way people live, rather than politicians.
Australia, controversially to many, is allowed to increase by 8 per cent of the 1990 baseline.
The fairness of this may face challenges later, and may bring pressure for Australia to do more as leaders in countries such as the United States and Canada struggle to explain to voters why they have to accept much harder targets than Australians.
One concern is that in a world where clean energy is king, Australia will not be under enough pressure to improve its technology.

Slow but steady progress made on environmental issues The outcome of the Climate Change Summit was a small but significant step for mankind, writes Frank McDonald in Kyoto: [CITY EDITION]

Abstract: On the face of it, the target for greenhouse gas reductions agreed in Kyoto this week seem paltry, even pathetic. But the really important thing about the world's first treaty on climate change is that it moves the whole process decisively in the right direction.

Full text: On the face of it, the target for greenhouse gas reductions agreed in Kyoto this week seem paltry, even pathetic. But the really important thing about the world's first treaty on climate change is that it moves the whole process decisively in the right direction.
Extracting the required concessions from some of the participating countries, notably the United States and Japan, was not unlike a long-drawn-out dental appointment, with a lot of pain and even some blood on the floor, though the European Union proved to be quite a good dentist.
They had come to Kyoto offering little (Japan) or nothing (the US). But by the time they left after the final round of all-night negotiations both countries had agreed to the Protocol and pledged to cut the greenhouse gas emissions.
The EU had won considerable kudos by offering to reduce its overall emissions by 15 per cent on 1990 levels by the year 2010. But it was clear from the outset that its major industrial competitors were never going to come close to matching this ambitious target. A diplomatic compromise was inevitable. In the end, the figures agreed in their tripartite talks worked out at 8 per cent for the EU, 7 per cent for the US and 6 per cent for Japan, all to be achieved over a four-year period from 2008 to 2012. The industrialised world as a whole also signed up to an overall cut of 5.2 per cent.
The US is livid that one of its key conditions, "meaningful participation" by key developing countries, had to be dropped in the face of implacable opposition from China and India. Indeed, only the fear of being blamed for a failure in Kyoto kept the Clinton administration on board.
The G77 Group, which represents 136 developing countries, insisted that the industrialised nations must be the first to take action on the issue, since it was their emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which had caused the problem of climate change in the first place. At stake was the issue of "global equity" as G77 sees it. Though emissions from China, India and other major developing countries are rising fast and will ultimately outstrip those from the industrialised world, they remain very low on a per-capita basis, by factors of up to 20 to one.
The US, with only 5 per cent of the world's population, is the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, accounting for nearly 25 per cent of the global total. If it did not agree to make real cuts, there would be no chance whatsoever of persuading the developing world to sign up, even on a voluntary basis. President Clinton was kept under relentless pressure by the mis-named Global Climate Coalition (GCC), which primarily represents US oil, coal and motor manufacturing interests. It set out to ensure that the Kyoto summit would end in failure or, at least, in the realm of meaningless declarations.
The Exxon Oil Company, one of the GCC's leading members, was to the fore in pressing the US administration to insist that the developing countries were stitched into any deal in Kyoto. At the same time, it was calling on them to increase their own consumption of oil to promote economic growth. By far the most hysterical statement issued during the 10-day summit came from the GCC itself. It claimed that the agreement amounted to "unilateral economic disarmament" by the US that would throw three million Americans on to the dole queue and cost the economy $150 billion a year.
Such assertions are regarded as quite outlandish by environmental groups and by the European Union.
Of course, because the Kyoto summit decided on lower greenhouse gas reduction targets, the EU's famous "bubble" will have to be renegotiated. But the danger here is that its 15 member-states, including Ireland, would be allocated lower targets, thus undermining Europe's high moral ground. This would be a great mistake, not least because of the message it would send the key developing countries such as China. Mr John Prescott, Britain's Deputy Prime Minister, has already reaffirmed its intention of sticking by its original targets and there is no reason why Ireland can't do the same. There are all sorts of "win-win" measures which can be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as serious energy conservation, investment in alternative energy sources, more fuel efficient vehicles and most of all the imposition of a "carbon tax' to shift the burden from PRSI.
Internationally, the primary task between now and the fourth Climate Change Summit in Beunos Aires next November will be to iron out the details of such US-inspired initiatives as "emissions trading" to ensure that these are not used to avoid action to curb greenhouse gases on the home front. As for those who discount the whole thesis of climate change, the meteorological data for Kyoto tell their own story. A century ago, the city had 100 days of frost every winter; now it has 15 and there are still roses in full bloom and bright red leaves on the Japanese maples in mid-December.
In November one of the world's leading insurance companies, Munich Re, warned that the potential losses from an extreme natural catastrophe affecting one of the planet's major cities or industrial centres might "bring about the collapse of the world's financial markets".
The most memorable speech at the Kyoto summit was delivered by Mr Kinza Clodumar, president of the Polynesian Republic of Nauru. Like other low-lying small island states, Nauru is threatened with extinction, and its President talked movingly about how his people were now "trapped" between an interior devastated by colonial phosphate mining and the prospect of "a terrifying flood of biblical proportions" due to rising sea levels. "The wilful destruction of entire countries and cultures with foreknowledge would represent an unspeakable crime against humanity," he declared. "No nation has the right to place its own misconstrued national interest before the physical and cultural survival of whole countries."
In this context, the Kyoto Protocol may be seen as a squalid formulation of the lowest common denominator. But at least it indicates that world leaders are at last prepared to face up to the powerful fossil-fuel lobby and start dealing with this truly overwhelming environmental issue.

Abstract: Never mind that it took a sideswipe from the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, to spur the IPE into action. And never mind that the IPE could be pushed aside by US markets, which already have experience of trading emissions permits. At least the exchange is interested and is preparing to tell the Government how it would operate such a market. The prospects range from financing environmental industries to reporting on green performance. They affect just about every City institution and activity from corporate finance to equity analysis, risk management and investment. So far, institutions have tended to react only to green threats, rather than opportunities. Thus the insurance industry is more advanced than most on environmental issues because it stands to lose out from unusual weather and climatic catastrophes. In other sectors it has proved difficult to raise enthusiasm. Accountants have tried to develop environmental reporting but,in the absence of any statutory requirement, this has had limited success. Analysts have been reluctant to factor in liabilities from problems such as contaminated land to their assessments of share prices, mainly because of the time scales involved in such liabilities. And they have been sceptical about the potential for green products and processes because of doubts about the sustainability, as it were, of consumer interest and the seriousness of governments' positions.

Full text: AT LEAST one part of the City seems to have finally awakened to the environmental challenge, with the International Petroleum Exchange saying that it is interested in running a market for tradeable pollution permits.
Never mind that it took a sideswipe from the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, to spur the IPE into action. And never mind that the IPE could be pushed aside by US markets, which already have experience of trading emissions permits. At least the exchange is interested and is preparing to tell the Government how it would operate such a market.
The question is how long it will take the rest of the City to catch on to the many green opportunities arising from Kyoto and elsewhere.
The prospects range from financing environmental industries to reporting on green performance. They affect just about every City institution and activity from corporate finance to equity analysis, risk management and investment. So far, institutions have tended to react only to green threats, rather than opportunities. Thus the insurance industry is more advanced than most on environmental issues because it stands to lose out from unusual weather and climatic catastrophes.
In other sectors it has proved difficult to raise enthusiasm. Accountants have tried to develop environmental reporting but,in the absence of any statutory requirement, this has had limited success. Analysts have been reluctant to factor in liabilities from problems such as contaminated land to their assessments of share prices, mainly because of the time scales involved in such liabilities. And they have been sceptical about the potential for green products and processes because of doubts about the sustainability, as it were, of consumer interest and the seriousness of governments' positions.
Beyond the City, the business world has been less sceptical, although action has tended to be concentrated in a handful of leading companies, such as B&Q.
Prompted by the last green summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, many companies have now begun to understand their environmental impact and the opportunities, as well as dangers, which might emerge from action to combat climate change and resource wastefulness. It is to be hoped Kyoto will have the same effect on financial institutions as Rio had on industrial and commercial businesses.
Cheap frills ironed out in share options
THE attempt by the Institute of Directors to flaunt the modesty of its members' pay rises served again to draw attention to the importance of lucrative frills in addition to their basic packages.
So it is heartening to learn from pay expert David Tankel of New Bridge Street Consultants that the option plan for employees, which supermarkets group Safeway is installing, seemslikely to be adopted much more widely.
Mr Tankel, who advises many FTSE-listed companies, says all-employee options will continue to spread, acting as mechanisms to reward individual performance, enhance employee share-ownership in Britain and overseas or to mark a corporate milestone.
Now Safeway, again tipped as being in the line of predatory fire, may have its own reasons for trying to shore up employee loyalty. It may also believe that introducing options that depend on improving "customer care" will offer longer-term protection if speculation evaporates.
The supermarkets group is not the first to introduce executive-style options on the shop floor. Asda, which will next week report profits of pounds 180 million and is seen as having a rekindled interest in Safeway, rewarded staff with options as part of Archie Norman's transformation of the company.
Other proponents include Glaxo Wellcome, the drugs group, Abbey National and advertising agency WPP.
But Mr Tankel comments: "Safeway's plan is innovative because it emphasises and supports the company's focus on customer-care performance. Given the imminent demise of tax relief for profit-related pay, this approach may well have wider applications."
Although all full-time staff were given options to launch the plan, future awards will rely on the annual customer-care performance of the store in which they work.
"Employees will be rewarded directly for their efforts as well as focusing on the group's share-price performance after the options are granted. Because options normally lapse if employees leave, the plan should help to reduce staff turnover levels," says Mr Tankel.
Options have the same advantages for staff as for the board. People do not have to save to amass them as with share-save schemes, which also have little appeal for overseas workers. Options are easier to administer, and if there are problems in giving shares to workers abroad, phantom options can be used, the profits from which can be given as a bonus.
As Mr Tankel points out, one drawback is that options can be exercised only once every three years. This, he says, made sense when options worth four times salary could be awarded, but is less convincing now the maximim grant is pounds 30,000.
The Employee Share Ownership Centre and Proshare have already started to lobby the Government for greater flexibility. Options could start to compensate for the chasm between the top and the bottom of businesses' reward structures.
How to stop the chips going down
AS IF the substantially underestimated impact on stock markets from the Asian economic meltdown were not bad enough for investors, the potentially horrendous consequences stemming from the computer "millennium bug" are adding to an air of potentially fatal unreality.
Some of the largest fund managers are beginning to wonder out loud whether the companies in which they invest are taking these enormous risks seriously enough.
And an atmosphere of panic is beginning to develop as headhunters engulf anyone with the technology skills necessary to protect computer systems from the crash that threatens when the midnight hour passes in two years' time.
But now, the Institute of Chartered Accountants has published proposals that could alleviate some of the mystery. The ICA wants companies to include statements of "business risk", which would identify important problem areas, such as the possibility of the closure of an entire operation because of a computer failure, and describe action being taken to manage those risks. Importantly, the accountants want companies to include the potential for gain, rather than just the exposure to loss.
The Securities and Exchange Commission in the US has already released its requirements for the disclosure of risks relating to the millennium problem and the Accounting Standards Board is expected to publish recommendations early in the New Year about how British firms should treat the costs associated with upgrading their computer systems.
Rightly, though, the accountants say the thirst for knowledge about companies' exposure to risks, which might also include environmental issues (see above) and ethical sourcing, should not be limited only to the cash implications.
The Guardian is planning to launch a column which will hold utility firms and monopoly businesses to account on the behalf of consumers.

Big U.S. Industries Launch Attack on Warming Treaty --- Big Three Auto Companies, Steelmakers, Utilities Are Leading the Charge

Full text: Promptly and predictably, some of the biggest players in American industry have come out swinging against the proposed new treaty to limit global warming.
Auto companies, utilities and steel manufacturers all forecast dire consequences if the agreement, reached in marathon negotiations in Kyoto, Japan, is put into effect. Even the reaction from the insurance industry, which has looked more favorably on the idea of a global-warming treaty in the past, was lukewarm.
The response isn't a surprise; many of the sentiments expressed have been voiced repeatedly. And both government officials and environmental groups discount some of the industry complaints, maintaining that U.S. businesses could make the kinds of reductions in greenhouse gases the treaty envisions through better use of new environmentally friendly technologies.
But the immediate reaction from the business community gives some sense of the obstacles the Clinton administration faces in trying to win Senate ratification of the agreement -- and of the kind of support Republican congressional leaders can expect if they try to block the deal.
Under the agreement reached in Kyoto, the U.S. would commit to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases it emits to a level 7% below its 1990 emissions. The goal would have to be reached between the years 2008 and 2012. The European Union would pledge to cut its emissions by 8%, Japan by 6%.
Greenhouse gases are produced in large measure by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, which means that utilities, cars and coal-burning manufacturing plants all would be sources of the reductions. U.S. auto makers, who feel they have as much at stake as anybody in the global-warming debate, were sharply critical of the agreement.
"For months, we have urged the administration not to bind this country to reductions of greenhouse-gas emissions with arbitrary deadlines," Chrysler Corp. Chairman Robert J. Eaton said. "Innovation and invention don't often come with dates certain. The administration chose to do that anyway."
Ford Motor Co. Chairman Alex Trotman denounced the treaty and, like other business leaders, was particularly critical of the fact that it doesn't demand specific reductions of greenhouse gases by developing countries. "Since the protocol has targets for developed nations but no commitment from developing nations, it won't work," he said.
What the industry fears is that the pact's emissions standards will force the creation of more-stringent U.S. fuel-economy requirements to reduce gasoline use. That is a problem, because such requirements would essentially call for the production of more small cars, which aren't as popular with American car buyers or as profitable for auto makers as bigger, heavier-polluting pickups, sport-utility vehicles and vans.
"If they put a deadline on new technology development, it could force us to use what [technology] we have and balance the rest of our vehicle fleets with small cars," a Chrysler spokeswoman said. And John Middlebrook, the head of General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet division, said he sees little consumer demand for smaller cars that emit less pollution. "With gasoline prices where they are in this country today, people are just not driven to buy fuel-efficient products," he said.
Similarly, representatives of the U.S. steel industry said the agreement would be what one called "a huge economic blunder" that would result in "monumental" costs to their industry.
Andrew Sharkey, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, the industry's main trade association, said the pact would benefit "rival steel industries in developing nations that have refused to participate [in reducing emissions], such as China, India and South Korea." Mr. Sharkey said the pact would "devastate" the U.S. steel industry without reducing world-wide energy-related emissions, because steel production would be shifted to other nations.
The nation's largest steelmaker, the U.S. Steel Group of USX Corp., echoed that position, with a spokesman saying, "We would oppose any agreement that doesn't include developing nations, as that would put us in a competitive disadvantage."
Aluminum companies also were critical. A spokesman for Kaiser Aluminum Corp., which is 63%-controlled by Maxxam Inc., said passage of such a treaty would hurt its ability to compete against foreign producers. "Another concern is whether the assumptions underlying the treaty are well founded in science," he said.
The treaty left oil companies, often looked to as a main culprit in greenhouse-gas emissions, hoping the president would "keep his word" and not pass the treaty on to the Senate. "He's on the record as saying he won't approve it if important criteria involving developing countries and potential adverse effects on the economy aren't met," said Red Cavaney, president of the American Petroleum Institute. The administration said yesterday it wouldn't send the treaty to the Senate until after a follow-up summit in Buenos Aires in November 1998.
Mr. Cavaney noted that any treaty approved without those criteria could force oil companies, as well as other industries with high energy costs, to move plants and jobs to countries not laboring under emissions-reduction requirements.
He also said the industry is concerned about unrealistic expectations on the technology front. "From an oil perspective, the technology is neither known nor available to provide and satisfy the current energy demand and get the kind of reductions that are being discussed." He said the treaty in its current form will force the government either to step in and ration energy, "which means less energy for everyone," or "dramatically and artificially" raise prices through taxes.
In the utility industry and elsewhere, some leaders urged the Clinton administration to rely more heavily on voluntary programs to reduce greenhouse gases rather than move toward the mandatory reductions envisioned by the Kyoto pact.
"We're very concerned about this," said W. Robert Woodall, vice president of environmental policy for Atlanta-based Southern Co. "We're the largest coal-fired producer of electricity in the country. We have already made plans to reduce emissions with voluntary programs. We had high hopes for the voluntary programs." With 75% of its power generated by coalfired plants, Southern could be severely hurt by the proposed treaty, he said.
Similarly, Thomas Kuhn, president of the Washington-based Edison Electric Institute, called the agreement "economic suicide." He said it would cost electricity utilities that have coal-fired generating facilities as much as $30 billion by some estimates to reduce emissions to the levels of 1990.
Within the insurance industry, global warming has been an increasingly hot topic of debate. Some insurers, especially those who are large sellers of homeowner policies in hurricane-prone regions of the country, think they might benefit from a global effort to reduce climate changes, which could lead to more extreme weather swings.
But support for a treaty is lackluster, industry experts say, because some fear that it would put a damper on economic growth in the U.S.
"The theory of climate change seems to make some sense, but there seems to be a serious lack of data supporting that theory," said John Arlington, assistant vice president for federal affairs for the American Insurance Association, a trade association of some of the nation's largest property-casualty insurance carriers.
Forest-products companies also might stand to benefit from a push to cut greenhouse gases, because one possible approach is to plant more trees, which soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. But the industry has adopted a wait-and-see stance.
"There's still a great deal of vagueness, and many of the details may not be worked out before" the conference next fall in Argentina, said W. Henson Moore, chairman and chief executive officer of the American Forest and Paper Association.
Rick Holley, chief executive officer at Plum Creek Timber LP, said the company supports the notion of decreasing emissions, but is concerned about the treaty's apparent absence of emission caps for developing countries such as China. Mr. Holley also expressed hope that timber companies would get "pollution credits" for the fact that trees absorb carbon. "Our industry plants millions of trees a year, and we should get credit in any pollution trading arrangement for that," he said.
Meantime, makers of grain-derived ethanol fuel think the global-warming pact will lift their business. Raymond Friend, president of High Plains Corp., said the pact helps to make ethanol a more attractive alternative for automobile fuel than petroleum. High Plains isn't drawing up expansion plans yet, however. "We're optimistic. But we'll wait to see how demand shapes up," Mr. Friend said.

Abstract: By Judith Lavoie Times Colonist staff Dismal returns of coho salmon on the East Coast of Vancouver Island are bringing calls for a ban on sports fishing for Georgia Basin coho. Department of Fisheries and Oceans spokesmen say they do not have enough data yet to consider banning retention of coho by sports fishermen. However, a plan that would allow only hatchery fish to be retained in 1999 is under review. The Goldstream Hatchery is one of the hardest hit areas andhatchery manager Peter McCully said the few fish which have returned are undersized. Climate change and ocean survival are believed to be at the root of the coho collapse, but exact reasons have not been pinpointed. Georgia Basin coho returns were expected to be poor this year. There was no commercial coho fishery, although some were caught as bycatch.

Full text: By Judith Lavoie Times Colonist staff Dismal returns of coho salmon on the East Coast of Vancouver Island are bringing calls for a ban on sports fishing for Georgia Basin coho. Department of Fisheries and Oceans spokesmen say they do not have enough data yet to consider banning retention of coho by sports fishermen. However, a plan that would allow only hatchery fish to be retained in 1999 is under review. The Goldstream Hatchery is one of the hardest hit areas andhatchery manager Peter McCully said the few fish which have returned are undersized.
"We are looking at about one-tenth of what we expected. Probably less than 300 coho showed up," he said. "It's devastating for the volunteers and we don't have any answers, which is even more distressing."
Climate change and ocean survival are believed to be at the root of the coho collapse, but exact reasons have not been pinpointed. Georgia Basin coho returns were expected to be poor this year. There was no commercial coho fishery, although some were caught as bycatch.
But there was a significant sports fishery coho harvest, and closing it down next year could make a difference, McCully said.
Although coho have been the backbone of sports fishing on Vancouver Island, they could be replaced by chinook, he suggested.
Ron Kadowaki, DFO head of south coast salmon stock assessment, said coho returns were very poor in Cowichan and Black Creek, and the 20,000 returns at Big Qualicum Hatchery were the only survivors of one million fish released.
"It's not a good situation for the East Coast of Vancouver Island and it doesn't look good for the next few years. We're going to have to be very careful with coho," he said.
There will be intense scrutiny of the situation this winter, Kadowaki said.
"Drastic measures were taken in 1997. Whether they were enough is something for this winter's consultations."
Paul Sprout, DFO operations branch director, said hatcheries have already started clipping coho fins, so a program to allow retention of hatchery fish only could start in 1999.
"Whether we do it or not remains to be seen, but it's an insurance policy if there are significant conservation problems with coho," he said.
Some technical problems need ironing out and there would be public consultations before the program could start, he said.
Until all figures have been analysed there can be no speculation about sports fishing bans, he said.
Bob Rogerson of the Amalgamated Conservation Society said sports fishermen would give up catching coho grudgingly.
Although it could be reluctantly accepted on southern Vancouver Island it would cause huge problems for the tourist industry up- Island, he said.
Over the decades the major problem has been the net fishery in Juan de Fuca Strait, but DFO did not take any action until there was a crisis - despite complaints from sports fishermen, Rogerson said.
"The coho have been mismanaged for 40 years and it can be laid directly on the doorstep of the net fishery," he said.
Even without a direct coho commercial fishery there is a problem with the fish ending up as bycatch, he said.

Abstract: FROM a Mitsubishi plant that processes rain forest logs in the Amazon and Tokyo, to polluting Chevron oil refineries in California and elsewhere, the world environment is taking a beating from corporate globalization. In a new book, "The Corporate Planet," author Joshua Karliner says corporations are using free trade agreements and World Bank loans to build a world order where they are accountable only to themselves. "Transnational corporations continue to speed the planet full throttle down a socially and ecologically unsustainable course while whistling a tune of change," says Karliner, executive director of the Transnational Resource and Action Centre in San Francisco.

Full text: ¬† FROM a Mitsubishi plant that processes rain forest logs in the Amazon and Tokyo, to polluting Chevron oil refineries in California and elsewhere, the world environment is taking a beating from corporate globalization.
In a new book, "The Corporate Planet," author Joshua Karliner says corporations are using free trade agreements and World Bank loans to build a world order where they are accountable only to themselves.
Moreover, he says, corporations are working to undermine international environmental agreements, such as the global warming treaty, being debated this week in Kyoto, Japan.
"Transnational corporations continue to speed the planet full throttle down a socially and ecologically unsustainable course while whistling a tune of change," says Karliner, executive director of the Transnational Resource and Action Centre in San Francisco.
In his book, Karliner traces the history of the Chevron Corp as a classic example of a US multinational corporation -- from its oil origins in California to its operations in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Although Chevron carries out environmental audits of its international operations, it is not clear what these audits have revealed, Karliner says. He maintains Chevron does not present any information about air emissions, hazardous waste or oil spills in its environmental report.
Karliner uses the Mitsubishi Group as an example of the "rise, worldwide growth and environmental impact of Japanese corporate power."
The more than 160 transnational corporations that make up the Mitsubishi Group range from chemical industries to oil, paper, wood, food, life insurance and industrial equipment. Karliner shows how Mitsubishi's logging practices are responsible for deforestation in the Amazon Basin and Southeast Asia.
The book also describes how, under free trade agreements, environmental regulations are often seen as getting in the way of the bottom line. "In their quest to maximize profits, transnationals have played a central role in shaping and promoting free trade agreements," says Karliner.
The free trade agreements are designed to protect multinationals, and tend to portray environmental regulations and labour laws as "barriers to free trade."
In India, for example, a number of environmental laws are being rolled back as growing foreign investment rolls in under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization.
Prohibitions against putting industrial plants in ecologically sensitive zones have been eliminated. Similarly, forestry regulations appear to have been loosened for the pulp and paper industry and mining laws watered down by mining corporations.
The book also says corporations "greenwash" the public. "Corporations have fabricated an elaborate series of green veils through which they cloud their responsibility for some of the most destructive activity ever unleashed upon the world," he adds. In advertising campaigns and other public relations strategies, many transnationals distort the truth, says the book.
The greatest doubt that global warming exists and is caused by fossil fuel emissions, for example, comes from those corporations that profit from such fuel -- oil companies, vehicle manufacturers and other industries. Most scientists agree that these emissions will cause more storms, rising sea levels and increases in floods and droughts.
In September 1997 a coalition of industry groups in the US launched a multi-million-dollar ad campaign against the United Nations climate change treaty, which aims to reduce emissions that cause global warming. Industry groups say reducing emissions will harm the US economy.
"Such greenwashing, or corporate environmental propaganda, distorts how we understand the nature of the environmental crisis," says the book.

Abstract: Earth needs a greenhouse effect, as we have reminded readers for years, if it isn't to go the way of frigid Mars. The challenge is to help the upper atmosphere trap just the Goldilocks-right amount of sun warmth. Not too hot, not too cold. 'Greenhouse' negotiators in Kyoto faced the hugely difficult task of deciding who pays what premiums for a workable insurance policy against a potentially too warm world 50 to 100 years hence. They tried to put teeth into the broad pledges made five years ago in Rio.

Full text: ¬† Earth needs a greenhouse effect, as we have reminded readers for years, if it isn't to go the way of frigid Mars. The challenge is to help the upper atmosphere trap just the Goldilocks-right amount of sun warmth. Not too hot, not too cold.
'Greenhouse' negotiators in Kyoto faced the hugely difficult task of deciding who pays what premiums for a workable insurance policy against a potentially too warm world 50 to 100 years hence. They tried to put teeth into the broad pledges made five years ago in Rio.
It should be noted that Kyoto was only one more step toward such teeth. Ratifications and detailed national programs are the next, by no means certain, step.
Before environmentalists, industrialists, labor, thermostat pushers, and the motoring public themselves become overheated in coming debates, remember that, even without teeth, efforts to cut greenhouse-gas emissions are already well under way.
Climate scientists are speeding research on the still-uncertain cause-effect systems influencing climate change. Major global firms (British Petroleum, Norsk Hydro, Ford, Honda, Toyota, Asea Brown Boveri, Daimler Benz, Dupont, and many North American utilities) are spending hundreds of millions on research. They are developing car engines with exhaust cleaner than their intake air, fuel-cell motors and heating systems, more cost-effective photovoltaic roofing, and pollution-swallowing manufacturing processes.
We continue to believe that governments can best move this effort along by four means: (1) Creating tax incentives for emission-related business research. (2) Funding university research and its flow to businesses. (3) Quickly cutting trade barriers on environmental equipment. (4) Negotiating a global system for tradable emissions credits to help even out different national fuel dependencies and transport needs.

Premiers wonder which Chr√©tien they'll face this time
As first ministers gather in Ottawa, they know only that the federal government is anxious to be a player again
Tuesday, December 9, 1997
Parliamentary Bureau Chief
OTTAWA -- Canada's premiers are making the pilgrimage to the nation's capital this week hoping to break bread with the province-friendly Liberals of a year ago and braced for a return of the bossy feds of old.
The suspense in this week's meeting of first ministers boils down to this: Did the brief era of federal-provincial good will ushered in with the February, 1996, Speech from the Throne screech to a halt with the Chr√©tien government's we-are-back Throne Speech this fall?
The September speech was a millennial blueprint in which the Liberals set forth their hopes to expand government-run health insurance into drugs and home care and the Prime Minister personally declared his intention to create a multibillion-dollar scholarship fund for postsecondary students.
For the premiers, it was a bit much to swallow. In the name of deficit reduction, they have weathered severe cutbacks in federal transfer payments for health care and education. Suddenly, here were the Liberals striking a heroic stance as they outlined their plans for the postdeficit age -- with the action to take place on terrain the Constitution deems provincial.
Like so much in federal-provincial relations, it all comes down to money. More specifically, to who gets to call the shots on the so-called fiscal dividend -- the billions of dollars in surpluses Ottawa is projected to begin racking up next year. The Chr√©tien Liberals seem bound and determined to go over the heads of the provinces and design programs in which the federal government communes with individual Canadians. That means, for instance, plowing money into federal scholarships rather than handing it to the provinces directly.
The premiers view the case of health as even more egregious. At their annual meeting in August, they told Ottawa that they expect the first returns from the fiscal dividend to be restoration of the social transfers the federal government slashed in fighting its deficit over the past four years, and that goes well beyond the promise reiterated yesterday to establish a $12.5-billion cash floor for social transfers.
The premiers say that nobody contributed more to deficit reduction than the provinces, which sustained reductions of more than $6-billion in federal transfers. Ottawa, using a different method of calculation, claims that it cut its own programs far more deeply.
There is no doubt that the federal government wants to be a player again after a period in which its fiscal weakness and postreferendum morosity caused it to pull in its horns in areas ranging from environmental regulation to job training to social housing.
Last week, a Liberal-dominated Commons committee dumped on the environmental harmonization accord with the provinces. The transfer of federal housing stock still is incomplete. And while many provinces have signed labour-market agreements with Ottawa, the Ontario-dominated Liberal caucus has made it clear to Human Resources Minister Pierre Pettigrew that an agreement with the Harris government would be tantamount to a deal with the devil.
Mr. Pettigrew himself prefers to stress other matters. He points to his impressive but still incomplete deal with the provinces to create a new national child benefit as proof that a new mood still prevails.
"I think first ministers will be taking stock of more remarkable progress than they probably expected in June, 1996, when they tasked their social services ministers to make progress on children. There will certainly be cause for celebration there of pretty substantial progress."
But the premiers, in the words of one senior adviser, "will be waiting with bated breath" to see whether these are the February, 1996, Liberals or the September, 1997, Liberals. Alberta's Ralph Klein has been grumbling in the leadup to the meeting about federal officials trying to stage-manage the event to suit their own agenda.
The provinces come to this meeting feeling that they've come through for the Prime Minister on Quebec. The Calgary declaration of September, which is now being subjected to low-key public consultations in nine provinces and two territories, is meant to put something in the shop window for federalists as Quebec heads toward a provincial election and perhaps another referendum.
In return for taking a chance on reopening the messy issue of distinct society for Quebec (now rechristened unique character), the premiers demanded this meeting to deal with what Saskatchewan's Roy Romanow likes to call the other 80 per cent of the national-unity equation -- the nuts and bolts of federal and provincial programs.
"The provinces extended their hands to Ottawa as much as to Quebec with the Calgary accord," remarked an official from a Western province. Now it is time to see if that politeness is returned.
The assertive tone of the September Throne Speech has doubled the determination of provinces like Ontario and Alberta to push for what they call a framework agreement, in essence a set of rules to restrict Ottawa wandering at will into provincial territory. In its 1996 Throne Speech, Ottawa volunteered to restrict the use of the so-called spending power by which it has in the past powered its way into social programming.
But this well-publicized renunciation of the spending power is non-binding and purposely littered with loopholes. Ontario and Alberta would like to start closing these off (although Ontario's Mike Harris, in particular, must be mindful that his population supports a large role for Ottawa in social policy).
Mr. Klein is burned at Ottawa for supposedly reneging on its agreement with the provinces over climate change.
Any attempts to gang up on the federal government must overcome the fact that the provinces suffer from a lack of cohesion over their vision for Ottawa's future role. While they share a sense of anger at the cuts imposed on them, the smaller provinces view the federal government as more of a protector than intruder in their affairs. Moreover, two of the dominant voices at the table -- by dint of personality more than size -- belong to leaders of small provinces, Saskatchewan's Roy Romanow and Newfoundland's Brian Tobin.
Nor does Jean Chr√©tien, who would rather be golfing in a rainstorm than supping with the premiers in any case, want the meeting to turn into an effort by the Lilliputian provinces to tie down the federal Gulliver. He hopes to script instead an outpouring of mutual self-congratulations over the co-operative spirit the two levels of government have so far displayed in designing the national child benefit, which is to go into effect in July.
He will seek to repeat the trick -- this time in the area of youth unemployment. After their annual meeting in August, the premiers said Ottawa should get out of youth programs and hand the money it spends over to them. Mr. Chr√©tien told them no. Now it looks as if the first ministers will jointly instruct Mr. Pettigrew and his provincial counterparts to sit down and design a common approach to the issue.
Even though he is one of the most provincially oriented ministers in Ottawa, Mr. Pettigrew draws the line at youth.
"I agree that we should eliminate duplication. We should work more in partnership. But you cannot demand simply that the government of Canada sends a cheque to the provinces and disappears from the map altogether."
The toughest debate will revolve around health care despite the premeeting move to end the era of cuts. The provinces want Ottawa to put money back into health transfers and to allow for some form of joint interpretation of the Canada Health Act. Whatever their ideoogical stripe, the premiers resent that Ottawa acts as judge and jury on infractions of the principles of medicare even though it now contributes just a fraction of the money in the system.
The Chr√©tien government doesn't want to give much ground on either point. It has been talking internally about more transparent rules around medicare, but it has no intention of surrendering the hammer. As for the transfers, it prefers to find more visible ways than sending a cheque to the provinces to remind Canadians of its nurturing role in health care.
Thus the discussion in Ottawa about expanding medicare into new areas such as drug coverage and home care.
The provinces counter that medicare needs to be fixed before it is expanded. "The biggest threat to medicare in the last 10 years is this government and its cuts to transfers," said one provincial official. There is nothing wrong with studying joint action on drugs and home care, he added, so long as the funding of the current system is addressed first.

Vice President Al Gore announced in Kyoto he was giving American negotiators unspecified "increased flexibility" in a standoff with Europe over how deeply to cut emissions. Negotiators had plunged into final talks aimed at strengthening the 1992 Climate Change Treaty by setting legally binding targets for reducing industrial nations' emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global warming. Gore also said the Clinton administration would fight to override any Senate opposition to a treaty back home.
But even if the U.S.-European differences are bridged, the U.S. is still trying to win commitments by developing countries to limit emissions.

Abstract: The international climate-change treaty negotiations in Kyoto offer the chance to prevent, at surprisingly low cost, a global warming scenario that might otherwise prove extremely expensive. Unfortunately, the career naysayers will attempt to confuse the debate, while companies that neither challenge nor support the scientific foundations for near-term action could waste a tremendous opportunity to stimulate realistic climate solutions. Since, for most companies, control of greenhouse gas emissions is not an important issue, incremental and flexible regulatory programs would have negligible near-term impacts on the U.S. economy. Exports, for example, would suffer little, because of their relatively small energy component and the likelihood that energy prices will not increase significantly. Additionally, the cost of carbon reductions will decline as mass production meets the growing domestic and overseas market for ``green'' technologies. According to the Alliance to Save Energy, smart regulatory programs could even create as many as 800,000 new jobs.

Full text: The international climate-change treaty negotiations in Kyoto offer the chance to prevent, at surprisingly low cost, a global warming scenario that might otherwise prove extremely expensive. Unfortunately, the career naysayers will attempt to confuse the debate, while companies that neither challenge nor support the scientific foundations for near-term action could waste a tremendous opportunity to stimulate realistic climate solutions.
Since, for most companies, control of greenhouse gas emissions is not an important issue, incremental and flexible regulatory programs would have negligible near-term impacts on the U.S. economy. Exports, for example, would suffer little, because of their relatively small energy component and the likelihood that energy prices will not increase significantly.
Additionally, the cost of carbon reductions will decline as mass production meets the growing domestic and overseas market for ``green'' technologies. According to the Alliance to Save Energy, smart regulatory programs could even create as many as 800,000 new jobs.
There are three reasons why regulatory action is warranted.
First, the science -- although not conclusive -- is substantial, and the absence of iron-clad certainty does not justify apathy. Although industry has frequently opposed environmental or health regulations that were later justified by proof measured in deaths, illness and injury, industry has not always cried wolf -- productivity and competitiveness can be hindered by poorly designed regulation. This is why we should rely on systems such as emission credit trading to mitigate the impact of climate change.
Second, the cost of obtaining ``dead certain proof'' could be high. Even if one argues that the science is not perfect, one must also acknowledge that the cost associated with certainty could be measured in more heat waves, pest infestation, storm damage, and rising sea levels. A realistic regulatory program would set in motion public- and private-sector initiatives to capture the cheap reductions as soon as possible, while we continue to validate the science.
Third, the cost is low for insurance that takes the form of new national regulatory programs. With the right policies, such as a carbon credit trading program and incentives to start reducing carbon emissions sooner rather than later, the cost of control for the next five years would be negligible.
Stephen DeCanio, an economist with President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisors, has pointed out that to cut emissions from 1990 levels by 20 percent, eight climate economic models show GDP losses of .9 percent to 1.7 percent, but that a 1.0 percent loss of GDP would amount to ``less than six months of normal economic growth.'' This means a half-year's delay in reaching the standard of living that would have been achieved without emissions curtailment -- hardly the end of Western economies.
Why is there so much confusion about costs? When economic modelers use different assumptions, the models yield a wide array of results. But when Robert Repetto of the World Resources Institute recently analyzed many of the economic models forecasting impacts of a carbon control program, he found that when they used the same assumptions, the models gave generally similar results, namely a small and potentially favorable macroeconomic impact. This makes sense, since for 95 percent of U.S. industrial employment, energy costs are less than 5 percent of the value of total output.
The regulatory flexibility currently advocated by the more pro-active members of industry builds on 20 years of experience with air pollution credit trading in the United States. The General Accounting Office, OECD and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have documented that between 1976 and 1995 these programs saved U.S. industry billions of dollars, as compared with alternative command and control regulatory schemes.
The keys to success are simplicity, incrementalism, and an early start date. Steady reductions of 1 percent to 2 percent per year from our currently high emissions base will prompt a clear demand for solar power, wind power, fuel cells and other 21st-century technologies, thereby creating a demand for efficiency in energy and manufacturing.
To solve the climate-change problem, we need to implement those systems that reward people for saving energy, reducing emissions and building a culture that identifies and corrects inefficient use of resources. Meanwhile, low-cost carbon reductions will be achieved, as well as nitrogen dioxide, particulate and sulfur emissions reductions. If the problem turns out to be a mirage, we can stop. If the problem is more severe than expected, we can phase in larger reductions.
It's time to stop debating the issues surrounding climate-change initiatives and focus instead on simple, realistic, cost-effective solutions. This is one area where an ounce of near-term prevention will be worth considerably more than a pound of cure later on.Kenneth L.

Full text: United Information Systems, one of Brazil's largest computer makers and distributors, has merged with Boca Raton-based Seaton Group Inc. The combined company is run by United's managers and called UIS Industries Inc.
The Brazilian company last year had combined U.S. and South American sales of $90 million and net profit exceeding $3.5 million.
-- Boca Raton-based executive search firm the Curtiss Group International has formed an alliance with Coopers & Lybrand offices in Brazil and opened a branch in Brussels, said President Bill Frank. -- Miami-based FDP Corp. reached two software agreements for its home office system products in South Africa and the Netherlands, worth about $6 million through fiscal 1998. FDP develops and sells software for life insurance and employee benefits companies. -- Mexico's Trade Commission has relocated in Miami to the new offices of Mexico's foreign trade bank, Bancomext, 220 Alhambra Circle, Suite 210, Coral Gables, FL 33134. Tel: 305-442-7374. Fax: 305-442-4147.
THE NUMBERS
-- Mexican officials expect the economy to grow by 5.2 percent next year, down from 6.5 percent this year. The government has no plans to cut the 15 percent sales tax or 34 percent corporate tax rate. -- Peruvian officials expect the economy to grow by 5 percent next year, down from 7 percent this year. That's partly because El Nino's climate change could hurt fishing and farming. -- Enterprise Florida's export mission to Venezuela from Sept. 28-Oct. 2 generated 89 trade leads, $2.4 million in immediate sales and $19.6 million in projected sales for the eight participating Florida companies.

Abstract: EU energy ministers meeting in Brussels will try to agree plans to open Europe's $100bn-a-year natural gas market to competition. After eight years of discussion, and a renewed push for agreement since last year's deal on liberalisation of the electricity market, a compromise plan has largely been agreed. The key question remains the extent to which the market would be opened to competition, and which customers would be eligible to shop around for gas supplies. Luxembourg, holder of the EU presidency, proposes opening about 23 per cent of the market - accounted for by the largest energy users in each EU state - initially, rising to 28 per cent after five years, and 33 per cent after 10 years, similar to the pattern of the electricity directive. Al Gore, US vice-president, makes a one-day trip to Kyoto to meet international delegates at the UN climate change conference on Monday, when ministerial-level meetings start to round up last week's talks. Mr Gore will give a speech which delegates hope may break the deadlock in the negotiations. The 10-day conference is scheduled to end on Wednesday with agreement among developed countries on targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but progress has been slow. The US has demanded participation by developing countries as a precondition for signing the agreement, and Mr Gore said last week that the US was prepared to walk away from an unsatisfactory agreement. Controversy has already marred the first world chess championship played on the knock-out system, at Groningen, Netherlands. Nearly 100 grandmasters compete for the right to challenge the Russian holder Anatoly Karpov in next month's final. World number one Garry Kasparov has refused to take part, while world number two Vladimir Kramnik has also withdrawn on the grounds that Karpov has an unfair advantage. The record $5m prize fund is guaranteed by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of the International Chess Federation and ruler of the Caucasian republic of Kalmykia, where critics allege that oil and caviar revenues are being squandered on off-beat projects such as the newly constructed Chess City.

Gore takes the heat
Al Gore, US vice-president, makes a one-day trip to Kyoto to meet international delegates at the UN climate change conference on Monday, when ministerial-level meetings start to round up last week's talks. Mr Gore will give a speech which delegates hope may break the deadlock in the negotiations.

The US has demanded participation by developing countries as a precondition for signing the agreement, and Mr Gore said last week that the US was prepared to walk away from an unsatisfactory agreement.
Mating game
Controversy has already marred the first world chess championship played on the knock-out system, at Groningen, Netherlands. Nearly 100 grandmasters compete for the right to challenge the Russian holder Anatoly Karpov in next month's final. World number one Garry Kasparov has refused to take part, while world number two Vladimir Kramnik has also withdrawn on the grounds that Karpov has an unfair advantage. The record $5m prize fund is guaranteed by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of the International Chess Federation and ruler of the Caucasian republic of Kalmykia, where critics allege that oil and caviar revenues are being squandered on off-beat projects such as the newly constructed Chess City.
Refugee count
The United Nations refugee agency publishes its annual report on the state of the world's refugees. The Geneva-based UN High Commissioner for Refugees has been forced to cut budgets next year because funding has fallen along with declining refugee emergencies. However, the report points out that the numbers of internally displaced and stateless people are rising and, unlike refugees fleeing across national borders, they often have little or no access to international assistance. The UNHCR has a current caseload of about 23m refugees and displaced people, down from 26m in early 1996.
Foreign affairs
EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels to prepare for this week's EU summit in Luxembourg, where plans for eastern enlargement are at the top of the agenda. Ministers will also discuss the follow-up to last week's summit with the US and Canada.

Deadline Bosnia
Bosnia's ethnic communities will come under strong pressure to settle quickly the many remaining disputes hampering reintegration of their war-shattered country. The western powers which, together with Russia and Japan, make up the Bosnian Peace Implementation Council are expected to call at their two-day meeting in Bonn for Serbs, Moslems and Croats to agree common citizenship, passport and car registration laws by December 15, and currency and customs arrangements and a new national flag by December 20. Earlier deadlines have been ignored by the Bosnian Serb republic and the Moslem-Croat federation.
European diagnosis
The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe publishes its latest economic assessment of Europe's economies. The UN/ECE, which has traditionally focused on central and eastern Europe, says that aggregate output has grown this year in the transition economies for the first time since the collapse of communism in 1989. In particular, the economic decline in Russia appears to have ended - though there is no sign of the promised recovery. Most other countries in the region have seen positive growth in the past two years.
Korean settlement bid
Historic negotiations on a permanent settlement to the Korean conflict begin in Geneva between North and South Korea, the US and China. The four-party talks, hosted by the Swiss government, kick off with a two-day opening session, but diplomats say they could last for months or years.
Islamic summit
Some 2,000 official delegates are expected to attend the three-day summit of the Organisation of Islamic Conference in Tehran, including 35 heads of state from Moslem countries. Another 15 delegations of "special guests" have been invited. The 55-member organisation's summit will discuss regional issues such as the Arab-Israeli conflict and Afghanistan and ways of improving trade and economic relations between Islamic countries.
Russia's WTO application
The World Trade Organisation working party considering Russia's membership application meets in Geneva. The talks are moving more slowly than hoped because of delays by Moscow in producing offers to open up its domestic market for goods and services. Russia and the US agreed earlier this year that they would aim for Russian entry in 1998, but this now looks an unlikely prospect.

Labour facing revolt
Britain's Labour government faces its first serious backbench revolt since the election in a vote to cut benefits to lone parents. Ministers' decision to go ahead with the cuts, proposed by the previous Conservative government, prompted more than 100 Labour MPs to write a private letter to Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, calling for the plans to be postponed. Some were placated by Mr Brown's Green Budget plans to pump ¬£300m into childcare and helping lone parents find jobs. A number of Labour members are expected to vote against the measure or abstain.

Sinn Fein at No 10
Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein leaders, are due to meet Tony Blair, the UK prime minister, in Downing Street. Conservatives and Ulster Unionists have expressed outrage at the meeting, the first time a senior Irish Republican has been invited to Downing Street since 1921. But Mr Blair has indicated he is determined to treat Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, the same as other parties involved in the Northern Ireland talks.
Chileans vote
Some 8m Chileans go to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and half the senate. The centre-left government coalition, the Concertation of Parties for Democracy, expects to keep its majority in the lower house and hopes to win one or two more seats in the senate. The real balance of power in congress will not be clear, however, until just before Christmas, when the armed forces and the supreme court have named five of the nine "institutional" senators. The one secure new member is Chile's former dictator, Gen Augusto Pinochet, who takes an automatic ex-officio seat when he retires from the army command in March.
No jobs for the girls

Enlargement summit
EU leaders meet in Luxembourg for a two-day summit which is expected to select a short-list of countries from central and eastern Europe that are ready to open negotiations in March 1998 on entry to the Union around the turn of the century. The favoured countries are expected to be the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Estonia and Slovenia, to be joined by Cyprus. EU leaders will agree special assistance to Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia and offer the disappointed countries the possibility of a review of their applications in a year's time. The 15 heads of government will try to placate Turkey with the promise of inclusion in a pan-European conference next year.
Financial services pact
Today is the deadline for concluding a World Trade Organisation pact on liberalising global financial services markets. Negotiators will have been working round the clock to squeeze out the maximum improvements in foreign access to trading partners' banking, insurance and securities sectors. But the final say will lie with Washington, which walked away from an earlier deal in 1995.

Czech conference
The Czech Civic Democratic party, which has led the country since 1992, holds an extraordinary conference to elect a new leader after the resignation of prime minister Vaclav Klaus last month over a corporate donation scandal. Mr Klaus has said he will stand again and so far no serious rival candidate has come forward. The conference is likely to be bitter, with a division between Mr Klaus and other senior members of the party, and between regional party members, who are thought to back Mr Klaus, and deputies, most of whom want him to step down. If Mr Klaus is re-elected, the party could split and early elections will be likely. Compiled by Roger Beale. Fax: (+44) (0)171 873 3196. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997.

Full text: ¬† Few issues have generated more submissions to this page lately than the Kyoto conference. Below are some selections.
Just who are the 2,600 scientists proclaiming the certitude of human-caused global warming? Nine out of 10 are unqualified to render expert opinions, according to a Citizens for a Sound Economy study. Among the so-called experts: a plastic surgeon, landscape architects, lawyers, dermatologists, English and linguistics experts, a hotel administrator, a gynecologist, sociologists - even an expert in traditional Chinese medicine!
Beginning with the discovery of fire, energy has enabled us to move from cave dwellings to today's unprecedented quality of life. Now we're being pressured to take immediate, draconian action to answer a question we don't yet understand. Given the immense sweep of human history, a few more years invested in learning more about the science of global climate change cannot but improve our response.
Juli McGreevy, state coordinator
Coalition for Vehicle Choice
If President Clinton is to restore U.S. environmental credibility in Kyoto, he needs to offer a major national initiative to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
How about some EPA automobile legislation that includes sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and minivans? Require that by 2003 these vehicles meet today's average fuel efficiency requirements (27.5 mpg) for cars. (Right now, they don't have to.) Require government offices to purchase fuel-cell vehicles as available. Impose a 1-cent-per-gallon gas surcharge through the year 2010 - proceeds paid proportionally by market share to U.S.-originating passenger vehicle manufacturers. Link insurance liability rates to vehicle weight. A Ford Escort, at under 2700 pounds, would get a rebate of $50, while a Ford Expedition, at 5000 pounds, would carry an insurance liability surcharge of $400.
The 1-cent gas tax and sales surcharges would generate hundreds of millions of dollars for carmakers. It would also mean massive savings in U.S. petrodollars.
Here's how: If we held minivans and SUVs to automobile standards, they would have to get 2.6 more miles to the gallon. That would save an average of 46 gallons per new vehicle per year. And it would cut vehicle carbon dioxide emissions by 10.4 percent.
Now, 15.5 million new vehicles are to be made in the 1998 model year. Saving that 2.6 miles per gallon means we could buy 42.4 million less gallons of oil (which we would have used to make gas). With crude oil at roughly $17 a barrel, that's a savings of $721 million in imported oil per year - almost 8 percent of 1995 petroleum imports from Persian Gulf states.
Such savings would help trim our burgeoning trade deficit, slow our growing dependence on foreign oil, and increase the international marketability and sales of U.S. cars.
These proposals would significantly and quickly decrease U.S. pollution and reestablish U.S. environmental credibility. Can Congress offer something better?
Theodore L. Gaillard Jr.
Philadelphia-based writer on
military and economic affairs
Many American industries seem blind to the economic opportunities a strong Kyoto climate agreement could bring.
Cutting emissions will create new markets - for silicon solar cells, fiberglass wind turbines, and hybrid electric cars, to mention three - which could create one of the largest new growth sectors of the 21st century. The global wind power industry is a $2-billion-a-year business growing at 25 percent per year. The world market for solar cells has gone from $350 million in 1998 to roughly $1 billion in 1997. A new generation of hybrid electric cars, with twice the fuel economy and half the carbon dioxide emissions of today's cars, is also on the way.
If energy becomes a business based on information, manufacturing and services - rather than finding, extracting, and processing buried fuels - leadership in energy would shift from countries that sit atop large reservoirs of hydrocarbons to those with the innovation, infrastructure and skills to predominate in a new high-tech industry. The United States is in a good position to compete in such an industry.
Christopher Flavin, president
Seth Dunn, staff researcher
Worldwatch Institute
Behind the big debate over global warming lie questions of overpopulation and sustainable development. Asia and Latin America say they need to speed up industrial production to give their growing millions a decent standard of living. As populations grow, more and more forests are burned to create farmland, and more energy-consuming, smoke-throwing factories emerge, along with more gas-guzzling vehicles.
Instead of punishing developing countries who've come late to the dance, the United States and the other industrialized nations should work to guide them to a sustainable mode of growth. The industrialized countries can set an example by curbing their consumerist lifestyles and cutting down emissions. And they - the United States especially - must help developing countries with runaway population growth, to balance their numbers with available resources.
Werner Fornos, president
Population Institute
Do you look forward to paying more for electricity and gasoline? Do you want government to tell you that you can't buy certain cars because they don't get enough miles to the gallon? If your answer is no, then you're not ready for what's coming out of Kyoto. The Clinton administration and allies have done everything they can to hide the high price tag that comes with controlling greenhouse gases.
It means higher gasoline and electricity costs and lower economic growth. One economic study by the respected WEFA Group forecasts additional costs of $30,000 over the next twenty years for a family of four. And the goal of those pushing a Kyoto treaty is indeed to make us poorer by cutting our energy use. President Clinton, of course, denies there is a price to be paid.
China, India and Mexico know better. They are refusing to commit to any limits on their own economic growth. If we sign a treaty to reduce our own greenhouse emissions while exempting all developing countries, there will be a massive transfer of American industrial jobs to these countries - and no global reductions in greenhouse gases.

Traditional approaches will have to give way to innovative ones if countries are to agree on firm targets and timetables in Kyoto.
A system of tradeable emission permits, the keystone of the Clinton plan, is one such approach. We can't draw property lines in the atmosphere, but we can grant rights to emit air pollution, rights that can be traded like shares of stock. Some people think this is like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank. But if we limit emission permits to a level below what would happen otherwise, they will reduce pollution.
The U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 already mandate tradable emission allowances for electric utilities - and the system is working. It will also work with nations. If we assign permits in a flexible, equitable manner, their impact should be reasonable and proportionate from country to country. That alone should remind Kyoto representatives that debating fine points is unnecessary, and they may then turn to the business of designing a fair and workable system.

This is an economic meeting disguised as an environmental meeting which is part of a Chinese plot.
Sen. Michael Enzi (R., Wyo.)
Even if one assumes that heavy costs are associated with immediately reducing greenhouse gas emissions, there are still good reasons for early action. One is legal, as enshrined in a principle of the [1992 United Nations Climate Change Convention], which states that parties to the convention are to take ``precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects.'' Another is scientific. The authors of IMAGE 2, a Dutch study, showed that early action is critical when taking environmental and economic goals into consideration. As the authors pointed out, ``If global emissions are too high in the year 2010, there is little chance afterwards to make a course correction which avoids climate-related impacts.''
What, though, are the chances of our being able to make such a course correction? According to M. Da-Huong, M. Grubb, and J.-C. Hourcade, authors of another study, they are low. Their bottom line is that if we acknowledge that there is a significant risk that we need to stay below a particular level, then, given the socioeconomic inertia in energy systems, delay will prove costly. The authors' conclusion is that there is a pressing case for limiting carbon dioxide emissions now.
In all, this is far more than a scholarly debate between proponents of ``act now'' and proponents of ``delay until later.'' What countries agree
at Kyoto and then proceed to do will have a profound impact on future outcomes . . .

Almost no attention has been given to how a global warming treaty will be implemented and enforced and what consequences it will have for our national sovereignty and personal freedoms.
If relying on national governments to police their own industries has proved unworkable, then an international authority with the power to compel compliance is the logical consequence. It will be necessary to monitor the internal economic activities of all the countries involved. It will require countless inspectors and a large international bureaucracy, probably under the United Nations, to collect, process and analyze the data.
In all, we are likely to be left with a vast new international bureaucracy looking for something to do. We will have taken the first step toward imposing centralized energy planning, with all the loss of sovereignty and individual liberty that such a global regime entails.

Abstract: Executives representing more than 70 insurance companies around the world yesterday indicated that they would be reviewing their investment strategies to support more environment-friendly alternatives to burning oil and coal. One of them, Ms Tessa Tennant of NPI Global Care Investments, even suggested that advertisements for oil and petrol should carry government health warnings to raise public awareness about climate change. Mr Andrew Dlugolecki, assistant general manager at General Accident, said insurance companies with large shareholdings are now analysing their strategies, in particular for the energy, transport and tourism industries.

Full text: Executives representing more than 70 insurance companies around the world yesterday indicated that they would be reviewing their investment strategies to support more environment-friendly alternatives to burning oil and coal. One of them, Ms Tessa Tennant of NPI Global Care Investments, even suggested that advertisements for oil and petrol should carry government health warnings to raise public awareness about climate change.
Mr Andrew Dlugolecki, assistant general manager at General Accident, said insurance companies with large shareholdings are now analysing their strategies, in particular for the energy, transport and tourism industries.
"If they have not got a strategy to deal with climate change, they will not be a good investment. We are not saying to member-companies that they should not invest in coal or oil, but to give serious thought to whether these industries can cope with the future".
Mr Dlugolecki was speaking at a news conference on the fifth day of the Kyoto Climate Change Summit as delegates representing 147 countries continued their negotiations on a legally-binding protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The 70-plus companies involved in the UN Environment Programmes Insurance Industry Initiative have annual revenues exceeding $2 trillion and thus cannot be ignored. They have emerged as an important counterweight to the fossil fuel lobby.
It has been estimated that as much as one-third of investments in global stock markets, amounting to more than $15 trillion, are managed by insurance companies and pension funds. "We have a serious duty to safeguard our funds", Mr Dlugolecki said.
In their position paper, published yesterday, the companies allied with UNEP said it was "in the interests of the industry to understand better the investment opportunities and challenges which will arise from measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
They warned that even small shifts in regional climate zones or storm patterns, brought about by global warming, carried the risk of a "large increase" in property damage, which would leave the industry exposed to massive claims. Natural disasters already represent 85 per cent of insured catastrophes world-wide, amounting to $12.4 billion in 1995.
But climate change poses other risks, too. For example, changes in human health due to the spreading of diseases may affect the life assurance and pension industries, while shifts in agricultural production could have an impact on crop insurance.

Abstract: Even the bushes in Kyoto have feelings this week. "Silent but angry", said one placard posted on a shrub outside the climate change conference yesterday. Another, also installed in a dawn raid by Japanese environmentalists, wondered: "Are u going to save us, Al?" ahead of Monday's arrival of Al Gore, the "green" US vice-president. The conference centre itself resembles a cross between a traditional Japanese temple and a space ship. The mission of the 10,000 green creatures inside is to save Mother Earth - as the official Japanese poster describes the planet - from increased drought, flooding, and freak weather associated wth climate change.

Full text: Even the bushes in Kyoto have feelings this week. "Silent but angry", said one placard posted on a shrub outside the climate change conference yesterday. Another, also installed in a dawn raid by Japanese environmentalists, wondered: "Are u going to save us, Al?" ahead of Monday's arrival of Al Gore, the "green" US vice-president.
The conference centre itself resembles a cross between a traditional Japanese temple and a space ship. The mission of the 10,000 green creatures inside is to save Mother Earth - as the official Japanese poster describes the planet - from increased drought, flooding, and freak weather associated wth climate change.
Perhaps as an insurance policy against failure, all the world's 166 nations are represented in an ark-shaped conference hall. There they sit in alphabetical order from Albania to Zimbabwe, wrangling over 21st century targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels.
But for those who do not much like the idea of a future free of coal, oil or gas, alternatives include installing "sinks".
This is alien conference jargon for forests that can absorb some of the carbon dioxide spewed out by cars and power plants.
The back entrance to Kyoto's International Conference Centre offers no escape. There, Greenpeace , the environmental group which wants to replace fossil fuels with solar power, yesterday erected a dinosaur made of oil cans and spare car parts.
A banner summed up its view of progress in the negotiations so far: Dinosaur Diplomacy 1, Climate 0.
The 18-strong Greenpeace delegation had started the week with gentler tactics of persuasion by offering "free solar coffee" from a mobile kitchen generating electricity from sunlight.
Inside the conference hall, official negotiators rub shoulders with lobbyists pushing everything from nuclear energy ("Give them a Future Green with Energy") to, in the lone case of the Japan Bicycle Promotion Institute, getting on your bike.
Thrown into the mix are 4,000 journalists. On call to help them around computers on loan for the conference are official "cyber-guides".
Occasionally, delegates retreat across the road for consultations or snatches of sleep at the equally futuristic Takaragaike Prince Hotel.
This informs visitors its aim is to try to help save the planet with measures that include turning down the lights in corridors used by staff.
Guests are offered Y2,000 ($15) discounts for every day they agree not to have their towels and sheets changed.
Tomorrow, the not quite lost ark turns from publicity stunts to God.
Raul Estrada-Oyuela, the embattled Argentine chairman of the negotiations, is to lead an Inter-Religious Gathering on Climate Change at Kyoto's Kamawarachi cathedral.

Abstract: European and Asian insurance companies, which are among the world's biggest stock owners, warned environment-damaging companies yesterday that they will unload their shares if they do not mend their ways. The insurance industry, which controls pounds 10,000 billion in equities, a third of the value of global stockmarkets, held a press briefing as a "counterweight" to the fossil-fuel lobby, which publicly admits that it wants to wreck the climate talks in Kyoto. Andrew Dlugolecki, of General Accident, said this was going a bit far, but added: "What we are saying to individual companies in which we have large shareholdings is that we are analysing their strategies on the environment. We will be looking particularly at companies in the energy, transport and tourist industries. If they have not got a strategy for dealing with climate change they will not be a good investment.

Full text: EUROPEAN and Asian insurance companies, which are among the world's biggest stock owners, warned environment-damaging companies yesterday that they will unload their shares if they do not mend their ways.
The insurance industry, which controls pounds 10,000 billion in equities, a third of the value of global stockmarkets, held a press briefing as a "counterweight" to the fossil-fuel lobby, which publicly admits that it wants to wreck the climate talks in Kyoto.
NPI, one of the more radical British pension and insurance companies, said oil and petrol advertising should carry global health warnings, as tobacco advertising carries personal health messages.
Tessa Tennant, speaking for the company, said: "This is a precautionary measure which all governments can readily take. It is widely recognised that transport emissions are a significant and increasing source of various pollutants. Let us focus on this and get the message across to people in their daily lives."
Andrew Dlugolecki, of General Accident, said this was going a bit far, but added: "What we are saying to individual companies in which we have large shareholdings is that we are analysing their strategies on the environment. We will be looking particularly at companies in the energy, transport and tourist industries. If they have not got a strategy for dealing with climate change they will not be a good investment.
"We are not saying to member companies they should not invest in coal or oil, but {asking them} to give serious thought to whether these companies can cope with the future, and use their influence to change the ways of these companies. We have a serious duty to safeguard our funds."
Elizabeth Dowdeswell, secretary-general of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), said 85 per cent of insurance company losses were due to natural disasters. It was a giant industry with a $2,000 billion turnover, several times more than the entire oil industry.
UNEP had been working for two years with 71 insurance companies on the issue of climate change. The commendable decision to base some of their investment decisions on the companies' attitudes towards global warming was the result of this liaison.
Ivo Knoepful of Swiss Reinsurance, a pounds 30 billion company, said: "We can only afford to invest in progressive companies. Rail companies are really in the business of transportation, oil companies need to reclassify themselves as energy industries and get into the future."
Mr Dlugolecki said: "It is a serious issue which our members can no longer ignore."
One bad storm in the southern United States could cost pounds 100 billion in property losses. A 10 per cent increase in wind speed in storms - one of the possible consequences of climate change - could increase insurance losses by 150 per cent.
In the US, insurance companies paying compensation for houses destroyed by flooding are already stipulating that the replacement should be built in a safer place.
In Britain drought caused by climate change cost the insurance industry pounds 500 million in claims in 1990 and 1991. Payments are expected to rise by 50 per cent, to pounds 750 million a year, by 2020.
The Hadley Centre for Climate Change in Berkshire confirmed in Kyoto yesterday that 1997 was the hottest year recorded.
Despite US insistence that nothing has changed, delegates say that Washington will agree to a reduction target of at least 5 per cent by the time negotiations end on Wednesday. This has been made possible by including only three gases - carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide - in the reduction targets.
The US originally wanted to include three CFC substitutes made and sold there. Without these three, the US can reduce emissions by 5 per cent by 2012 without taking additional measures.

Full text: 2100 THE WORLD WITH TWICE THE CARDON DIOXIDE joined to story.
Failure to act now on greenhouse gases guarantees climate change that will take "centuries to millennia" to reverse, international scientists warned yesterday in a powerful foray into the debate at the Kyoto summit.
The new chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Dr Robert Watson, also increased the moral pressure on Australia and the United States over their demands for greater Third World commitments to cut the gases.
He warned that the worst impacts of global warming - revealed yesterday in a new report - would fall on the "poorest of the poor".
The report, by the leading international climate scientists who advise the United Nations, also warns of high vulnerability for Australia's ecosystems, coastal zones, water resources, human settlements and health.
The IPCC released only a summary of its extensive reports for 10 global regions.
But the Herald has obtained a copy of the full chapter on Australasia, which suggests New Zealand could fare considerably better than Australia. It also suggests greater economic loss for Australia than the average for the world if nothing is done about global warming.
The range of loss for Australia and New Zealand combined is put at minus 1.2 to minus 3.8 per cent of gross domestic product, or up to about $18 billion a year for Australia. Dr Watson put the "crude estimate" of worldwide losses from inaction at between 1 and 2.5 per cent of global output.
The Australasian chapter also warns of "environmental refugees", as both Australian island territories and small Pacific nations face inundation, and a threat of greater property insurance premiums for Australians.
Today, the huge international insurance industry is expected to boost pressure for strong action by developed nations at Kyoto, publishing a position paper on climate change and indicating a shift away from investments in companies that fail to reduce or diversify energy use.
However, famine, floods and disease in the developing countries dominated the impacts predicted for a "double CO world" - where levels of the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, reach twice the level of the pre-industrial era around 2100.
"The bottom line is fundamentally that developing countries are more vulnerable than developed countries in a changed climate world, with the poorest of the poor being most vulnerable," said Dr Watson.
Both he and his immediate predecessor, IPCC chairman emeritus Professor Bert Bolin, urged delegates from 160 nations to resolve their many differences and to act now.
"If we wait for perfect knowledge and we do not like that changed environment, it would not take us decades to reverse the damage, it would potentially take centuries to millennia," Dr Watson said. "Hence actions now have implications for future generations and that is the real challenge for the policymakers."
Both Professor Bolin and Dr Watson defended the IPCC's work against attacks by climate change sceptics. Professor Bolin said he deplored the lack of scientific openness and honesty by some critics, while Dr Watson expressed concern about their influence over many US politicians.

Abstract: Climate change could be a deceptively pleasant experience at first, with many experiencing long, hot summers of the sort occurring only once a century. But the cost of natural disasters is expected to rise sharply. In a joint statement with the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) , a group of 35 insurers from Europe and Japan will express support for a market-based approach to imposing limits, where countries could trade their carbon emissions allowances. The report will recommend businesses take urgent action. "Climate change will have a big effect on some industries and you have to plan for it," says Andrew Dlugolecki, assistant general manager of General Accident , the UK insurer.

Full text: Climate change could be a deceptively pleasant experience at first, with many experiencing long, hot summers of the sort occurring only once a century. But the cost of natural disasters is expected to rise sharply.
The world's biggest insurance companies, concerned they will bear the brunt, will urge world leaders in Kyoto today to agree international curbs on greenhouse gases.
In a joint statement with the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) , a group of 35 insurers from Europe and Japan will express support for a market-based approach to imposing limits, where countries could trade their carbon emissions allowances.
The report will recommend businesses take urgent action. "Climate change will have a big effect on some industries and you have to plan for it," says Andrew Dlugolecki, assistant general manager of General Accident , the UK insurer.
Insurance companies believe global warming is already altering weather patterns. Natural disasters, mainly windstorms and flooding, have increased more than fourfold during the past 20 years, says Munich Re, the world's biggest reinsurer.
From 1987 to 1993, 16 catastrophes occurred, costing more than $1bn (¬£600m) each, resulting in insured losses worldwide of more than $50bn. Of those, 85 per cent were due to windstorms and 15 per cent to earthquakes, oil spills and fire.
Even small shifts in storm patterns can cause a big rise in property damage. Computer simulations show that if the strength of a hurricane rises by 10 per cent, a 150 per cent increase in damage can occur, says Mr Dlugolecki.
The cost of natural disasters has risen with the concentration of wealth in the world's most developed cities. A hurricane hitting Miami tomorrow could cause damage totalling $100bn.
Beyond recommending that limits be imposed on carbon emissions, the insurers say investment managers should help develop environmental reporting standards to be used "alongside benchmarks for profitability and security.It also says that the capital resources of both the public and private sector should aim to promote "alternative energy generation and use".
Insurance companies manage nearly a third of investments in global stock markets.
US insurers have yet to express strong support for curbing emissions. The Re-insurance Association of America says some of its members fear they could be held legally responsible for signing the UNEP document. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1997. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: THE UNITED Nations' climate summit that opened this week in Kyoto, Japan, will probably not end in a flaming row. Countries must not lose face, and so they are more likely to cobble together some shoddy compromise that is worth nothing. But a spectacular failure would be much better, for at least it might get the donkey's attention. Or more precisely, the frog's attention. Environmentalists often compare human behavior to that of frogs -- who, if you drop them into a pot of boiling water, will jump right out again and survive. But sit a frog in a pot of cool water, raise the heat gradually, and he'll sit there happily until he boils to death. The haze is gone from Malaysia now, but a cabaret group, Instant Cafe, is still getting a lot of mileage out of it. They were playing a corporate function in Kuala Lumpur last weekend -- people who'd coughed and wept their way through the haze for all of September and October -- and the audience rocked with laughter when they did their "Haze" song:

Countries must not lose face, and so they are more likely to cobble together some shoddy compromise that is worth nothing. But a spectacular failure would be much better, for at least it might get the donkey's attention.
Or more precisely, the frog's attention. Environmentalists often compare human behavior to that of frogs -- who, if you drop them into a pot of boiling water, will jump right out again and survive. But sit a frog in a pot of cool water, raise the heat gradually, and he'll sit there happily until he boils to death.
Are humans really like frogs? Of course they are. Take Malaysians, for example.
A hazy situation
The haze is gone from Malaysia now, but a cabaret group, Instant Cafe, is still getting a lot of mileage out of it. They were playing a corporate function in Kuala Lumpur last weekend -- people who'd coughed and wept their way through the haze for all of September and October -- and the audience rocked with laughter when they did their "Haze" song:
Come and visit Malaysia.
Come and stay for lots of days
You don't need your suntan lotion.
You'll be safe from UV rays.
No need to sunbathe by the ocean.
Get dark by strolling in our haze.
The "haze" is mostly smoke from the thousands of forest fires that are set in Indonesia every dry season: First you log out any commercially valuable trees, then you burn the rest because that's the cheapest way to clear the land for cultivation. The smoke from huge areas of burning forest drifts over neighboring Malaysia, blocking out the sun and causing respiratory disorders.
The haze was particularly bad in 1991, when the eruption of Mount Pinatubo added extra ash to the atmosphere. It was even worse this year because of the prolonged drought caused by El Nino. But it happens every year, and it will go on happening until the region's rain forests are all gone. (At the current loss rate of around 3 percent per year, that will be around 30 years from now.)
Yet few Malaysians think they can do anything about it because they know that the companies that are setting most of the fires in Indonesia have close links with Indonesian President Suharto's government in Jakarta, and generally get their way.
They are also vaguely aware that destroying the forests raises the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming. But that problem isn't affecting their daily lives yet, and they have lots of present worries to keep them busy.
A breed apart
People in large industrialized democracies like the United States like to think they are different: better information, more open societies, a more educated public. But, in fact,they are equally captive to special interest groups.
The United States, for example, promised at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio to cut its carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Instead, U.S. carbon emissions are 13 percent higher than in 1990, and Washington is now saying that it can't get back down to the target figure until 2013. What happened?
The Clinton administration knows what it should do. At a preparatory meeting of the climate change conference in Geneva earlier this year, the United States mobilized the world's big insurance companies, who proved that global warming was already hitting their balance sheets in terms of claims for storm damage.
That debunked the "junk science" (paid for by fossil fuel producers) that pretends a global warming is just an unproven hypothesis. With the European Union offering emission cuts to 14 percent below 1990 levels by 2010 and the U.S. government also apparently on board, success in Kyoto seemed within reach.
True, the Australians, who export a lot of coal, were arguing that there should be no common global target, just individual targets tailored to individual countries' situations. (Agree to that, and you will spend the next century in negotiations.)
Some oil-rich states were even insisting that if the world cut back on fossil fuel use, they must be compensated financially. But it was clear that once the United States openly espoused a tough target for cutting emissions, a lot of the resistance would crumble.
What went wrong? Basically, Mr. Clinton belatedly realized that U.S. fossil fuel producers, in alliance with other major industries that worry about higher energy costs, control enough U.S. senators to block any treaty that hurts their interests. So rather than fight a hopeless battle, he has chosen pre-emptive surrender.
Getting hotter
Just as in Jakarta, the tail is wagging the dog. Many more Americans have an interest in curbing global warming than in the industries that cause it, but the majority is less conscious of its interests: The water in the pot is getting hotter, but only gradually, So the prospective victims exert less political pressure, and the other side gets its way.
Without a serious American offer on cutting emissions, none of the other hold-outs at Kyoto will be under any pressure to yield, for the United States is the most flagrant polluter of all (4 percent of the world's population, 24 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions). So the best that can be hoped for at Kyoto is dramatic failure.
The Europeans should stick to their proposal and make no compromises. They won't get their way, but that will at least ensure that the problem isn't shelved for five years after a cynical deal that leaves everyone free to do whatever they want.

Full text: WITH the driest conditions on record for parts of southern Australia and fire brigades already battling another devastating bushfire season, it might be time for rural and outer-suburban voters to rethink their attitude to climate change.
Despite the Federal Government's denial of the internationally agreed science, it continues to fund important research on measures to counteract the impact of the climate change it denies.
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) continues to search for crops that will survive increased insect infestation and other climate change impacts. But what might help the Coalition Government pay attention to its farming constituency and marginal seat voters - ahead of the coal and oil industries - is the threat of bushfires, with an expected doubling of bushfire days in much of south-eastern Australia over the next few decades.
Ash Wednesday in February 1983 claimed 76 lives in Victoria and South Australia. In 1967, 62 people died in fires in and around Hobart. The Insurance Council of Australia says the material cost of major bushfires in the past 30 years is about $700 million in current values. The insurance loss in the 1994 NSW bushfires was $56 million and Ash Wednesday cost $320 million.
While the figures account for the damage to buildings, they do not include the cost of the lives of the firefighters and civilians killed in the fires. Nor does Mr Howard's claimed cost of responding to climate change include the loss of work time for volunteer firefighters, the cost to industry of lost production, nor the financial benefits to Australia from being ahead of the world on emissions reduction and new technology rather than lagging a decade behind our competitors.
But before the fossil fuel lobby begins to argue that Australia always has had bushfires and there is no alternative to oil, two facts should be noted: first, the CSIRO expects a doubling in the number of days over 35 degrees by 2070; second, "Australian forest fires become impossible to control when the temperature reaches about 35 degrees, the relative humidity falls below 20 per cent and the winds are in the range of 10-18 metres/sec [36-65km/h or 20-35 knots]" (Bureau of Meteor
ology, Victoria).
The rise in days over 35 degrees means fire services will be increasingly in demand, while some State governments - such as Victoria - attempt to wind back budgets or, worse, privatise the services, and the Federal Government goes into deep denial over the effect of polluting our atmosphere.
From an average of nine days exceeding 35 degrees in Tatura (Victoria) at present, the Goulburn Valley fruit-growing town can expect 12 hot days a year by 2030 and 22 days above 35 degrees by 2070. It will be a disaster for stone fruit and a massive burden to Shepparton firefighting costs. The increased variability is likely across the continent, with Canberra also expecting twice as many hot days by 2070.
Even with the most cautious conclusions, as recently as May 1997 the CSIRO (in Climate Change, Climatic Hazards and Policy Responses in Australia ) described deaths from bushfires as "an increasing trend".
"The south-east coastal strip of Australia is amongst the most fire-prone in the world," said the CSIRO's Atmospheric Research Division. Despite the complexity of mapping climate projections onto the conditions for bushfires, the CSIRO is in no doubt that "the fire danger is likely to increase if the climate warms".
A NSW Fire Brigade spokesman, John Hoban, says that with the Carr Government's "quantum leap" investment in fire services, the Fire Brigade is prepared for a harsh bushfire season.
"We're probably the best equipped and trained we've ever been," Hoban said. But noting the fires in Indonesia and the first drought in the Papua New Guinea highlands in living memory, he said: "Who knows what's in store for us?
"Weather and fire are unhappy partners," Hoban said. "We look to guidance from the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology and listen to what the experts tell us. We've just got to get the job done."
The chairman of the British Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Sir John Houghton, has won the agreement of 2,000 scientists and 100 governments - but not that of Australia.
Houghton says that if the 1992 Rio de Janeiro UN Conference on Environment and Development emissions agreements were met - we are way behind target - carbon concentrations would not stabilise for 500 years, so human changes to the atmosphere and climate are guaranteed for a long time to come.
The IPCC's work has been assessed by the most learned bodies in the world, including the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. In the most recent RIIA briefing paper on climate change, Duncan Brack and Michael Grubb describe naysaying - denying that there is a problem - as "both irresponsible and doomed as a political strategy".
"Climate change will happen," wrote Brack and Grubb. "Now that the IPCC has completed the largest ever international assessment exercise, no-one who chooses to ignore its conclusions and implications can claim not to have been forewarned."
Instead of just denying the evidence, the Coalition Government has changed tack, now claiming that Australia is a special case. As far as the European Union is concerned, the only special case is that the Australian Government's (ABARE) figures don't add up. Mr Howard's October speech to the Australian Chamber of Manufactures was circulated and ridiculed at the European Commission, with officials saying their Australian counterparts, who had made a positive contribution until March 1996, appeared confused and unprepared.
The head of the European Commission's Delegation on Climate Change, Jorgen Henningsen, went further and said that of all the countries dragging their feet on climate change, Australia was the worst.
The Government's back-to-the-1950s approach guarantees lost opportunities. We have insignificant investment in wind and solar energy because the fossil fuel lobby is far too powerful. Instead of using the environment and taxpayers to subsidise coal and oil, we should be developing next-generation technology for export to our Asian neighbours. If we don't, others will.
How is it that the European Union produces 3,400 megawatts (MW) of wind power, India 820 MW and Australia 2.5 MW? Worse, the sunburnt country produces less than 2 MW of solar power and, according to the Environment Minister, Senator Hill, we are among the world's worst polluters, much of it motor vehicle greenhouse gases.
The cost of Australia doing nothing has been estimated at 3.8 per cent of GDP by the Netherlands-based Institute for Environmental Studies. Financial benefits from developing renewable power technologies are endless, and that is apart from the reduction in climate change, the consequent bushfires and agricultural impacts.
Perhaps after the next Ash Wednesday, when thousands of Australians are homeless and scores of civilians and firefighters are dead, we shall again hear the Prime Minister claiming it was unavoidable, or perhaps, as with climate change, it isn't really happening. Instead, he might listen to the experts and just get the job done.

Full text: MAJOR FIRES and SYDNEY FORECASTS joined to story.
Fire authorities are preparing themselves for a new wave of bushfires as the weather bureau forecast rising temperatures that would last until the weekend.
While milder weather meant most of the Sydney outbreaks were contained yesterday, bushfires continued to destroy thousands of hectares of national parks and State forests.
More than 150 fires were still burning throughout NSW last night, 80 of them uncontrolled, but the Rural Fire Service was confident most would be quickly extinguished.
Major outbreaks were reported around Merriwa, Muswellbrook, Singleton, andthe Hawkesbury. Other fires were raging north of Coonabarabran and in the Wollon-dilly shire near Nattai andLake Burragorang.
Last night, Commissioner Phil Koperberg of the Rural Fire Service said a spate of fires had started near Inverell, and there was an unconfirmed report that volunteer firefighters from Tamworth were being called away from the Pilliga blaze to fight fires back in their home shire.
The Rural Fire Service said it wanted to put out fires near houses before it gets hotter tomorrow.
Bulldozers were cutting containment lines in a bid to stop a fire north of Lithgow from joining another blaze at Yarramun Creek, which would threaten Bell and Mt Wilson townships.
Fires in Linden and the Jamieson Valley, where two volunteer firefighters were killed on Tuesday, were considered to be safe yesterday afternoon.
A giant trench, 50km long and 20 metres wide, was bulldozed outside the Pilliga scrub blaze, which has burnt out 175,000 hectares. The most serious front was moving towards Narrabri and Boggabri, forcing the evacuation of 10 to 20 properties.
Unlike the southern fires, there has been no weather respite, and it continues to be fanned by gusty winds and temperatures in the mid-30s, which will worsen until an expected change on Sunday.
Residents of Menai returned to their fire-ravaged suburb, where 11 homes were destroyed and up to 30 houses damaged. Eight helicopters water-bombed spot fires in the Sutherland shire, which has lost 3,100 hectares to fires.Fires were being contained yesterday in Engadine, Lucas Heights, Illawong, Alfords Point, Sandy Point, West Menai, and at Heathcote in the Royal
National Park.
The Insurance Council of Australia estimated an insurance bill in Sydney of between $5 million and $10 million.
Commissioner Koperberg said: "We suspect that byFriday we're going to go back into a fairly bad day withvery strong possibilities of strong north-westerlies, high temperatures and low humidity."The Premier, Mr Carr, visited Lithgow and Wallerawang, which were mourning their dead, and Menai.
He pledged the immediate construction of a $30 million bridge spanning the Woronora River, following advice from Commissioner Koperberg that firefighters were hamperedby poor access.

Vagueness is credo of High Priest of the Carbon Club Lobbyists on both sides of the argument have gathered in Kyoto this week for the crucial summit on climate change. Frank McDonald, Environment Correspondent, describes the cast of characters who populate this circuit: [CITY EDITION]

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/vagueness-is-credo-high-priest-carbon-club/docview/310242989/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Every United Nations conference on global warming since the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro - and there have been eight such meetings so far - is populated by the same cast of characters. They haunt the corridors and the lobbies, buttonholing delegates to find out what's happening and to put forward their points of view. These characters on the climate-change circuit range across the spectrum from Dr Jeremy Leggett, science director of Greenpeace International, who wants action on the issue, to Mr Donald Pearlman, a US lawyer, and his allies in the Global Climate Coalition of oil, coal and motor industry interests, who always seek to block progress. A profile in Der Spiegel during the 1995 First Conference of the Parties to the UN Climate Change Convention in Berlin memorably described this publicity-shy lawyer as the "High Priest of the Carbon Club" and said his aim was to "ensure that climate protection negotiations end in the nevernever land of vague declarations."

Full text: Every United Nations conference on global warming since the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro - and there have been eight such meetings so far - is populated by the same cast of characters. They haunt the corridors and the lobbies, buttonholing delegates to find out what's happening and to put forward their points of view.
These characters on the climate-change circuit range across the spectrum from Dr Jeremy Leggett, science director of Greenpeace International, who wants action on the issue, to Mr Donald Pearlman, a US lawyer, and his allies in the Global Climate Coalition of oil, coal and motor industry interests, who always seek to block progress.
Not many people have heard of Mr Pearlman, though his influence has been enormous. He has never missed a meeting and is believed to have read every single line of well over 1,000 UN documents on climate change.
Clients of his Washington law firm, Patton, Boggs and Blow, include such industrial giants as DuPont, Exxon, Shell and Texaco.
A profile in Der Spiegel during the 1995 First Conference of the Parties to the UN Climate Change Convention in Berlin memorably described this publicity-shy lawyer as the "High Priest of the Carbon Club" and said his aim was to "ensure that climate protection negotiations end in the nevernever land of vague declarations."
Negotiations under the convention work on the basis of consensus: everyone has to agree on a text before it can be adopted. This inherent weakness in the process has been exploited over and over again by the fossil fuel lobby, and Mr Pearlman in particular, to weaken the wording of both scientific and political documents.
As one leading environmentalist put it, "He is there arguing over individual words in the text, watering down the science so there are more uncertainties . . . Having succeeded in this ploy, his lobby can and do argue at the next meeting and all the ones afterwards that the science is uncertain and therefore it is too early to take action."
He "systematically uses" delegates from the Gulf states, Der Spiegel said, to "undermine the credibility of scientists" at meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They "engage in endless hair-splitting" and, at one stage, a Kuwaiti delegate even submitted, in Mr Pearlman's handwriting, proposals to change the text.
The US fossil fuel industry, which Mr Pearlman so assiduously represents, has spent millions of dollars in recent years on what the Worldwatch Institute in Washington regards as a "disinformation" campaign to prevent President Clinton taking action on climate change.
Yet Greenpeace is not without allies. Its biggest coup, engineered by Dr Leggett, was to persuade significant elements of the world's insurance industry to climb on board.
What Dr Leggett set out to do was to create a counter-lobby, which would become as important as the coal and oil industry group in pulling the other way. He began talking to insurers, telling them that the thousands of claims from householders with subsiding houses built on London clay were "merely the tip of the global warming iceberg."
Paul Brown, author of a definitive book on climate change, notes that between 1975 and 1993 Britain's bill for subsidence totalled (pounds) 2.5 billion. Problems began mainly in the long dry summer of 1976 but were repeated in the 1980s.
Yet another crop of claims emerged as a result of the very hot and dry 1995 summer. The ground underneath these houses was quite literally cracking up.
Many of the damaged houses were Victorian which had stood on clay foundations for 100 years, yet over the spread of a few years thousands required major repairs.
No wonder insurance companies have introduced a differential premium for houses built on clay; this is "England's first global warming insurance premium," as Paul Brown called it.
It was Greenpeace's 1994 report, The Climate Time Bomb, detailing a huge number of natural disasters worldwide, that made the insurance industry sit up and take notice. In the US alone, 21 of the largest 25 insured catastrophes on record occurred in the past 10 years, and 16 of the 25 involved a combination of wind and water.
The league table for 1992 and 1993 included Hurricane Andrew in the US ((pounds) 16.7 billion), flooding in the US Midwest ((pounds) 8 billion), gales in the US, Canada, Cuba and Mexico ((pounds) 3.3 billion), Cyclone Iniki in Hawaii ((pounds) 1.7 billion), flooding in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands ((pounds) 1.3 billion) and Typhoon Polly in China ((pounds) 1 billion).
Dr Leggett, who assembled insurance executives for a press briefing at the 1995 Berlin conference, said later: "The worst case for insurers is very bad indeed. I have now been personally told by people at the top of the industry, in Munich, Zurich, London, New York and Tokyo that climate change could bankrupt the industry."
The fossil fuel lobby's biggest ally is public apathy. Public interest in "saving the world" has waned quite perceptibly since the Earth Summit. The issue is seen by ordinary people as too complex and the solutions too difficult to contemplate.
But Chancellor Helmut Kohl put it up to us in 1995 when he said: "Preserving Creation and securing sustainable development is a task for the whole of mankind, a task which no one, no state, no economy and no individual, must shirk."

Abstract: Representatives of more than 140 countries are meeting in Kyoto, Japan, to negotiate a treaty limiting emissions of "greenhouse gases," chiefly carbon dioxide, which may cause severe global warming in the next century. The delegates will announce emission goals for 2010, unaccompanied by legislation for reaching them, which is just as well. If such legislation were enacted, the world economy would likely experience a recession comparable to those produced by the oil shocks of the 1970s. How seriously can we take these pledges? Consider that these are the same countries that pledged at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to hold down their emissions -- and then did nothing about it. Instead, as the table nearby shows, all are heading for 2010 emission rates well above 1990 levels. Among the developed nations only Australia (a large coal exporter) is unwilling to play the game of posturing for drastic emissions cuts. But the developing countries, which see consuming more carbon-containing fuels as essential for their economies, aren't making any promises either. Some environmentalists assert that emissions can be reduced by such large amounts quite cheaply. They are dreaming. There simply is no way to cut 25% of our emissions without shutting down many electricity-generating and steel-making plants that use coal and without drastically scaling back gasoline use. Closing one in four of these plants and cutting oil consumption by one-fourth over the next decade means throwing away a good deal of capital stock. New technologies, such as improved fuel cells for autos and dramatically more efficient appliances, may eventually make it possible to cut emissions drastically. But few will be available by 2010. The automobile firm doing the most to promote fuel cells, Daimler Benz, doesn't plans to introduce its first cars with them until 2005.

Full text: Representatives of more than 140 countries are meeting in Kyoto, Japan, to negotiate a treaty limiting emissions of "greenhouse gases," chiefly carbon dioxide, which may cause severe global warming in the next century. The delegates will announce emission goals for 2010, unaccompanied by legislation for reaching them, which is just as well. If such legislation were enacted, the world economy would likely experience a recession comparable to those produced by the oil shocks of the 1970s.
The delegates from the European Union will declare that their goal is to reduce the industrialized nations' emissions 15% below the 1990 level; the Japanese will aim for a 5% reduction. The U.S. will be criticized as a laggard; it will aim only to match the 1990 level.
How seriously can we take these pledges? Consider that these are the same countries that pledged at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to hold down their emissions -- and then did nothing about it. Instead, as the table nearby shows, all are heading for 2010 emission rates well above 1990 levels. Among the developed nations only Australia (a large coal exporter) is unwilling to play the game of posturing for drastic emissions cuts. But the developing countries, which see consuming more carbon-containing fuels as essential for their economies, aren't making any promises either.
Attaining even the U.S. proposal, the most modest of these goals, would be very costly. Getting back to 1990, as the Clinton administration proposes to do, means doing whatever it takes over 13 years to make Americans put out at least one-fourth less carbon dioxide than they otherwise would. That translates into a loss to the economy of at least 3% to 4% of gross domestic product, a proportion that could easily rise if, as seems likely, regulators fail to make the reductions in an efficient way. Higher unemployment would be a near certainty; so would inflation, if the Federal Reserve tried to compensate for the slowdown through an expansive monetary policy, as it did in the 1970s.
Some environmentalists assert that emissions can be reduced by such large amounts quite cheaply. They are dreaming. There simply is no way to cut 25% of our emissions without shutting down many electricity-generating and steel-making plants that use coal and without drastically scaling back gasoline use. Closing one in four of these plants and cutting oil consumption by one-fourth over the next decade means throwing away a good deal of capital stock. New technologies, such as improved fuel cells for autos and dramatically more efficient appliances, may eventually make it possible to cut emissions drastically. But few will be available by 2010. The automobile firm doing the most to promote fuel cells, Daimler Benz, doesn't plans to introduce its first cars with them until 2005.
Europe's and Japan's plans are no more realistic than the U.S.'s. True, Europe has the lowest projected rate of growth in emissions from 1990-2010 -- but that mostly reflects Germany's closure of the inefficient energy complex in the east and Britain's substitution of natural gas for coal. And the costs of reducing Japan's emissions would make that country's current economic troubles seem mild by comparison.
There is a cynical explanation of the implausible goals Europe and Japan have announced: They are counting on inaction by the U.S., the biggest producer of greenhouse gases. In July the U.S. Senate -- which must ratify any treaty drafted at Kyoto -- voted 95-0 in favor of a nonbinding resolution calling on the Clinton administration not to sign any treaty whose requirements do not apply to the developing countries. Knowing this, European and Japanese officials are able to pander to their environmentalist constituents now and point to U.S. inaction to get them off the hook later. China, India and others in the developing world will follow suit.
The Clinton administration, which is dispatching Vice President Gore to Kyoto, is posturing too. It has offered a meager package that will not do much by 2010: some kind of tax credit for firms that cut emissions, trading of emission rights, more research and development on energy technologies, and solar roofs on 20,000 government buildings. Total cost: $5 billion over five years.
The package includes good, bad and promising ideas. One that looks bad is offering tax concessions to encourage use of cleaner energy, a scheme likely to require a costly auditing system.
A more promising idea is setting up a trading system for greenhouse gases, similar to the current system that allocates rights to emit sulfur oxides among U.S. coal-fired power plants; it has cut costs about 85% below that of a nontrading system of control. Such a system cuts overall emissions while allowing the market to determine the most efficient way of accomplishing the reduction.
Ultimately we might see international trading of emission rights, though this idea needs a lot more work. Emission rights would have to be apportioned among nations in the first place, entailing negotiation on a cosmic scale. As economist Thomas Schelling argues, the $1 trillion or so in present value involved is simply too large for politicians to commit. And, in laudable pursuit of the least global cost, it could lead to huge transfers of money to less developed countries, which couldn't be used for anything other than energy projects. Still, the U.S. and other industrial countries might experiment by setting up trading systems domestically, with relatively nonbinding permit levels at the outset, with the aim of going international when the time is ripe.
Increasing R&D on noncarbon technologies is the only clearly good idea in the president's package. If global warming becomes severe, there will be an urgent need for such technologies. Most will take decades to develop and deploy on a wide scale; this is the time to start, and the cost would be far less than drastically scaling back emissions soon.
The oil shocks of the 1970s stimulated research on alternative energy sources. Some turned out badly, notably the nuclear breeder reactor and synthetic fuels, but others were more successful, especially the solar-photovoltaic programs. The president's science and technology advisers have recommended spending about $800 million a year more on greenhouse-related research, an increase that would bring such spending back about to its level in 1991. The chance of government failures could be held down by promoting private sector consortia, by keeping most projects small and by sharing costs with the private sector. But some government involvement is necessary, since private firms are unwilling to take certain risks on their own. What company would try to develop a new nuclear reactor?
The Rio-Kyoto enterprise brings to mind Ambrose Bierce's definition of a fanatic: one who redoubles his efforts as he loses sight of his goal. Environmentalists are damaging their cause by focusing on the unattainable while neglecting the useful and feasible. The strategy of committing to an emissions target and having nations pay whatever the bill comes to has things backward. Instead, these countries should be trying to identify useful actions with known costs while accepting whatever benefits in greenhouse-gas reductions result. More R&D fits this approach, because the budget can be controlled and the new technology can be used world-wide. So does starting some experiments in trading emission permits. These actions amount to buying "insurance" at a known cost against uncertain future risks.
The delegates to Kyoto will declare victory, but their claim will be hollow. But perhaps this meeting will be the last run of the Greenhouse Follies, followed by a process that accomplishes something useful.

Financial interests fiddle while our habitat burns: [Final Edition]

Abstract: The haze is gone from Malaysia now, but the cabaret group `Instant Cafe' is still getting a lot of mileage out of it. They were playing a corporate function in Kuala Lumpur last weekend -- people who'd coughed and wept their way through the haze for all of September and October -- and the audience rocked with laughter when they did their song Haze: The haze is mostly smoke from the thousands of forest fires that are set in Indonesia every dry season: first you log out any commercially valuable trees, then you burn the rest because that's the cheapest way to clear the land for cultivation. The smoke from huge areas of burning forest drifts blocks out the sun and causing respiratory disorders. Without a serious American offer on cutting emissions, none of the other hold-outs at Kyoto will be under any pressure to yield, for the U.S. is the most flagrant polluter of all (four per cent of the world's population, 24 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions). So the best that can be hoped for at Kyoto is dramatic failure.

Full text: The UN Climate Summit which opened in Kyoto, Japan yesterday will probably not end in a flaming row. Countries must not lose face, and so they are more likely to cobble together some shoddy compromise that is worth nothing. But a spectacular failure would be much better, for at least it might get the donkey's attention.
Or more precisely, the frog's attention. Environmentalists often compare human behaviour to that of frogs -- who, if you drop them into a pot of boiling water, will jump right out again and survive. But sit a frog in a pot of cool water, raise the heat gradually, and he'll sit there happily until he boils to death.
Are humans really like frogs? Of course they are. Take Malaysians, for example.
The haze is gone from Malaysia now, but the cabaret group `Instant Cafe' is still getting a lot of mileage out of it. They were playing a corporate function in Kuala Lumpur last weekend -- people who'd coughed and wept their way through the haze for all of September and October -- and the audience rocked with laughter when they did their song Haze:
"Come and visit Malaysia.
Come and stay for lots of days.
You don't need your suntan lotion.
You'll be safe from UV rays.
No need to sunbathe by the ocean.
Get dark by strolling in our haze."
The haze is mostly smoke from the thousands of forest fires that are set in Indonesia every dry season: first you log out any commercially valuable trees, then you burn the rest because that's the cheapest way to clear the land for cultivation. The smoke from huge areas of burning forest drifts blocks out the sun and causing respiratory disorders.
The haze was particularly bad in 1991, when the eruption of Mount Pinatubo added extra ash to the atmosphere. It was even worse this year because of the prolonged drought caused by El Nino. But it happens every year, and it will go on happening until the region's rain forests are all gone. (At the current loss rate of around three per cent per year, that will be around 30 years from now.)
Yet few Malaysians think they can do anything about it, because they know that the companies that are setting most of the fires in Indonesia have close links with President Suharto's government in Jakarta, and generally get their way.
They are also vaguely aware that destroying the forests raises the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming. But that problem isn't affecting their daily lives yet, and they have lots of present worries to keep them busy.
People in large industrialized democracies like the United States like to think they are different: better information, more open societies, a more educated public. But in fact they are equally captive to special interest groups.
The United States, for example, promised at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio to cut its carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Instead, U.S. carbon emissions are 13 per cent higher than in 1990, and Washington is now saying that it can't get back down to the target figure until 2013. What happened?
The Clinton administration knows what it should do. At a preparatory meeting of the climate change conference in Geneva earlier this year, the U.S. mobilized the world's big insurance companies, who proved that global warming was already hitting their balance sheets in terms of soaring claims for storm damage.
That debunked the `junk science' (paid for by fossil-fuel producers) that pretends global warming is just an unproven hypothesis. With the European Union offering emission cuts to 15 per cent below 1990 levels by 2010, and the U.S. government also apparently on board, success in Kyoto seemed within reach.
True, the Australians, who export a lot of coal, were arguing that there should be no common global target, just individual targets tailored to individual countries' situations (agree to that, and you will spend the next century in negotiations.)
Some oil-rich states were even insisting that if the world cut back on fossil-fuel use, they must be compensated financially. But it was clear that once the U.S. openly espoused a tough target for cutting emissions, a lot of the resistance would crumble.
What went wrong? Basically, Clinton belatedly realized that U.S. fossil-fuel producers, in alliance with other major industries that worry about higher energy costs, control enough U.S. senators to block any treaty that hurts their interests. So rather than fight a hopeless battle, he has chosen pre-emptive surrender.
Just as in Jakarta, the tail is wagging the dog. Many more Americans have an interest in curbing global warming than in the industries that cause it, but the majority is less conscious of its interests: the water in the pot is getting hotter, but only gradually. So the prospective victims exert less political pressure, and the other side gets its way.
Without a serious American offer on cutting emissions, none of the other hold-outs at Kyoto will be under any pressure to yield, for the U.S. is the most flagrant polluter of all (four per cent of the world's population, 24 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions). So the best that can be hoped for at Kyoto is dramatic failure.
The Europeans should stick to their 15-per-cent cuts proposal and make no compromises. They won't get their way, but that will at least ensure that the problem isn't shelved for five years after a cynical deal that leaves everyone free to do whatever they want.
Complete failure would at least make everybody come back for another conference next year. In the meantime, we should pray for weather so extreme that it wakes the frogs up.

The "haze" is mostly smoke from the thousands of forest fires that are set in Indonesia every dry season: first you log out any commercially valuable trees, then you burn the rest because that's the cheapest way to clear the land for cultivation.
The smoke from huge areas of burning forest drifts over neighbouring Malaysia, blocking out the sun and causing respiratory disorders.

Are humans really like frogs? Of course they are. Take Malaysians, for example.
The haze is gone from Malaysia now, but the cabaret group ``Instant Cafe'' is still getting mileage out of it. They were playing a corporate function in Kuala Lumpur last month -- for people who'd coughed and wept their way through the haze for all of September and October -- and the audience rocked with laughter when they did their ``Haze'' song.
The ``haze'' is mostly smoke from the thousands of forest fires that are set in Indonesia every dry season: First, you log out any commercially valuable trees, then you burn the rest because that's the cheapest way to clear the land for cultivation. The smoke from huge areas of burning forest drifts over neighboring Malaysia, blocking out the sun and causing respiratory disorders.
Yet few Malaysians think they can do anything about it, because they know that the companies that are setting most of the fires in Indonesia have close links with President Suharto's government in Jakarta and generally get their way.
People in large industrialized democracies like the United States like to think they are different: better information, more open societies, a more educated public. But, in fact, they are equally captive to special interest groups.
The United States, for example, promised at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio to cut its carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Instead, U.S. carbon emissions are 13 percent higher than in 1990, and Washington is now saying it can't get back down to the target figure until 2013. What happened?
The Clinton administration knows what it should do. At a preparatory meeting of the climate change conference in Geneva earlier this year, the United States mobilized the world's big insurance companies, who proved that global warming was already hitting their balance sheets in terms of soaring claims for storm damage.
That debunked the ``junk science'' (paid for by fossil-fuel producers) that pretends global warming is just an unproven hypothesis. With the European Union offering emission cuts to 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010 and the U.S. also apparently on board, success in Kyoto seemed within reach.
What went wrong? Basically, Clinton belatedly realized that U.S. fossil-fuel producers, in alliance with other major industries that worry about higher energy costs, control enough U.S. senators to block any treaty that hurts their interests. So rather than fight a hopeless battle, he has chosen pre-emptive surrender.
Just as in Jakarta, the tail is wagging the dog. Many more Americans have an interest in curbing global warming than in the industries that cause it, but the majority is less conscious of its interests: The water in the pot is getting hotter, but only gradually. So the prospective victims exert less political pressure, and the other side gets its way.
Without a serious American offer on cutting emissions, none of the other holdouts at Kyoto will be under any pressure to yield, for the U.S. is the most flagrant polluter of all (4 percent of the world's population, 24 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions). So the best that can be hoped for at Kyoto is dramatic failure.
The Europeans should stick to their 15 percent cuts proposal and make no compromises. They won't get their way, but that will at least ensure that the problem isn't shelved for five years after a cynical deal that leaves everyone free to do whatever they want.
Complete failure would at least make everybody come back for another conference next year. In the meantime, we should pray for weather so extreme that it wakes the frogs up.Gwynne Dyer is a London-based independent journalist whose articles are published in 35 countries.

Abstract: The debate over global warming is almost as hot as the global climate. Top scientists are convinced burning fossil fuels -- oil, coal and gas -- raises the levels of greenhouse gases. These gases - - carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane -- build in the atmosphere, trapping heat that should escape into outer space. And so we slowly cook in our own juices. A new study says this year is the warmest since records were first made in 1860. Hot enough for you? How lucky do we feel? The European Community is convinced about global warming, enough to call for a 15 per cent reduction in greenhouse gases. Another group worth heeding is the insurance industry. Hardly a cadre of radical-chic greens, these business people believe global warming is causing unprecedented damage and rising claims.

Full text: The world is heating up, if not yet burning, but until Monday, the Canadian government was as content as Nero to fiddle. Then, as delegates from 150 nations met in Kyoto, Japan, to find a way to put a damper on climate change, Canada did the right thing and changed its tune.
The Liberal government is now calling for a three per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2010. This is a significant change by an administration that until now stressed merely stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels.
The change is especially welcome since it signals the government, after dithering for too long, is serious about this issue and agrees the problem exists. People must know this. They will bear some pain before the Earth's wounds are healed.
The debate over global warming is almost as hot as the global climate. Top scientists are convinced burning fossil fuels -- oil, coal and gas -- raises the levels of greenhouse gases. These gases - - carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane -- build in the atmosphere, trapping heat that should escape into outer space. And so we slowly cook in our own juices. A new study says this year is the warmest since records were first made in 1860. Hot enough for you?
Skeptics argue the case is unproven, pointing out that the Earth's climate fluctuates naturally and that reliable records are recent creations. So who should be trusted?
Perhaps we should just hedge our bets. The risk of doing nothing and creating a global disaster is far more serious than the risk of taking unnecessary steps that temporarily hurt economies. Do we want to bequeath to our grandchildren a wrecked planet devastated by floods, storms and farmland turned to desert, or a slightly slower economy?
How lucky do we feel? The European Community is convinced about global warming, enough to call for a 15 per cent reduction in greenhouse gases. Another group worth heeding is the insurance industry. Hardly a cadre of radical-chic greens, these business people believe global warming is causing unprecedented damage and rising claims.
At this point, Canadians, the world's second largest per capita producers of greenhouse gases, are finally getting badly needed clarity and direction from their leaders. Now the government has to tell us how we can get there by outlining its incentives, regulations and plans for alternative technology. We have been warned enough about a storm building on the horizon. We should act, while there's time.

Until Payoff Is Clear, Haste Means Big Waste

Abstract: To the frustration of environmental activists, the still-distant risks from global warming have yet to grab the attention of Main Street. But to many economists, the difficulty in mobilizing public support to meet America's international commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 may yet prove a blessing. For while some of the skepticism about the virtue of quick, decisive action is coming from the energy and auto industries, most independent experts also urge a long, hard look before we leap. William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University, estimates that bribing or bullying the developing world to switch to energy-saving, carbon-sparing technologies -- things like insulating buildings and generating electricity with natural gas rather than coal -- would get the job done for one-ninth the cost of squeezing comparable emissions out of the developed economies. His computer simulations suggest that cutting emissions in the United States back to 1990 levels by 2010 would require a doubling of energy prices, ''more than the price run-up during the two oil crises,'' he noted. Economists also note that while the debate in Kyoto is about annual levels of emissions, what matters in terms of climate change is the accumulated levels of greenhouse gases. Alan Manne of Stanford University and Richard Richels of the Electric Power Research Institute, a research organization in Palo Alto, Calif., that is supported by the power industry, compare two paths to stabilizing atmospheric carbon at 550 parts per million, double preindustrial levels, around the end of the 21st century. With the rapid transition mandated by current international agreements, annual emissions would peak at seven billion tons around 2050. But on a cost-minimizing path, the emissions would peak at 10 billion tons but then fall more rapidly to achieve the same atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gas. Taking the faster route to the same end would double the cost, adding a trillion dollars to the ultimate bill. ''So much depends,'' Dr. Richels said, ''on what we call 'when flexibility.' ''

Full text: WHAT, Americans worry?
To the frustration of environmental activists, the still-distant risks from global warming have yet to grab the attention of Main Street. But to many economists, the difficulty in mobilizing public support to meet America's international commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 may yet prove a blessing. For while some of the skepticism about the virtue of quick, decisive action is coming from the energy and auto industries, most independent experts also urge a long, hard look before we leap.
To be sure, there may well be easy opportunities to slow global warming through bottom-up steps like better insulation and modest changes in agricultural methods.
But crash programs, most economists argue, are apt to increase the cost of containing emissions without increasing the benefits. More important, they question the logic of diverting vast economic resources from other uses without a better understanding of the payoff. ''The most effective policy won't be the most dramatic,'' cautioned Robert N. Stavins, an environmental economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
The economists' immediate concern is the difficulty of slowing emissions without support from China, India, Brazil and a half-dozen other big emerging economies. While Europe, America and Japan are heavy emitters of greenhouse gases, it's widely agreed that the cheap fixes lie elsewhere.
William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University, estimates that bribing or bullying the developing world to switch to energy-saving, carbon-sparing technologies -- things like insulating buildings and generating electricity with natural gas rather than coal -- would get the job done for one-ninth the cost of squeezing comparable emissions out of the developed economies. His computer simulations suggest that cutting emissions in the United States back to 1990 levels by 2010 would require a doubling of energy prices, ''more than the price run-up during the two oil crises,'' he noted.
Just as costly as doing it in the wrong place would be doing it at the wrong pace. A blitzkrieg on emissions, compared with a more deliberate effort to pick the low-hanging fruit first, would require that relatively new carbon-emitting capital -- power plants, industrial equipment and vehicles -- be scrapped rather than replaced gradually. And it would force countries, companies and consumers to adopt exotic greenhouse-friendly technologies like fuel cells before they are fully worked out -- or fully affordable. No less important, a rapid transition would tie up capital that could otherwise be used to increase productive capacity.
A hundred billion here, a hundred billion there could add up to real money.
Economists also note that while the debate in Kyoto is about annual levels of emissions, what matters in terms of climate change is the accumulated levels of greenhouse gases. Alan Manne of Stanford University and Richard Richels of the Electric Power Research Institute, a research organization in Palo Alto, Calif., that is supported by the power industry, compare two paths to stabilizing atmospheric carbon at 550 parts per million, double preindustrial levels, around the end of the 21st century. With the rapid transition mandated by current international agreements, annual emissions would peak at seven billion tons around 2050. But on a cost-minimizing path, the emissions would peak at 10 billion tons but then fall more rapidly to achieve the same atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gas. Taking the faster route to the same end would double the cost, adding a trillion dollars to the ultimate bill. ''So much depends,'' Dr. Richels said, ''on what we call 'when flexibility.' ''
If the issues of where and when emissions should be curbed give policy wonks reason to pause, they pale in importance beside the core question: How much is climate stabilization really worth?
Sharp, rapid increases in temperature might transform the biosphere in catastrophic ways, conceivably threatening human survival. But the pace and amount of warming that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change now views as most likely -- an average increase of about four degrees Fahrenheit by 2060, with an increase in rainfall of 7 percent and a one-foot rise in sea level -- suggest a different story.
According to the most plausible computer simulations, the economic impact on the temperate zones would be relatively small; increases in agricultural productivity could more than offset the added costs from storm damage and coastal flooding. Canada and Russia could be big winners, as their growing seasons lengthen and heating bills fall. Even the United States might come out ahead: Robert Mendelsohn, an economist at Yale, estimates that output would increase by $37 billion.
The picture is far more dire for the poor, predominantly agricultural tropics, vulnerable to flooding, drought and epidemics. But in a world of limited resources, and limited generosity, Thomas Schelling, an economist at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, argues that it would make more sense to divert the sums needed to curb global warming into investments that mitigate poverty in the developing world.
''They have more immediate environmental problems -- sanitation, congestion, disease -- that demand prior attention,'' he said. ''Their best defense against climate is their own development.''
Many economists who are sanguine about the likely consequences of unchecked temperature increases would still recommend buying some insurance against less likely catastrophe scenarios -- for example, the possibility that the melting of polar ice could liberate trapped methane and lead to runaway warming. But they insist that it would be irrational to throw big sums at risks this remote. Dr. Nordhaus, the Yale economist, said, ''I've seen nothing that justified increasing the wholesale price of energy by more than 10 percent,'' roughly a nickel a gallon at the gasoline pump.
In light of both President Clinton's reluctance to do much without the participation of the developing world and the resistance of Congress to any increases in energy prices, the hurdles to any consensus on swift action appear formidable. That will please analysts who see nothing good coming from on-again, off-again hysteria over climate warming. But it worries Dr. Nordhaus, who wonders how we will ever learn to walk without a few baby steps.
''Let's do something modest,'' Dr. Nordhaus urged, ''but let's really do it.''
Chart ''The Cost of Reducing Emissions''
While there is general agreement that heat-trapping gases are on the rise, there is little agreement about how much it will cost to reduce emissions. Studies on the costs vary widely based on a number of factors including: the emissions goal; when that goal must be achieved; whether rights to emit gases are tradable; whether taxes are imposed on emissions and how the revenue from such taxes are used; and the depth of society's desire to meet the target.
Some studies look at reductions from the top down, trying to predict how changes in one sector of the economy will effect everything else. These models generally predict that there will be some sort of economic cost. Bottom up studies examine the economy sector by sector, looking for ways to increase efficiency. These models tend to predict overall economic benefits. Here are examples of studies that illustrate each perspective.
TOP DOWN
ORGANIZATIONS -- Stanford Univ., Electric Power Research Institute
APPROACH -- Uses bottom up for where energy comes from and top down for the rest of the econaomy
GOAL -- Atmospheric carbon levels of 550 parts per million, double the pre-industrial level.
CONCLUSION -- The most important factors in keeping the cost of reductions down are phasing them in slowly and allowing trading of emissions rights.
COMMENT -- Richard Richels, one of the study's authors, says that some pure bottom up studies underestimate the hidden costs of switching technologies to reduce emissions. For example, he says there are more fuel efficient cars than Volvos, but consumers buy Volvos because of their reputation for safety.
Chart tracks annual emissions levels for stabilizing carbon dioxide concentrations at 550 parts per million, from 1990 through 2100. It also shows worldwide cost of stabilizing carbon dioxide concentrations, based on 1990 investment cost
BOTTOM UP
ORGANIZATION -- Five national labs of the Department of Energy
APPROACH -- Bottom up
GOAL -- Reduce emissions by 2010, if possible to 1990 levels
CONCLUSION -- Energy savings would offset additional investments needed to reduce emissions so that net costs to the U.S. economy are estimated to be near or below zero.
COMMENT -- The study looks at two methods to reduce emissions: promoting energy efficiency and imposing a tax on emissions of carbon.

Global warming conference needs 'act of courage:' Annan: [Final Edition]

Abstract: Such controls over carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could, in turn, begin to forestall the damaging rises in temperatures, sea levels and severe weather that scientists predict from global warming. At the 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil, the world's nations signed a Climate Change Treaty that, because of U.S. opposition, set only a voluntary goal: reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. The underlying principle of climate change is undisputed: Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and a few other gases, mostly from fuel combustion, are pervious to incoming sunlight, but trap the heat that Earth emits back to space.

Full text: Representatives of 150 nations are converging on this city of ancient temples to negotiate a 21st-century insurance policy for the planet, a deal to control energy use to protect the atmosphere against global warming.
The talks are highly technical and complex, and the politics challenging.
"There are times when only an act of courage can spur progress in world affairs," UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a statement wishing the conference success as it opens Monday.
If successful, the 10 days of negotiations could lead to shifts toward new-technology automobiles and fuel-saving driving habits, away from coal-powered electricity plants, and toward new farming and forestry practices.
Such controls over carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could, in turn, begin to forestall the damaging rises in temperatures, sea levels and severe weather that scientists predict from global warming.
Powerful opposition has developed against early action, especially among oil-producing countries and U.S. coal, oil and other interests likely to be hurt.
Industry lobbyists are among the thousands of diplomats, scientists, environmentalists and journalists assembling in Japan's old capital.
At the 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil, the world's nations signed a Climate Change Treaty that, because of U.S. opposition, set only a voluntary goal: reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000.
The underlying principle of climate change is undisputed: Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and a few other gases, mostly from fuel combustion, are pervious to incoming sunlight, but trap the heat that Earth emits back to space.
Environmentalists say that even a degree more warming could be damaging, flooding much of low-lying, overcrowded Bangladesh, for example.
And the worst-case scenario could be calamitous for everyone, said Michael Oppenheimer of the U.S. Environmental Defence Fund.
