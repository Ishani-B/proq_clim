Abstract: Violent weather has cost the world a record $89 billion this year, more money than was lost from weather-related disasters in all of the 1980s, and, in a study released Friday, researchers blame human meddling for much of it. Preliminary estimates by the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research group, and Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, put total losses from storms, floods, droughts and fires for the first 11 months of the year 48 percent higher than the previous one-year record of more than $60 billion in 1996. This year's damage also far surpassed the $55 billion in losses for the entire decade of the 1980s.

Full text: Violent weather has cost the world a record $89 billion this year, more money than was lost from weather-related disasters in all of the 1980s, and, in a study released Friday, researchers blame human meddling for much of it.
Preliminary estimates by the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research group, and Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, put total losses from storms, floods, droughts and fires for the first 11 months of the year 48 percent higher than the previous one-year record of more than $60 billion in 1996.
This year's damage also far surpassed the $55 billion in losses for the entire decade of the 1980s.
Even when adjusted for inflation, the 1980s losses, at $82.7 billion, still fall short of the first 11 months of this year.
In addition to the material losses, the disasters have killed an estimated 32,000 people and displaced 300 million, according to the report.
Munich Re writes policies that protect insurance companies from the risk of massive claims that might put them out of business.
The report says a combination of deforestation and climate change has caused this year's most severe disasters, among them Hurricane Mitch, the flooding of China's Yangtze River and Bangladesh's most extensive flood of the century.
Dunn said that, when hillsides are left bare, rainfall will rush across the land or into rivers without being slowed by trees and allowed to be absorbed by the soil or evaporate back into the atmosphere.
This leads to floods and landslides that are strong enough to wipe out roads, farms and fisheries far downstream.
"In a sense, we're turning up the faucets . . . and throwing away the sponges, like the forests and the wetlands," said Dunn.
Another element that has contributed to this year's losses is the growing population pressures that have led many people to settle on vulnerable flood plains and hillsides.
The most severe 1998 disasters listed in the report include Hurricane Mitch, the deadliest Atlantic storm in 200 years, which has caused more than 10,000 deaths in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Mitch caused damage estimated at $4 billion in Honduras and $1 billion in Nicaragua.
The study said Mitch hit an ecologically vulnerable region. Central American nations have experienced some of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, said the study.
The costliest disaster of 1998, according to the report, was the flooding of the Yangtze River in the summer.
It killed more than 3,000 people, dislocated about 230 million people and incurred $30 billion in losses.

Saturday, November 28, 1998
Associated Press
Washington -- Violent weather has cost the world a record $130-billion this year -- more money than was lost from weather-related disasters in all of the 1980s -- and researchers in a study released yesterday blame human meddling for much of the loss.
Preliminary estimates by the Worldwatch Institute and Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, put total losses from storms, floods, droughts and fires for the first 11 months of the year 48 per cent higher than the previous one-year record of more than $90-billion in 1996.
This year's damage was also far ahead of the $82-billion in losses for the entire decade of the 1980s. Even when adjusted for inflation, the 1980s losses, at $120-billion, still fall short of the first 11 months of this year.
In addition to the material losses, the disasters have killed an estimated 32,000 people and displaced 300 million -- more than the population of the United States -- the report says.
The study is based on estimates from Worldwatch, an environmental research group, and Munich Re, a German-based reinsurer, which writes policies that protect insurance companies from the risk of massive claims that might put them out of business.
The report says a combination of deforestation and climate change has caused this year's most severe disasters, among them Hurricane Mitch, the flooding of China's Yangtze River and Bangladesh's most extensive flood of the century.
"More and more, there's a human fingerprint in natural disasters in that we're making them more frequent and more intense and we're also . . . making them more destructive," said Seth Dunn, research associate and climate-change expert at the institute.
Mr. Dunn said when hillsides are left bare, rainfall will rush across the land or into rivers without being slowed by trees and allowed to be absorbed by the soil or evaporate back into the atmosphere. This leads to floods and landslides that are strong enough to wipe out roads, farms and fisheries far downstream.
"In a sense, we're turning up the faucets . . . and throwing away the sponges, like the forests and the wetlands," Mr. Dunn said.
The most severe 1998 disasters listed in the report include Hurricane Mitch, which has caused more than 10,000 deaths in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador and has caused damage estimated at $6-billion in Honduras and $1.5-billion in Nicaragua.

Full text:   A study finds "human fingerprints" on weather conditions that caused $89 billion in damage.
WASHINGTON (AP)-- Violent weather has cost the world a record $89 billion this year, more money than was lost from weather-related disasters in all of the 1980s, and researchers in a study released Friday blame human meddling for much of it.
Preliminary estimates by the Worldwatch Institute and Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, put total losses from storms, floods, droughts and fires for the first 11 months of the year 48 percent higher than the previous one-year record of more than $60 billion in 1996.
This year's damage was also far ahead of the $55 billion in losses for the entire decade of the 1980s. Even when adjusted for inflation, the 1980s losses, at $82.7 billion, still fall short of the first 11 months of this year.
In addition to the material losses, the disasters have killed an estimated 32,000 people and displaced 300 million-- more than the population of the United States-- according to the report.
The study is based on estimates from Worldwatch, an environmental research group, and Munich Re, the Frankfurt, Germany-based reinsurer, which writes policies that protect insurance companies from the risk of massive claims that might put them out of business.
The report says a combination of deforestation and climate change has caused this year's most severe disasters, among them Hurricane Mitch, the flooding of China's Yangtze River and Bangladesh's most extensive flood of the century.
"More and more, there's a human fingerprint in natural disasters in that we're making them more frequent and more intense and we're also ... making them more destructive," said Seth Dunn, research associate and climate change expert at the institute.
Dunn said when hillsides are left bare, rainfall will rush across the land or into rivers without being slowed by trees and allowed to be absorbed by the soil or evaporate back into the atmosphere. This leads to floods and landslides that are strong enough to wipe out roads, farms and fisheries far downstream.
"In a sense, we're turning up the faucets ... and throwing away the sponges, like the forests and the wetlands," said Dunn.
Another element that has contributed to this year's losses is the growing population pressures that have led many people to settle on vulnerable flood plains and hillsides.
The most severe 1998 disasters listed in the report include Hurricane Mitch, the deadliest Atlantic storm in 200 years, which has caused more than 10,000 deaths in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador, and caused damage estimated at $4 billion in Honduras and $1 billion in Nicaragua.
The study said Mitch hit an ecologically vulnerable region. Central American nations have experienced some of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, losing some 2 percent to 4 percent of their remaining forest cover each year, said the study.
The costliest disaster of 1998, according to the report, was the flooding of the Yangtze River in the summer. It killed more than 3,000 people, dislocated about 230 million people and incurred $30 billion in losses.
The study said that while heavy summer rains are common in southern and central China, the Yangtze Basin has lost 85 percent of its forest cover to logging and agriculture in recent decades, wetlands have been drained, and the river heavily dammed.
Bangladesh suffered its most extensive flood of the century in the summer. Two-thirds of the low-lying country located at the mouth of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers was flooded for months, 30 million people were left temporarily homeless, and 10,000 miles of roads were heavily damaged. Damage estimates exceed $3.4 billion.
Logging upriver in the Himalayas of north India and Nepal exacerbated the disaster, as did the fact that the region's rivers and flood plains have been filled with silt and constricted by development, according to the report.
"Climate change and rising sea levels are projected to make Bangladesh even more vulnerable to flooding in the future," said the study.
The study said governments are beginning to recognize the role of human activities in worsening natural disasters. It noted that China has banned logging in the upper Yangtze watershed, prohibited additional land reclamation projects in the river's flood plain and earmarked $2 billion to reforest the watershed.
"Unless ravaged nations rebuild along a path of sustainable development that emphasizes restoring and maintaining healthy ecosystems, they risk even greater exposure to the devastation of unnatural disasters in the future," said the report.

Abstract: WASHINGTON - Violent weather has cost the world a record $89 billion this year, more money than was lost from weather-related disasters in all of the 1980s, and researchers in a study released Friday blame human meddling for much of it. Preliminary estimates by the Worldwatch Institute and Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, put total losses from storms, floods, droughts and fires for the first 11 months of the year 48 percent higher than the previous one-year record of more than $60 billion in 1996. This year's damage was also far ahead of the $55 billion in losses for the entire decade of the 1980s. Even when adjusted for inflation, the 1980s losses, at $82.7 billion, still fall short of the first 11 months of this year.

WASHINGTON - Violent weather has cost the world a record $89 billion this year, more money than was lost from weather-related disasters in all of the 1980s, and researchers in a study released Friday blame human meddling for much of it.
Preliminary estimates by the Worldwatch Institute and Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, put total losses from storms, floods, droughts and fires for the first 11 months of the year 48 percent higher than the previous one-year record of more than $60 billion in 1996.
This year's damage was also far ahead of the $55 billion in losses for the entire decade of the 1980s. Even when adjusted for inflation, the 1980s losses, at $82.7 billion, still fall short of the first 11 months of this year.
In addition to the material losses, the disasters have killed an estimated 32,000 people and displaced 300 million - more than the population of the United States - according to the report.
The study is based on estimates from Worldwatch, an environmental research group, and Munich Re, the Frankfurt, Germany-based reinsurer, which writes policies that protect insurance companies from the risk of massive claims that might put them out of business.
The report says a combination of deforestation and climate change has caused this year's most severe disasters, among them Hurricane Mitch, the flooding of China's Yangtze River and Bangladesh's most extensive flood of the century.
"More and more, there's a human fingerprint in natural disasters in that we're making them more frequent and more intense and we're also ... making them more destructive," said Seth Dunn, research associate and climate change expert at the institute.
Dunn said when hillsides are left bare, rainfall will rush across the land or into rivers without being slowed by trees and allowed to be absorbed by the soil or evaporate back into the atmosphere. This leads to floods and landslides that are strong enough to wipe out roads, farms and fisheries far downstream.
"In a sense, we're turning up the faucets ... and throwing away the sponges, like the forests and the wetlands," said Dunn.
Another element that has contributed to this year's losses is the growing population pressures that have led many people to settle on vulnerable flood plains and hillsides.
The most severe 1998 disasters listed in the report include Hurricane Mitch, the deadliest Atlantic storm in 200 years, which has caused more than 10,000 deaths in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador, and caused damage estimated at $4 billion in Honduras and $1 billion in Nicaragua.
The study said Mitch hit an ecologically vulnerable region. Central American nations have experienced some of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, losing some 2 percent to 4 percent of their remaining forest cover each year, said the study.
The costliest disaster of 1998, according to the report, was the flooding of the Yangtze River in the summer. It killed more than 3,000 people, dislocated about 230 million people and incurred $30 billion in losses.
The study said that while heavy summer rains are common in southern and central China, the Yangtze Basin has lost 85 percent of its forest cover to logging and agriculture in recent decades, wetlands have been drained, and the river heavily dammed.
Bangladesh suffered its most extensive flood of the century in the summer. Two-thirds of the low-lying country located at the mouth of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers was flooded for months, 30 million people were left temporarily homeless, and 10,000 miles of roads were heavily damaged. Damage estimates exceed $3.4 billion.
Logging upriver in the Himalayas of north India and Nepal exacerbated the disaster, as did the fact that the region's rivers and flood plains have been filled with silt and constricted by development, according to the report.
"Climate change and rising sea levels are projected to make Bangladesh even more vulnerable to flooding in the future," said the study.
The study said governments are beginning to recognize the role of human activities in worsening natural disasters. It noted that China has banned logging in the upper Yangtze watershed, prohibited additional land reclamation projects in the river's flood plain and earmarked $2 billion to reforest the watershed.
""Unless ravaged nations rebuild along a path of sustainable development that emphasizes restoring and maintaining healthy ecosystems, they risk even greater exposure to the devastation of unnatural disasters in the future," said the report.

Full text:   WASHINGTON - Violent weather has cost the world a record $89 billion this year, more money than was lost from weather-related disasters in all of the 1980s, and researchers in a study released Friday blame human meddling for much of it.

Full text: aGLOBAL climate change is likely to cause floods, droughts and other natural disasters in Scotland and should be dealt with by a distinctly Scottish group of experts, a Government-sponsored report recommends.
The report by the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP), due to be published next week, highlights the need for more political leadership and an integrated research programme.
The Scottish Office is understood to have acted on the latter recommendation and invited tenders from academic groups to carry out the work.
The bids were received this week and an announcement about the successful tender is expected on Monday at a climate change workshop in Edinburgh.
Ministers are also expected to agree to set up a climate change forum - which could include academics, campaigners and public bodies - to advise the Government on Scottish issues.
UKCIP is funded by the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions and already carries out some of those functions for the whole of the UK, but a distinctly Scottish advisory group is seen as necessary to advise Holyrood leaders.
The recommendations are contained in a report from the first workshop, which examined the impact of climate change.
The report says: "Evidence of increasing global temperatures is irrefutable. The world is now 0.6C hotter than it was 100 years ago. Warming has proceeded at a rapid rate and nine of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 1980.
"Last year, was the warmest since records began in 1860 and each month so far has re-written the record books.
"Scotland may become warmer and wetter and possibly windier, particularly in the autumn. Spring and summer temperatures could become a little more variable and winter temperatures are likely to be milder. Heavy downpours and severe winter gales are likely to increase."
It says temperatures in Scotland could have risen by as much as 2.6C by 2080, with 17% more rainfall over the same period. By 2050, sea levels around Scotland could have risen by up to 69cm, with the east coast slightly worse off than the west.
Plant and wildlife habitats could shift northwards by up to 50 miles a decade, threatening rare alpine species, but perhaps encouraging the spread of the midge and other creatures.
There are also fears that the North Atlantic Drift, which is often wrongly referred to as the Gulf Stream, could shift and cause big temperature drops in Scotland, although that is currently not thought likely.
The report highlights the dangers to the Scottish economy, warning of reduction of salmon stocks because of warmer waters and a decline in the winter sports industry due to a lack of snow.
Tourism and agriculture could also be hit, it says.
The cost of flood damage could increase six-fold to #60m over the next 50 years and insurance premiums may rise, the report warns.
Failure to tackle greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, will also contribute to global warming, it adds, although so-called carbon sinks in Scotland, such as forests and peat bogs, help to soak up such emissions.
At the workshop, which involved a range of organisations, Scottish Environment Minister Lord Sewel asked if there was a gap in the UK approach to climate change which could be filled by a distinctly Scottish group.
The report says: "Whilst there is considerable expertise already existing in Scotland, there is a need for leadership and policy support and motivation.
"Many organisations would be reluctant to participate in a concerted approach unless encouraged to do so by Government policy at a high level. It would be important to foster collaborative and integrated research.
"There was agreement that a new forum should advise the Ministers and the Scottish Parliament on climate change."
The paper says the forum could: report every five years; review research and produce an integrated assessment of impacts on Scotland; and make recommendations about policy.

Global heat mounts for US to cut pollution Former environment secretary JOHN GUMMER at the Buenos Aires world climate conference says it is vital for the United States to curb emissions before they cause floods here: [A Edition]

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/global-heat-mounts-us-cut-pollution-former/docview/329291059/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: It's not just the worldwide increase in storms and hurricanes nor even the rising sea levels which are menacing Britain's East coast from Yorkshire to Essex. Scientists are increasingly united in the belief that it is our industrial and traffic pollution which is changing the world's climate. What is at stake in Buenos Aires is the world's climate. We can't reverse the damage we've already done. The earth's temperature will rise by about two degrees centigrade whatever we do, because of the greenhouse gases already up in the atmosphere. What we can do is to stop it getting worse. Fear of those overwhelming effects starting within our children's lifetimes has brought ministers from almost every country in the world to Buenos Aires to try to make last year's agreement, hammered out in Kyoto, actually work. The Honduran floods ought to be concentrating the minds of delegates on the dangers of failure. Sadly, the situation is constantly distorted by intense lobbying by the worst of American big business.

Full text:   YOU can't ignore global warming any more.
It's not just the worldwide increase in storms and hurricanes nor even the rising sea levels which are menacing Britain's East coast from Yorkshire to Essex. Scientists are increasingly united in the belief that it is our industrial and traffic pollution which is changing the world's climate.
Even if you don't rate the scientists, listen to the insurance industry, where the hardheaded money men, from the Guardian Royal to the Munich Re, are busy taking global warming for granted in calculating our premiums.
What is at stake in Buenos Aires is the world's climate. We can't reverse the damage we've already done. The earth's temperature will rise by about two degrees centigrade whatever we do, because of the greenhouse gases already up in the atmosphere. What we can do is to stop it getting worse.
We can just about cope with the present degree of change but we can't manage catastrophic changes which will interrupt the monsoons, turn the whole of Spain and southern France into desert, and may even mean that Britain ceases to benefit from the Gulf Stream.
Fear of those overwhelming effects starting within our children's lifetimes has brought ministers from almost every country in the world to Buenos Aires to try to make last year's agreement, hammered out in Kyoto, actually work. The Honduran floods ought to be concentrating the minds of delegates on the dangers of failure. Sadly, the situation is constantly distorted by intense lobbying by the worst of American big business. A photograph in the Conference Bulletin sums it up. The lugubrious Don Pearlman, longtime paid advocate for the United States' coal and oil industry, was seen on camera passing information to the Saudi Arabian delegate.
Throughout these negotiations, ministers from Britain and the rest of Europe are battling, not just against the entrenched and opposing positions of the United States and China, but against hundreds of well-financed American lobbyists moving freely among Third World delegations, stiffening their resistance to any agreement.
Britain has been at the centre of all this ever since Margaret Thatcher became convinced of the scientists' warnings of impending disaster. Britain's Hadley research centre has done much of the key research.
Tony Blair's Government has taken on John Major's consistently tough line and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott is playing a central part in forging the deal.
He has spelled it out in words of one syllable. Either we act now or it will be too late and our children will never forgive us. "We've got to start taking action at home in all our countries and we've got to convince people that change is possible," he said.
The trouble remains centred in the American fossil fuel industry. They are, in a real sense, dinosaurs. They cannot see that modern industry throughout the world is accepting the facts of climate change and turning them to commercial and technological advantage. The US will be left behind while British companies have set the pace. When BP left the industry lobbying group, the Global Climate Coalition, it made a crucial change. Shell followed, and Amoco will go before the end of the year. An increasingly important group of companies has come out of the closet to fight climate change. Monsanto, Toyota, Allied Signal, United Technologies - even General Motors has taken the first tentative steps.
Yet the battle is not over.
There are still some huge interests fighting to stop any agreement.
Reactionary companies such as Exxon (Esso in the UK) used all their strength to stop the US even signing up to an agreement which they had already made in Kyoto. Now that those tactics have failed, they are trying to make the signature inoperative. One of their friendly senators, Chuck Hagel, claimed yesterday, immediately after the US had announced it would sign, that the protocol is already dead. His industry backers will certainly spend vast sums to make that statement come true.
On the other side, American environmentalists have been putting pressure on the Clinton administration. A huge hot-air balloon floated over the conference yesterday morning, emblazoned with the words "more hot air from the US". The National Environmental Trust has sponsored huge advertisements contrasting Vice-President Al Gore's fine words on the environment with his lack of any effective action. The White House is so annoyed that it has telephoned those who fund this respected green pressure group, threatening them unless they withdraw their money.
SO BUENOS Aires is a frenzy of activity, of charge and countercharge. Some time early tomorrow morning I believe they will reach some sort of agreement.
It will not be enough but it will begin the process of turning Kyoto into a reality. The real problem will continue to be the US and its fear of industry lobbyists. The trouble is that, with 25 per cent of the world's emissions, the US is single-handedly affecting everyone's climate. So it is Britain's climate they are changing. This is therefore not just a matter for the US Senate alone.
Somehow we need to bring home to our American allies that glob- alisation demands global responsibility. If they want the global trading advantages, they will need to take tough measures to protect that globe from disaster.
Buenos Aires is a start but there's a very long way still to go.

Abstract: The Buenos Aires follow-up to the Kyoto protocol on climate change ground to a blessedly inconclusive halt this week, leaving inhabitants of the U.N. wonkasphere to plan further exotically- located conflabs. Global warming hysteria has cooled since Kyoto, despite allegations that the hand of man is behind every extreme weather phenomenon, including the tragic devastation wrought by Hurricane Mitch. Nevertheless, one unlikely place in which the issue seems to have established a firmer foothold is the corporate boardroom. Journalists whose research goes no further than the clippings files maintain that only "loonies" could fail to acknowledge that global warming is a reality. But if that is the case, then Imperial Oil -- Canada's largest and most respected oil company -- is in need of a strait jacket. In a new study, "The High Costs of Kyoto," Imperial not only points out the uncomfortable fact that the science of global warming remains unproven, it clearly lays out the enormous costs of meeting last December's commitments, which for Canada means reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2008-2012 to a target level of 6% below the level of 1990. To criticize those who -- unlike Imperial -- do not take a firm public stand on global warming is not to suggest that they should refuse to take part in the debate. The problem is that some observers appear to believe that the level of corporate interest in the goings on at Buenos Aires gives credence to the science of global warming. It rather reflects a growing realization of the potential costs of unwise policies.

Full text: The Buenos Aires follow-up to the Kyoto protocol on climate change ground to a blessedly inconclusive halt this week, leaving inhabitants of the U.N. wonkasphere to plan further exotically- located conflabs. Global warming hysteria has cooled since Kyoto, despite allegations that the hand of man is behind every extreme weather phenomenon, including the tragic devastation wrought by Hurricane Mitch. Nevertheless, one unlikely place in which the issue seems to have established a firmer foothold is the corporate boardroom.
The vast majority of corporations in developed countries are already acutely sensitive to green issues. Many have made environmental responsibility an integral part of their corporate culture. Managements realize that an environmentally responsible stance is valued both by their employees and their customers, and thus has an impact on the bottom line. But this is not the same as claiming -- on the basis that "the customer is always right" -- that they should cater to every public misconception.
Many corporations -- including some of the world's biggest oil companies -- apparently regard it as a mark of public relations sophistication to adopt an almost Neville Chamberlain approach to global warming. Some now emphasize the "business opportunities" presented by the drastically lower energy consumption that slashing carbon dioxide emissions implies. Some have enthusiastically signed onto "solutions," such as emissions trading, noting not merely that these methods would be "least cost," but also that the U.S. favours them (which means of course that most of the rest of the world doesn't, as became very clear at Buenos Aires).
The media largely acquiesces in this apparent sell-out.
Journalists whose research goes no further than the clippings files maintain that only "loonies" could fail to acknowledge that global warming is a reality. But if that is the case, then Imperial Oil -- Canada's largest and most respected oil company -- is in need of a strait jacket. In a new study, "The High Costs of Kyoto," Imperial not only points out the uncomfortable fact that the science of global warming remains unproven, it clearly lays out the enormous costs of meeting last December's commitments, which for Canada means reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2008-2012 to a target level of 6% below the level of 1990.
"In our view," says the report, "the issue of climate change and what to do about it, if anything, is the most important economic policy issue facing Canada today."
Imperial points out that the cumulative cost to the Canadian economy of meeting Kyoto commitments could, by 2010, amount to half the total public and private education budget, with a cumulative cost by that date as high as $140 billion. Energy prices could double, large numbers of jobs would be lost, family incomes would be significantly reduced. It explodes a number of the spurious rationales concocted by the act-first-think-later environmental school. Perhaps the most prominent is that draconian action now represents a worthwhile "insurance policy." But, as Imperial points out, taking out an insurance policy is a rational decision. Nobody in her right mind would take out a cripplingly expensive insurance policy with unspecified benefits against a risk that may not even exist.
Part of the problem is that the public has not absorbed the enormous costs of meeting emissions targets. In the proper sense of the term, the customer is only right when the customer is actually buying something, and that doesn't include environmental hysteria.
Direct consumer judgment will only come when Canadians discover they are paying -- among many other higher charges -- up to 25 cents a liter extra for gasoline, which Imperial notes is a possibility if Kyoto commitments are to be met.
To criticize those who -- unlike Imperial -- do not take a firm public stand on global warming is not to suggest that they should refuse to take part in the debate. The problem is that some observers appear to believe that the level of corporate interest in the goings on at Buenos Aires gives credence to the science of global warming. It rather reflects a growing realization of the potential costs of unwise policies.
No scientist denies the greenhouse phenomenon as a critical factor in the existence of life on earth, nor that global warming as a result of human activity is a possibility. But a possibility is not a probability, and the alleged solutions are more costly and damaging than the original problem, if there is one at all.
Meanwhile "natural" climate change of the sort that created historical phenomena such as the "Little Ice Age" in Medieval times is likely to be much more important than anything humans might precipitate.
Above all, it is critical to remember that the global warming debate is at least as much an ideological issue as a scientific one.
Global warming is embraced and ceaselessly promoted by the undead left, for whom it represents an apocalyptic nightmare, proving -- yet again -- the inherent evils of capitalism, and establishing that what we really need is more central control at a global level.

Full text:   Sniper Witness Spotted
A man sought as a witness in the sniper killing of an abortion provider near Buffalo has been spotted in at least two locations in New Jersey, the FBI said yesterday.
James Charles Kopp looks different now from photographs distributed by authorities, an FBI spokeswoman said.
"He is wearing a bushier beard, and he also has gained approximately 10 to 15 pounds," said the spokeswoman, in Newark. "He may additionally be wearing large, reading-type glasses."
Kopp, 44, has also been spotted in the central part of the state, in the Red Bank area, she said. Kopp is wanted on a federal material witness warrant in the Oct. 23 shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian of Amherst, N.Y.
Additional Gacy Victims? A ground radar survey and a tip from a former detective may lead police to dig behind a house for more victims of John Wayne Gacy, who was executed in 1994 for the killings of 33 boys and young men.
Police in Chicago said yesterday that it was too soon to determine if digging was warranted behind the house on the city's Northwest Side. The radar indicates, but does not prove, the presence of as many as four bodies buried almost 3 1/2 feet deep, the Chicago Tribune reported, citing unnamed sources.
Holocaust Fund Set Up Six European insurance firms agreed yesterday to set up a $90 million humanitarian fund to aid Holocaust victims and to conduct an audit of their books to identify unpaid Holocaust-era claims.
The agreement followed a meeting of an international commission set up with the insurance companies, the U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the World Jewish Congress.
The WJC has estimated that pre-war life insurance policies held by European Jews were valued at $2.5 billion at today's prices. The commission will now investigate the archives of the insurance companies and establish a mechanism for repaying claims.
Argentina to Curb Gases Argentina will become the first developing country to announce targets to curb its emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases to help fight global warming, President Carlos Menem told a UN climate change conference yesterday.
Argentina's announcement was hailed by its close ally, the United States, which is refusing to ratify the Kyoto climate treaty and cut its own emissions without "meaningful participation" from key developing countries.
But it could enrage China and India, which argued that they are too poor to limit their burning of fossil fuels which emit gases like carbon dioxide and that rich nations which contribute most to global warming should pay to clean up.
The fight over developing-world participation has threatened to stop all progress at the Buenos Aires conference, which ends tomorrow. It was meant to find ways of implementing the promise by rich countries in Kyoto, Japan, last December, to cut their emissions by 5.2 percent from 1990 levels by 2008 through 2012.
Pinochet `Immunity' Cited
Britain's highest court is expected to finish hearing testimony today on whether former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is immune from trial.
Yesterday, as Britain received Spain's formal request for Pinochet's extradition, lawyers for Pinochet told the five judges from the House of Lords that as a former head of state he had "absolute immunity" from prosecution.
The Law Lords are considering an appeal by the Crown Prosecution Service, on behalf of Madrid, against a lower court ruling that the ex-dictator was unlawfully arrested on Oct. 16 because he has sovereign immunity.

Full text: Chancellor's
statement n
Mr Gordon Brown told the Commons:
"In this year's Pre-Budget Report we seek to steer a course of stability amid a world economic downturn. We set in place measures to increase productivity and provide support for enterprise. We introduce new measures to make work pay for all our peoplea nd we show how we will invest in health, education and our infrastructure, to provide the modern services on which people rely, in each case long term decisions that will equip our country for the future.
The background to this report is the global downturn, which started in Asia and which has reverberated throughout every continent. It has not only shifted the balance of risks in the world economy from fears about inflation to fears about growth, buthas forced every country, every continent, every international financial institution to cut their estimates for growth.
World trade growth is set to fall by two thirds.
Forecasts for world growth as a whole have now been virtually halved.
One quarter of the world is in recession.
And my objective, the objective for Britain, is that in this uncertain world, Britain not only steers a stable course but that, by building up our long term strength, is more than equal to any and every challenge the global economy presents.
Because in the last 18 months British inflation has been brought down to its target of 2.5 per cent, and because Britain has set in place a new long term monetary framework, with the independence of the Bank of England, Britain is better placed thanin the past to face these global difficulties.
And because, too, Britain has tackled its structural deficit in the public finances we are more able to steer that stable course.
But as all forecasts round the world have made clear there is acute uncertainty about the eventual outcome of the global financial instability.
So we are conscious of the balance of risks - the risk on the one hand of a sharper slowdown in the world economy as a result of instability and its effect on confidence, the risk on the other that inflationary pressures might persist.
The Pre-Budget Report is set with this firmly in mind, no denial of short term difficulties, no diversion from policies for long term strength.
And our challenge in the year ahead is to strengthen the three essential foundations for that long term strength and success.
"First, Britain now has, for the first time, a consistent long term framework for both monetary and fiscal policy - one that has an inbuilt capacity to respond credibly to short term pressures and one from which we will not be deflected.
Second, with business, we are putting in place a strategy to tackle a fundamental long term economic weakness, the 40 per cent productivity gap with our most successful competitors - and these measures include investment in education and innovation,andnew encouragement for enterprise and competition.
And third, with our Welfare to Work programme and by ensuring that work pays, we are extending opportunity to all, creating a Britain where no one is excluded, and everyone has a contribution to make, a Britain that is both enterprising and fair.
Stability n
First, the foundation of long term economic stability.
Official figures now show that by spring, 1997, with consumer spending growing at an unsustainable pace, inflation was heading way above the country's 2.5 per cent target, to twice that of our competitors, four per cent and above, and that Britain wasse t to repeat the boom-bust cycle that had led to 15 per cent interest rates for a whole year in 1990.
Because immediate action was taken - making the Bank of England independent, and tackling the inflationary pressures - inflation is today at our target of 2.5 per cent. And I can announce that for future years our forecast is that it will stay ontarget.
As a result, Britain's long term interest rates have come down from over seven per cent to five per cent; the differential between Britain and Germany has narrowed by nearly one per cent; long term interest rates are now the lowest for 35 years, thelowest since Britain's boom-bust cycle became entrenched.
And because Britain has brought inflation under control it has been possible, as the world has turned downwards, for interest rates to be able to respond more quickly and in a more forward-looking way than in past British economic cycles.
In the previous economic cycle, interest rates remained in double figures for over four years. In contrast, the Bank of England has already been able to reduce interest rates to respond to a changed international environment.
Long term monetary stability is a pre-condition of economic success and I reaffirm my support for the Bank of England's independence - its remit and membership - and I do not believe that any political party - putting the long term interests of Britainf irst, will, on reflection, bring party politics and short-termism back into interest rate decisions.
It is also because Britain now has a new long term fiscal framework - with clear disciplines set out in the Code for Fiscal Stability that we are laying before Parliament today - that, as world growth slows, fiscal policy is able to make itscontribution to stability and future growth in Britain.
"The official figures published today confirm that in our first year we cut the budget deficit from pounds 28 billion to pounds 8 billion pounds.
This tightening has continued throughout our second year, a total fiscal tightening in two years of 3.75 per cent of national income. So fiscal policy has played its part with interest rate policy in tackling inflationary pressures.
I can tell the House that, because we have concentrated on our priorities and cut waste, spending will be a total of pounds 2 billion pounds below the ceilings we inherited.
As a result, our current budget this year is expected to be pounds 5.5 billion pounds in surplus, and what was prudently projected to be net borrowing of pounds 1 billion pounds is now expected to be a debt repayment of pounds 1.5 billion pounds.
The golden rule is that over the cycle, we balance the current budget, in other words on current spending that we eliminate the structural deficit. I can report to the House that because of the tough action we have taken since we came to Government thisis exactly what we are now achieving.
Having broken with short termism and created, for the long term, a stable monetary and fiscal framework, with an inbuilt capacity to be more responsive to the economic cycle, fiscal and monetary policy can both together contribute to stability andgrowth in the coming years.
My forecast for 1999 - of one to 1.5 per cent growth - will see Britain steering a stable course even when one quarter of the world is in recession.
And as the economy returns to its sustainable growth path, we expect growth in 2000 to be between 2.25 and 2.75 per cent. And in 2001 between 2.75 and 3.25 per cent.
It is because we are cautious about the balance of risks in the economy that we have based public finance forecasts on deliberately more prudent assumptions than before.
First, our public finances are planned on an estimate of 2.25 per cent trend rate of growth, 0.25 per cent lower than the assumption that we inherited.
Second, our forecasts have revised downwards the ratio of VAT receipts to projected consumer spending, reducing estimated revenues by nearly pounds 4 billion over the next five years.
Third, revenues from tackling fraud have been set at a more cautious level than in the last Parliament.
Fourth, we have discontinued the imprudent practice of assuming revenues from privatisations that have not even been agreed.
In each case our assumptions have been independently audited by the National Audit Office.
And, because of the experience of the early 1990s, we have adopted a more prudent approach to forecasting income tax and corporation tax revenues, including a cautious estimate of revenue from self assessment.
So, even after making most prudent assumptions and then taking into account the world downturn, we meet our first rule - to balance our current budget over the cycle.
We expect the current surplus to be pounds 1 billion pounds next year, pounds 3 billion pounds in 2000-2001, pounds 8 billion pounds the year after that, pounds 10 billion pounds and pounds 11 billion pounds in the two years to follow. For the sameyears , net borrowing is expected to be pounds 4 billion pounds and successively pounds 5 billion, pounds 2 billion, pounds 2 billion and pounds 1 billion. Figures better in every year of this Parliament than in any year of the last Parliament.
An estimated current surplus for the coming five years of pounds 33 billion pounds, a margin that shows that we are equipped to cope with further uncertainties.
This pounds 33 billion pounds contrasts with, under the last Government, a deficit of pounds 149 billion pounds over the economic cycle, as national debt doubled.
Our second rule, the sustainable investment rule, requires that, as we borrow for investment, debt is set at a prudent and stable level.
In the last year of the last Government, that debt ratio was 45 per cent. In the next three years, to meet the needs of a modern infrastructure, public investment will double.
As a result of our overall prudence, debt as a proportion of GDP is set to fall below 40 per cent to 39 per cent next year, to 38 and then to 36.5 per cent.
And members who take a special interest in the Maastricht criteria will want to know that in each year of the next five years Britain is comfortably within the Maastricht guidelines.
Productivity n
Long-term economic stability, from which we will not be diverted, is the foundation for future success.
But we will only achieve our long term goals for growth and employment through an even more radical modernisation of our economic policy in favour of opportunity, enterprise and work.
We need to push ahead with modernisation in every area - improving productivity, expanding opportunity and investing in our future. And in every one of these areas our economic policy is based on getting the best out of all our people and all theirpoten tial - in other words, on maximising economic opportunity for all. What makes for a good economy also makes for a good society - one that is fair and cohesive.
So I now turn to the first conclusions from the review we have conducted with British business into removing the barriers to productivity.
As our seminars with business have revealed, the only way for Britain to be at the forefront of the new knowledge-based economies of the future is by modern policies for education, employee participation, small business development and science andinnova tion.
Our first recommendations concern the quality of education. With our pounds 19 billion pound investment in educational reform, we have set out demanding targets for literacy, numeracy, teaching standards and qualifications. And with my Rt Hon friendtheSecretary of State for Education and Employment's announcement today of a pounds 250 million pound investment in a new traineeship programme for teenagers, we have now made it possible for every young person after 16 to stay on in part-time or fulimeedu cation, to get qualifications and to have the opportunity of a job.
But to meet the productivity challenge we must do far more to encourage the ambitions of all our children, not least by bringing the world of education and the world of work into closer contact.
Over the next year we plan to enlist business leaders to take the world of work and business into our classrooms.
And to encourage businesses to offer expertise and management help to our schools and colleges, I can announce that the Budget will allow businesses to claim tax relief when they second staff to schools and colleges.
But as our productivity discussions with business have also revealed, Britain can do more to remove the barriers to opportunity and to ambition.
The opportunity not just to acquire the best skills but the ambition to work your way up and use your creative talents, the ambition to start and build a successful business, the ambition to see the firm in which you work succeed and you succeed withit.
Today, only a fraction of British employees and an even smaller minority of those outside senior management own shares in the companies that they work in and yet the evidence is that employee commitment is a vital strength for companies competing andsuc ceeding in the global economy. And I want, through targeted tax reform, to reward long term commitment by employees and I want to remove, once and for all, the old "them and us" culture in British industry. I want to encourage the new enterpriseculture of team work in which everyone contributes and everyone benefits from success. So, in the Budget we will make it easier for all employees - and not just a few - to become stakeholders in their company.
I want to double the number of firms in which all employees have the opportunity to own shares.
Many employees already hold shares through their pension funds. So I will propose to pensions funds and other institutions that they should provide better and more direct public information to their members and investors.
In future, more of our wealth and jobs will come from small and growing businesses.
In just 18 months we have announced cuts in the rate of corporation tax on large companies twice to 30 pence, and for small companies twice to 20 pence - its lowest level ever.
In the Budget we will consider a further tax reduction for small businesses. In particular we will consider converting the temporary investment allowance we introduced last year into a permanent tax cut.
But I have in mind a bigger reform to cut the burden of tax and red tape. Small businesses getting started and growing, lack not only the resources to pay tax but the back up to administer national insurance, income tax, their VAT payments and theirpayroll systems.
From April, 1999, the Inland Revenue and the Contributions Agency will be merged. And we propose to roll out, on a nationwide basis, a new comprehensive service for new businesses, helping replace time- consuming book-keeping by offering a one stopadvice service administered by a national helpline, backed up by local offices.
So from now on every department of government will have an obligation to encourage enterprise and entrepreneurs.
And I can confirm to businesses also that we will re-examine planning regulations and building control to identify barriers to productivity and job creation and how the planning system can be speeded up in Britain to help us emulate the success ofhi-tec h clusters and corridors like America's Silicon Valley.
Access to bank finance is critical to the success of every single small business. I have therefore asked the banks to work with Mr Don Cruickshank to assess what steps can be taken to more effectively serve the needs of businesses in the economy.
And to open up and enhance competition we will ensure, with a 20 per cent increase in new funding, that the Office of Fair Trading has the necessary resources to break down barriers which prevent new firms entering markets and keep prices high forconsum ers. Further announcements on how the new arrangements will proceed will come from my Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he publishes his Competitiveness White Paper.
Our policy is pro-small business, pro-share ownership, pro-tax simplification and pro-competition.
Our policy is also pro-skills and pro-science.
To turn scientific inventions in Britain into jobs for Britain we need to do more to honour the spirit of invention, facilitate the exploitation of invention and encourage the commercialisation of invention.
More than ever innovation is the key to higher productivity. So w must see that inventions which are created in Britain are developed and manufactured in Britain.
The first step is a higher quality and quantity of research and development. So the Government will consult small business on supplementing the current tax relief for R&D with a more effective tax credit for small business based on the volume of R&Dinvestment.
Three months ago we announced a partnership with the Wellcome Trust to invest over one billion pound to re-equip university science in Britain, the largest ever investment in Britain's science base.
Having received an overwhelming response from universities to our new University Challenge Fund - the private public partnership for commercialising scientific inventions - we are now inviting further private sector involvement.
I now want to complete the path that takes inventions from the science lab through to high tech venture capital and then to the national and global marketplace.
So I am announcing today that to develop business expertise in science and to transfer technology from the science lab to the marketplace, we will endow up to eight new Institutes of Enterprise in British universities. A further signal of ourdeterminati on that the genius of British invention will once again become an engine for British growth and jobs.
A strong venture capital industry supporting high tech, high risk investments is critical to the future of Britain.
Today we have only six per cent of the early stage high tech venture capital of the United States. So we will consult on and consider new incentives, including how to encourage our most successful companies to invest in start-ups, and how we can providenew sources of venture capital and management expertise for entrepreneurs.
The productivity challenge is one that must be met by the public sector and not just the private sector.
Next month, for the first time, the Government will publish Public Service Agreements which set, for all departments, clear targets for improved performance. And to help them meet these targets and to monitor performance we are establishing an advisoryp anel from business and management.
Absenteeism costs the public sector up to pounds 6 billion pounds a year. Specific targets are being set for each department to reduce absence rates by 20 per cent by 2001 and 30 per cent by 2003.
We are working with business, not just to promote higher productivity, but to secure policies for a sustainable environment.
I am publishing today the Report of Lord Marshall, formerly president of the CBI, into the role of economic instruments and the business use of energy. I thank him for his work, which substantially moves forward the debate, and the Government will givef ull consideration to his recommendations as part of its wider strategy on climate change.
Today I am also publishing a consultation document, containing proposals for a pounds 50 pound reduction in Vehicle Excise Duty for the smallest and most environmentally efficient cars.
Welfare to Work n
Just as the Government is modernising our industrial economy so, too, we are modernising employment policy.
The House will be pleased to know that by next April 300,000 people will have benefited from the New Deal. That is now giving men and women previously left out and excluded a new sense of hope.
Already, 29,000 companies have signed up to the New Deal and 30,000 have found jobs with employers, jobs they would not have had without the New Deal.
We are now ready to extend the New Deal. From November 30, 60,000 opportunities will be created for the long term unemployed in 28 areas of the country.
In Northern Ireland, in support of the peace process, we will now guarantee new opportunities to all those men and women who have been unemployed for more than 18 months.
We will also extend nationwide the New Deal skills shortage programme, and offer up-front support for training to help fill the vacancies that come on-stream every month.
And by March next year I can confirm that to tackle skill shortages there will be 120 centres for IT and high tech training in every part of the country.
Side-by-side with the New Deal there will be new guarantees that work will pay more than benefits.
From April, as a result of abolishing the entry fee to national insurance, all employees will receive a tax cut of pounds 66.
And business will be pleased that I can announce that from April, employers will not pay national insurance on earnings below pounds 83 pounds a week, the 1999 level for the personal tax allowance.
When it is economically right to do so - and so that work pays more - we will introduce the ten pence starting rate of income tax.
From April 1, 1.9 million employees, including 1.3 million women, will benefit from the minimum wage.
And I can also confirm that the minimum income guarantee for a low paid family, which as a result of the working families tax credit was announced at pounds 180 pounds will, as a result of the minimum wage and tax and benefit changes we are making, bera ised to pounds 190 pounds a week from October next year.
So that work pays - a guaranteed minimum of pounds 190 pounds - with no income tax to pay on incomes below pounds 220 pounds a week.
This will guarantee a minimum income for a lone parent with one child of at least pounds 5.50 pounds an hour, and for an adult with two children pounds 6.37 pounds an hour.
To enable parents and carers to balance work and family responsibilities, I want to provide extra help for child care. We have provided resources for up to one million new child care places over the next four years.
And today, consistent with our national child care strategy we will extend our new childcare tax credit to cover all children up to age 14. And in the case of children who are disabled, and who have greater needs, until the school leaving age of 16.
We will also match the working families tax credit with a new disabled person's tax credit that will ensure that work pays for a disabled man or woman who takes a job.
A disabled person, with one child, moving from benefit to full time employment, will be guaranteed a minimum income of pounds 220 pounds a week, with no income tax payable on income below pounds 274 pounds a week.
Disabled men and women taking up work will be as much as pounds 78 pounds a week better off.
So under this Government, disabled people, who want to work, will now be guaranteed fair treatment at work and work will pay.
And matching the minimum income guarantee for disabled persons in work there will be a new disability income guarantee of pounds 128 a week for the severely disabled out of work.
And at the same time, we are guaranteeing pensioner couples a new minimum income of pounds 117 a week. And this will be followed in the Budget with a guarantee that pensioners will have no income tax to pay unless their income rises above a newspecified level.
And as a result of the measures we have taken - by following up our cut in VAT on fuel with tougher regulation and our new winter fuel payments - I can say that pensioners are saving pounds 108 pounds on their fuel bills and the poorest pensioners aresa ving pounds 140 pounds.
So our task as a country for the coming year, steering a course of stability, is to meet the productivity challenge, to extend fairness and welfare to work, and to make the modern investment we need in our future.
Investing in our future n
And I am pleased to announce that following the modernisation of the private finance initiative there will be new investment in our infrastructure - in over 1,000 schools, in over 25 hospitals and in dozens of public transport projects - over the comingthree years an additional pounds 11 billion pounds.
And I can also confirm that over the three years from next April, public investment itself will double and do so at the right time - the right decision, the right course of action for our country.
I have one further announcement:
Because of our prudence in the management of public finances, Government spending is well within the limits we set.
Our prudence is for a purpose.
Therefore, to ensure in every part of the United Kingdom the health care that people - and especially elderly people - need this winter, I am today making an additional and immediate winter cash allocation, to be spent in the next five months, of pounds250 million pounds more for our National Health Service.
And I can confirm that because this Government believes in the best health and the best education, not just for a few but for all our people, we will invest an additional pounds 40 billion pounds in the modernisation of education and our health serviceo ver the next three years.
Public services that in the months and the years ahead are safe in this Government's hands.
A Government that is steering a stable course, prudently investing in our future, proudly building strong public services and consistently keeping its promises to the British people.
And I commend this statement to the House.

'Seeking to steer a course of stability amid world downturn' CHANCELLOR'S SPEECH: [London edition]

Abstract: Because in the last 18 months British inflation has been brought down to its target of 2.5 per cent, and because Britain has set in place a new long-term monetary framework, with the independence of the Bank of England, Britain is better placed than in the past to face these global difficulties. Official figures now show that by spring 1997, with consumer spending growing at an unsustainable pace, inflation was heading way above the country's 2.5 per cent target, to twice that of our competitors, 4 per cent and above, and that Britain was set to repeat the boom-bust cycle that had led to 15 per cent interest rates for a whole year in 1990. Because immediate action was taken - making the Bank of England independent, and tackling the inflationary pressures - inflation is today at our target of 2.5 per cent. And I can announce that for future years our forecast is that it will stay on target. As a result, Britain's long-term interest rates have come down from over 7 per cent to 5 per cent; the differential between Britain and Germany has narrowed by nearly 1 per cent; long-term interest rates are now the lowest for 35 years, the lowest since Britain's boom-bust cycle became entrenched.

Full text: In this year's pre-Budget report we seek to steer a course of stability amid a world economic downturn. We set in place measures to increase productivity and provide support for enterprise. We introduce new measures to make work pay for all our people and we show how we will invest in health, education and our infrastructure, to provide the modern services on which people rely, in each case long-term decisions that will equip our country for the future.
The background to this report is the global downturn, which started in Asia and which has reverberated throughout every continent. It has not only shifted the balance of risks in the world economy from fears about inflation to fears about growth, but has forced every country, every continent, every international financial institution to cut their estimates for growth.
World trade growth is set to fall by two thirds. Forecasts for world growth as a whole have now been virtually halved. One quarter of the world is in recession.
And my objective, the objective for Britain, is that in this uncertain world, Britain not only steers a stable course but that, by building up our long-term strength, is more than equal to any and every challenge the global economy presents.
Because in the last 18 months British inflation has been brought down to its target of 2.5 per cent, and because Britain has set in place a new long-term monetary framework, with the independence of the Bank of England, Britain is better placed than in the past to face these global difficulties.
And because too, Britain has tackled its structural deficit in the public finances we are more able to steer that stable course.
But as all forecasts round the world have made clear there is acute uncertainty about the eventual outcome of the global financial instability.
So we are conscious of the balance of risks - the risk on the one hand of a sharper slowdown in the world economy as a result of instability and its effect on confidence, the risk on the other that inflationary pressures might persist.
The pre-Budget report is set with this firmly in mind, no denial of short-term difficulties, no diversion from policies for long-term strength.
And our challenge in the year ahead is to strengthen the three essential foundations for that long-term strength and success.
First, Britain now has, for the first time, a consistent long-term framework for both monetary and fiscal policy - one that has an inbuilt capacity to respond credibly to short-term pressures and one from which we will not be deflected.
Second, with business, we are putting in place a strategy to tackle a fundamental long-term economic weakness, the 40 per cent productivity gap with our most successful competitors - and these measures include investment in education and innovation, and new encouragement for enterprise and competition.
And third, with our Welfare-to-Work programme and by ensuring that work pays, we are extending opportunity to all, creating a Britain where no one is excluded, and everyone has a contribution to make, a Britain that is both enterprising and fair. Stability
First, the foundation of long-term economic stability.
Official figures now show that by spring 1997, with consumer spending growing at an unsustainable pace, inflation was heading way above the country's 2.5 per cent target, to twice that of our competitors, 4 per cent and above, and that Britain was set to repeat the boom-bust cycle that had led to 15 per cent interest rates for a whole year in 1990.
Because immediate action was taken - making the Bank of England independent, and tackling the inflationary pressures - inflation is today at our target of 2.5 per cent. And I can announce that for future years our forecast is that it will stay on target. As a result, Britain's long-term interest rates have come down from over 7 per cent to 5 per cent; the differential between Britain and Germany has narrowed by nearly 1 per cent; long-term interest rates are now the lowest for 35 years, the lowest since Britain's boom-bust cycle became entrenched.
And because Britain has brought inflation under control it has been possible, as the world has turned downwards, for interest rates to be able to respond more quickly and in a more forward-looking way than in past British economic cycles.
In the previous economic cycle, interest rates remained in double figures for over four years. In contrast, the Bank of England has already been able to reduce interest rates to respond to a changed international environment.
Long-term monetary stability is a pre-condition of economic success and I reaffirm my support for the Bank of England's independence - its remit and membership - and I do not believe that any political party - putting the long-term interests of Britain first, will, on reflection, bring party politics and short-termism back into interest rate decisions.
It is also because Britain now has a new long-term fiscal framework - with clear disciplines set out in the Code for Fiscal Stability that we are laying before parliament today - that, as world growth slows, fiscal policy is able to make its contribution to stability and future growth in Britain.
The official figures published today confirm that in our first year we cut the budget deficit from £28bn to £8bn.
This tightening has continued throughout our second year, a total fiscal tightening in two years of 3{3/4} per cent of national income. So fiscal policy has played its part with interest rate policy in tackling inflationary pressures.
I can tell the House that, because we have concentrated on our priorities and cut waste, spending will be a total of £2bn below the ceilings we inherited.
As a result, our current budget this year is expected to be £5{1/2}bn in surplus, and what was prudently projected to be net borrowing of £1bn is now expected to be a debt repayment of £1{1/2}bn.
The golden rule is that over the cycle, we balance the current budget, in other words on current spending that we eliminate the structural deficit. I can report to the House that because of the tough action we have taken since we came to government this is exactly what we are now achieving.
Having broken with short termism and created, for the long term, a stable monetary and fiscal framework, with an inbuilt capacity to be more responsive to the economic cycle, fiscal and monetary policy can both together contribute to stability and growth in the coming years.
My forecast for 1999 - of 1 to
1{1/2} per cent growth for 1999 - will see Britain steering a stable course even when one-quarter of the world is in recession.
And as the economy returns to its sustainable growth path, we expect growth in 2000 to be between 2{1/4} per cent and 2{3/4} per cent. And in 2001 between 2{3/4} and 3{1/4} per cent.
It is because we are cautious about the balance of risks in the economy that we have based public finance forecasts on deliberately more prudent assumptions than before.
First, our public finances are planned on an estimate of 2{1/4} per cent trend rate of growth, {1/4} per cent lower than the assumption that we inherited.
Second, our forecasts have revised downwards the ratio of VAT receipts to projected consumer spending, reducing estimated revenues by nearly £4bn over the next five years.
Third, revenues from tackling fraud have been set at a more cautious level than in the last parliament.
Fourth, we have discontinued the imprudent practice of assuming revenues from privatisations that have not even been agreed.
In each case our assumptions have been independently audited by the National Audit Office.
And, because of the experience of the early 1990s, we have adopted a more prudent approach to forecasting income tax and corporation tax revenues, including a cautious estimate of revenue from self-assessment.
So, even after making most prudent assumptions and then taking into account the world downturn, we meet our first rule - to balance our current budget over the cycle.
We expect the current surplus to be £1bn next year, £3bn in 2000-2001, £8bn the year after that, £10bn and £11bn in the two years to follow. For the same years, net borrowing is expected to be £4bn and successively 5, 2, 2 and 1. Figures better in every year of this parliament than in any year of the last parliament.
An estimated current surplus for the coming 5 years of £33bn, a margin that shows that we are equipped to cope with further uncertainties.
This £33bn contrasts with, under the last government, a deficit of £149bn over the economic cycle, as national debt doubled.
Our second rule, the sustainable investment rule, requires that, as we borrow for investment, debt is set at a prudent and stable level.
In the last year of the last government, that debt ratio was 45 per cent. In the next three years, to meet the needs of a modern infrastructure, public investment will double.
As a result of our overall prudence, debt as a proportion of GDP is set to fall below 40 per cent to 39 per cent next year, to 38 and then to 36{1/2} per cent.
And members who take a special interest in the Maastricht criteria will want to know that in each year of the next five years Britain is comfortably within the Maastricht guidelines. Productivity
Long-term economic stability, from which we will not be diverted, is the foundation for future success.
But we will only achieve our long-term goals for growth and employment through an even more radical modernisation of our economic policy in favour of opportunity, enterprise and work.
We need to push ahead with modernisation in every area - improving productivity, expanding opportunity and investing in our future. And in every one of these areas our economic policy is based on getting the best out of all our people and all their potential - in other words, on maximising economic opportunity for all. What makes for a good economy also makes for a good society - one that is fair and cohesive.
So I now turn to the first conclusions from the review we have conducted with British business into removing the barriers to productivity.
As our seminars with business have revealed, the only way for Britain to be at the forefront of the new knowledge-based economies of the future is by modern policies for education, employee participation, small business development and science and innovation.
Our first recommendations concern the quality of education. With our £19bn investment in educational reform, we have set out demanding targets for literacy, numeracy, teaching standards and qualifications. And with my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment's announcement today of a £250m investment in a new traineeship programme for teenagers, we have now made it possible for every young person after 16 to stay on in part-time or full-time education, to get qualifications and to have the opportunity of a job.
But to meet the productivity challenge we must do far more to encourage the ambitions of all our children, not least by bringing the world of education and the world of work into closer contact.
Over the next year we plan to enlist business leaders to take the world of work and business into our classrooms.
And to encourage businesses to offer expertise and management to help to our schools and colleges, I can announce that the Budget will allow businesses to claim tax relief when they second staff to schools and colleges.
But as our productivity discussions with business have also revealed, Britain can do more to remove the barriers to opportunity and to ambition.
The opportunity not just to acquire the best skills but the ambition to work your way up and use your creative talents, the ambition to start and build a successful business, the ambition to see the firm in which you work succeed and you succeed with it.
Today, only a fraction of British employees and an even smaller minority of those outside senior management own shares in the companies that they work in and yet the evidence is that employee commitment is a vital strength for companies competing and succeeding in the global economy.
And I want, through targeted tax reform, to reward long-term commitment by employees and I want to remove, once and for all, the old 'them and us' culture in British industry. I want to encourage the new enterprise culture of team-work in which everyone contributes and everyone benefits from success. So, in the Budget we will make it easier for all employees - and not just a few - to become stakeholders in their company.
I want to double the number of firms in which all employees have the opportunity to own shares.
Many employees already hold shares through their pension funds. So I will propose to pensions funds and other institutions that they should provide better and more direct public information to their members and investors.
In future, more of our wealth and jobs will come from small and growing businesses.
In just 18 months we have announced cuts in the rate of corporation tax on large companies twice to 30 pence, and for small companies twice to 20 pence - its lowest level ever.
In the Budget we will consider a further tax reduction for small businesses. In particular we will consider converting the temporary investment allowance we introduced last year into a permanent tax cut.
But I have in mind a bigger reform to cut the burden of tax and red tape. Small businesses getting started and growing, lack not only the resources to pay tax but the back up to administer national insurance, income tax, their VAT payments and their payroll systems.
From April 1999, the Inland Revenue and the Contributions Agency will be merged. And we propose to roll out, on a nationwide basis, a new comprehensive service for new businesses, helping replace time consuming bookkeeping by offering a one-stop advice service administered by a national helpline, backed up by local offices.
So from now on every department of government will have an obligation to encourage enterprise and entrepreneurs.
And I can confirm to businesses also that we will re-examine planning regulations and building control to identify barriers to productivity and job creation and how the planning system can be speeded up in Britain to help us emulate the success of high-tech clusters and corridors like America's silicon valley.
Access to bank finance is critical to the success of every single small business. I have therefore asked the banks to work with Mr Don Cruickshank to assess what steps can be taken to more effectively serve the needs of businesses in the economy.
And to open up and enhance competition we will ensure, with a 20 per cent increase in new funding, that the Office of Fair Trading has the necessary resources to break down barriers which prevent new firms entering markets and keep prices high for consumers. Further announcements on how the new arrangements will proceed will come from my Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he publishes his Competitiveness white paper.

Having received an overwhelming response from universities to our new University Challenge Fund - the private-public partnership for commercialising scientific inventions - we are now inviting further private sector involvement.
I now want to complete the path that takes inventions from the science lab through to high-tech venture capital and then to the national and global marketplace.
So I am announcing today that to develop business expertise in science and to transfer technology from the science lab to the marketplace, we will endow up to eight new Institutes of Enterprise in British universities. A further signal of our determination that the genius of British invention will once again become an engine for British growth and jobs.
A strong venture capital industry supporting high-tech, high-risk investments is critical to the future of Britain.
Today we have only 6 per cent of the early stage high-tech venture capital of the US. So we will consult on and consider new incentives, including how to encourage our most successful companies to invest in start-ups, and how we can provide new sources of venture capital and management expertise for entrepreneurs.

Just as the government is modernising our industrial economy, so too we are modernising employment policy.
The House will be pleased to know that by next April 300,000 people will have benefited from the New Deal. That is now giving men and women previously left out and excluded a new sense of hope.
Already, 29,000 companies have signed up to the New Deal and 30,000 have found jobs with employers, jobs they would not have had without the New Deal.
We are now ready to extend the New Deal. From 30 November, 60,000 opportunities will be created for the long-term unemployed in 28 areas of the country.
In Northern Ireland, in support of the peace process, we will now guarantee new opportunities to all those men and women who have been unemployed for more than 18 months.
We will also extend nationwide the New Deal skills shortage programme, and offer up-front support for training to help fill the vacancies that come on-stream every month.
And by March next year I can confirm that to tackle skill shortages there will be 120 centres for IT and high-tech training in every part of the country.
Side-by-side with the New Deal there will be new guarantees that work will pay more than benefits.
From April, as a result of abolishing the entry fee to national insurance, all employees will receive a tax cut of £66 a year.
And business will be pleased that I can announce that from April, employers will not pay national insurance on earnings below £83 a week, the 1999 level for the personal tax allowance.
When it is economically right to do so - and so that work pays more - we will introduce the 10 pence starting rate of income tax.
From April 1, 1.9m employees, including 1.3m women, will benefit from the minimum wage.
And I can also confirm that the minimum income guarantee for a low paid family, which as a result of the working families tax credit was announced at £180 will, as a result of the minimum wage and tax and benefit changes we are making, be raised to £190 a week from October next year.
So that work pays - a guaranteed minimum of £190 - with no income tax to pay on incomes below £220 a week.
This will guarantee a minimum income for a lone parent with one child of at least £5.50 an hour, and for an adult with 2 children £6.37 an hour.
To enable parents and carers to balance work and family responsibilities, I want to provide extra help for childcare. We have provided resources for up to 1m new childcare places over the next four years. And today, consistent with our national childcare strategy we will extend our new childcare tax credit to cover all children up to age 14. And in the case of children who are disabled, and who have greater needs, until the school leaving age of 16.
We will also match the working families tax credit with a new disabled person's tax credit that will ensure that work pays for a disabled man or woman who takes a job.
A disabled person, with one child, moving from benefit to full time employment, will be guaranteed a minimum income of £220 a week, with no income tax payable on income below £274 a week.
Disabled men and women taking up work will be as much as £78 a week better off.
So under this government, disabled people, who want to work, will now be guaranteed fair treatment at work and work will pay.
And matching the minimum income guarantee for disabled persons in work there will be a new disability income guarantee of £128 a week for the severely disabled out of work.
And at the same time, we are guaranteeing pensioner couples a new minimum income of £117 a week. And this will be followed in the Budget with a guarantee that pensioners will have no income tax to pay unless their income rises above a new specified level.
And as a result of the measures we have taken - by following up our cut in VAT on fuel with tougher regulation and our new winter fuel payments - I can say that pensioners are saving £108 on their fuel bills and the poorest pensioners are saving £140.
So our task as a country for the coming year, steering a course of stability, is to meet the productivity challenge, to extend fairness and welfare to work, and to make the modern investment we need in our future. Investing in our Future
And I am pleased to announce that following the modernisation of the private finance initiative there will be new investment in our infrastructure - in over 1,000 schools, in over 25 hospitals and in dozens of public transport projects - over the coming three years an additional £11bn.
And I can also confirm that over the three years from next April, public investment itself will double and do so at the right time - the right decision, the right course of action for our country.
I have one further announcement.
Because of our prudence in the management of public finances, government spending is well within the limits we set.
Our prudence is for a purpose.
Therefore, to ensure in every part of the United Kingdom the healthcare that people - and especially elderly people - need this winter, I am today making an additional and immediate winter cash allocation, to be spent in the next five months, of £250m more for our National Health Service.
And I can confirm that because this government believes in the best health and the best education, not just for a few but for all our people, we will invest an additional £40bn in the modernisation of education and our health service over the next three years.
Public services that in the months and the years ahead are safe in this government's hands.
A government that is steering a stable course, prudently investing in our future, proudly building strong public services and consistently keeping its promises to the British people.
And I commend this Statement to the House. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: IMMIGRATION: The fundamental immigration problem today is with illegal immigrants, not legal immigrants. To address this problem, I have supported efforts to control our borders. In terms of legal immigration, I agree with the current policy, which prioritizes family reunification. In addition, I have supported other forms of legal immigration that serve a specific purpose. I introduced a bill that will provide Florida's farmers with a legal method to meet their seasonal labor requirements if adequate numbers of U.S. workers are not available. I also support legislation that would allow some high- skilled workers to legally work in the United States if there are not U.S. workers available.

Full text:   United States Congress
A United States senator must be at least 30 years old, must have been a U.S. citizen for at least nine years and must be a resident of the state he or she represents. Salary: $137,700. Term: six years. Duties include voting on legislation in Congress and helping constituents deal with the federal government.
A U.S. representative must be at least 25 years old, must have been a U.S. citizen for at least seven years and must be a resident of the state he or she represents. Salary: $133,600. Term: two years. Duties include voting on legislation in Congress and helping constituents deal with the federal government.
Here are the questions that the candidates were asked by the Orlando Sentinel:
LEGISLATION: If you could push through only one peice of legislation, what would it be?
SOCIAL SECURITY: Which approaches to ensuring the long-term survival of Social Security do you favor?
- Raise Social Security taxes.
- Raise the retirement age.
- Tax a larger share of benefits.
- Invest Social Security money in the stock market.
- Reduce benefits.
If none of the above, how would you deal with government projections that, without action, the program will go broke?
MEDICARE: What steps do you favor to ensure the long-term survival of Medicare?
- Raise Medicare premiums.
- Reduce benefits.
- Cut payments to health-care providers.
- Means test the program so that affluent retirees pay higher premiums than those with lower incomes.
If none of the above, how would you deal with government projections that, without action, the program will go broke?
PUERTO RICO: Do you favor giving Puerto Ricans the right to vote on whether the commonwealth should become the 51st state? If they vote yes, should Congress automatically accept the results and vote for statehood?
IMMIGRATION: Should the level of legal immigration be raised, held steady or cut? Should immigration law give priority to reuniting families or allowing immigration to those people with skills and education?
TOBACCO: Should taxes on cigarettes be raised to finance a tobacco settlement? And, if so, by how much?
TAXES: Would you replace the current federal income-tax system with either a flat tax or national sales tax? If so, what would you do to ensure that the new system would bring in enough revenue to keep the government functioning and would not disrupt the economy?
ENVIRONMENT: Should the Senate ratify the global-warming treaty, which would require the United States to reduce greenhouse gases by 7 percent from 1990 levels?
Charlie Crist
Republican St. Petersburg Age: 42 Occupation: Lawyer Education: Bachelor's degree from Florida State University, law degree from Cumberland School of Law LEGISLATION: Eliminate the IRS code and replace it with either a flat tax or a national sales tax.
SOCIAL SECURITY: I will never vote to take away benefits owed to our seniors. I view Social Security as a contract that can never be broken. Seniors deserve 100 percent of their benefits. Using some of the budget surplus to make Social Security stable will fix any difficulties.
MEDICARE: The best way to ensure long-term survival of Medicare is to attack fraud and waste in the system. I would not vote to raise premiums, reduce benefits or use means testing. Where appropriate, I would favor cutting payments to health-care providers.
PUERTO RICO: No.
IMMIGRATION: The current level of immigration should be held steady. Priority should be given to both people with skills and those who are trying to reunite with their families. We should focus our attention on controlling our borders and illegal immigration.
TOBACCO: No, the tobacco companies should pay. The consumers should not.
TAXES: I want to abolish the IRS code and institute either a flat tax or a national sales tax. I would encourage a great national debate on the new system. A transition must be done responsibly.
ENVIRONMENT: Not until the theory has been proven that we really have a problem.
Bob Graham
Democrat Miami Lakes Age: 62 Occupation: Senator Education: B.A., University of Florida, J.D., Harvard Law School LEGISLATION: The one piece of legislation that I would enact increases the quality of care in HMOs, strengthens Medicare and expands access to preventative health-care services. Patients who are enrolled in HMOs should expect and demand quality care from their physicians without interference from insurance bureaucrats. They should have comparative information about the care they are receiving, access to an independent appeals process, and a choice of doctors. Medicare should be strengthened by eliminating fraud and encouraging long-term care. Finally, this legislation increases access to preventative-care services, such as screenings for osteoporosis, and breast and colon cancer.
SOCIAL SECURITY: We should resist the temptation to spend today's Social Security surplus on tax breaks. Any reform of Social Security should be a part of a larger context of retirement security, which has three key components: pensions, personal savings and Social Security. Of those three, Social Security is a safety net for retirement security and, therefore, should feature the least risk to participants.
MEDICARE: The Medicare program should be refocused to reflect the realities of older Americans. First, more emphasis should be placed on preventing illnesses. Second, access to long-term care should be expanded by merging similar programs within the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Third, Medicare recipients who use HMOs should be guaranteed high-quality care and access to emergency services. Finally, reforms should be made to eliminate fraud in Medicare.
PUERTO RICO: I have sponsored bipartisan legislation that will give the 3.8 million U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico the right to determine their political future: continued commonwealth status, statehood or independence. If this legislation is enacted and the citizens of Puerto Rico vote for statehood, I will support their inclusion as the 51st state in our union.
IMMIGRATION: The fundamental immigration problem today is with illegal immigrants, not legal immigrants. To address this problem, I have supported efforts to control our borders. In terms of legal immigration, I agree with the current policy, which prioritizes family reunification. In addition, I have supported other forms of legal immigration that serve a specific purpose. I introduced a bill that will provide Florida's farmers with a legal method to meet their seasonal labor requirements if adequate numbers of U.S. workers are not available. I also support legislation that would allow some high- skilled workers to legally work in the United States if there are not U.S. workers available.
TOBACCO: The United States should commit to a program that will reduce underage smoking. Each day, 3,000 children begin smoking - 1,000 of whom will die as a result. The tobacco industry should pay on a national basis, as it has already done in Florida, to reimburse the government for health-care costs related to smoking and for education programs to warn children about the dangers of tobacco. Earlier this year, I sponsored legislation to increase the price of cigarettes by $1.50 a pack. It is estimated that such an increase would reduce teenage smoking by more than 60 percent.
TAXES: I support a simpler, flatter tax system. The current code is complicated and confusing. But I do not support the risky notion of throwing out the entire tax code at once, which could disrupt families and businesses. We took a step in the right direction this year, with the bipartisan reform of the IRS, to make the IRS more consumer-oriented. We should simplify the tax code by tackling a section at a time.
ENVIRONMENT: The Senate should not ratify the global-warming treaty until we receive commitments from developing countries that they will reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions. As currently written, the treaty is not balanced. It requires the United States and other developed countries to carry the burden of meeting a worldwide challenge. I supported a resolution that called for scheduled commitments from developing nations as a prerequisite for Senate ratification of this treaty. Meaningful participation from these nations is critical for reducing the impacts of climate change, while retaining a level playing field for international trade.

AWAY FROM THE FRAY, A SPACE OASIS: THE COSTLY INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS READY TO BE BUILT - 220 MILES ABOVE ITS MANY CRITICS.

Full text:   The International Space Station is so big and complicated it will have to be launched in 43 parts and then put together like a giant set of Tinker Toys.
Astronauts will ride the space shuttle to the 220-mile-high construction site, where, working outside in temperatures that can plunge to minus 170 degrees Fahrenheit, they will assemble the various power modules, laboratory spaces and living quarters.
The space station is the most expensive and ambitious planned project since the moon landing. The first piece is scheduled to go up on an unmanned rocket launched from Russia late next month, followed by a connecting module to be ferried aboard the shuttle in early December.
When construction is done, about 2004 in NASA's estimate, the space station will house six astronauts who will stay for periods of three to six months. With them will be a menagerie of experimental creatures - rats, mice, rabbits, insects and zebra fish. The astronauts will also conduct experiments by growing crystals and tending to plants, and will act as guinea pigs for medical experiments.
Before humans can venture farther into space, the thinking goes, scientists need to learn more about the way people fare when exposed to the radiation, weightlessness and possible hazards out there. Some information was gathered from the Russian space station Mir, launched in 1986. Spaceflight throws off balance, degrades the organs, thins the blood, wastes the muscles, and dissolves the skeleton.
Critics say the International Space Station, a 16-country project, will not do enough science to justify the cost to the United States of $30 billion or more. The station won't ever venture out into the solar system from its permanent height of 220 miles, and the astronauts on board will make it too jiggly to be a platform for telescopes looking out into the heavens.
``For NASA to set its sights at 220 miles above the Earth is a failure of leadership and imagination,'' said Robert Zubrin, founder of a grassroots movement, Mars Direct, promoting human travel to Mars.
Since NASA began seriously promoting the idea of a space station in the early 1980s, prominent scientists and whole scientific societies have waged battle against it.
The General Accounting Office and outside panels of scientists have tabulated costs above $90 billion - far greater than NASA's estimate. And recently NASA has acknowledged that the Russians failed to produce many of the parts they promised, forcing the United States to absorb more of the costs.
Critics also point out that NASA launched a space station called Skylab in 1973, and by 1974 had already abandoned it. ``They couldn't think of anything to do with it,'' said physicist Robert Park of the American Physical Society. In 1979, Skylab fell from its orbit and landed in bits and pieces over the Indian Ocean.
The controversy over the currently planned station sits at the center of a wider debate on the merits of exploring the universe with astronauts, who are fragile and vulnerable, versus robotic probes, which cost less and can venture farther.
Those in favor of manned spaceflight argue that it is humankind's destiny to explore and colonize space, building civilizations on the moon and Mars. They compare it to the settling of the New World.
NASA does not emphasize conquering the universe as the primary motivation behind the space station. But colonization is a quasi-religious sentiment that pervades support for the station both inside and outside of the agency.
The purpose of a space station was much clearer during the 1980s, when the Russians were planning Mir. They had already launched a station, Salyut 1, in 1971. The notion of Soviet dominance in space was considered a threat to our national security.
Early plans for a U.S. station - which would be called Freedom - focused on international competition, both military and industrial. When President Ronald Reagan officially announced Space Station Freedom in 1984, he promised that it would promote America's industrial spirit.
NASA set up a vision of dozens of companies rushing to invest in the space station as a base of space manufacturing.
Martin Glicksman, a materials researcher at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., said he remembered when NASA was trying to get people excited about ball bearings.
NASA engineers were promoting the idea that, in space, you could make ball bearings of heavenly perfection.
``They overlooked the reality of the way metals solidify,'' Glicksman said. Space wouldn't yield perfect ball bearings after all - and even if it did, he said, ``at $10,000 a kilogram, who cares?''
Congress nearly killed funding for the space station several times, and the existing plan was completely scrapped for a slimmed-down version drawn up in 1993. By that time, more than $10 billion had been spent on the project and not a single piece had been built.
Soon, however, contractors around the country began to put hammer to metal, and now about half of the million some-odd pounds of space-station components are waiting for further assembly.
With the Cold War over, NASA shifted the proposed aim of the project to biology and materials science. NASA says space-station research will lead to better materials of all sorts and medical breakthroughs. NASA spokesman Dwayne Brown estimates ``we'll get $2 back for every $1 on the investment.''
Many scientists don't buy it.
``The space station has nothing to do with materials science,'' said Rustum Roy, a Pennsylvania State University materials researcher. His dim view of space research is based on experience. In the 1980s, he flew an experiment on the space shuttle for growing crystals of triglycine sulfate, useful for infrared-light detection, a project he now calls ``a waste of money.''
``I have never seen one honest example of an advance in materials'' developed from space, he said. ``You can do things expensively that would be done much more cheaply from the ground.''
Another area of research touted by NASA is a branch of biology known as protein crystallography. In the body, proteins come in thousands of varieties, each one with a unique shape determining its function. Using crystallized proteins, scientists can study how the body works at the molecular level.
Not all proteins are easy to crystallize, and for a time, some proteins could be crystallized better in space.
But recent breakthroughs in molecular biology have rendered space-based research much less useful. Last summer, the American Society for Cell Biology reported that space-based crystal experiments had ``made no serious contributions to scientific knowledge'' and concluded that there was no justification for continuing them.
Other scientists argue that the space station is a good project, but that NASA is stressing the wrong purpose. The space station should not be thought of as a research facility at all, but rather as a step toward human space exploration, where some limited science can piggyback.
``You wouldn't want to pay $30 billion for a space laboratory,'' Rensselaer's Glicksman said, ``but if you're already going to have a space station, then, yes, there are some wonderful experiments that can be done on it.''
He is optimistic about continuing a line of research he began on the space shuttle - the study of microscopic treelike growths called dendrites that form in metals and influence the strength and durability of alloys. Results that he has gotten so far from space research, he said, have been incorporated into casting codes used in foundries for making steel and aluminum.
Other experiments would dovetail more directly into the space-exploration dream. Martin Fettman, a veterinarian from Colorado State University, has done shuttle experiments on the loss of red blood cells in rats.
Rats in space, he said, suffer some of the same physical hardships that humans do, so animals can be useful for experimenting on drugs and other techniques to counteract the medical hazards of space.
Fettman is particularly excited about a huge centrifuge to be flown on the space station and designed to spin, thereby simulating gravity. Inside the centrifuge, scientists can create any fraction of Earth's gravity.
By seeing how animals fare inside the centrifuge, Fettman said, scientists will learn whether astronauts would need simulated gravity to go to Mars - a flight that would take at least six months.
Though NASA has no official plan to send humans to Mars, the agency works under the assumption people will eventually explore and colonize the planet and then venture beyond.
``When you take out the political aspect of this, the real purpose of human spaceflight is to lay the groundwork for one day colonizing space,'' said Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astrophysicist who writes a newsletter about the space program.
He argues for space colonization as a sort of insurance plan. ``A single planet is a fragile place,'' he said, subject to asteroid bombardment, global climate change, and even nuclear war.
Others say space exploration, including the space station, fulfills a human need to reach new places - not by way of robots or cyberspace but in person.
``It's not about space, but about Earth and people's ability to do things,'' said Bruce Murray, a planetary scientist and former director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We should have astronauts in space not for the science, he said, but for the ``drama and adventure . . . and the need for the rest of us to vicariously share it.''

Abstract: At present on a world average this costed154 energy is made up of about 76 per cent fossil fuels, 14 per cent biomass (wood etcetera a form of solar energy), 6 per cent hydroelectricity (also a form of solar energy) 4 per cent nuclear and tiny fraction from other solar sources. There are demonstrated solar technologies for chemically storing solar energy to allow 24-hour electricity generation, to produce chemical commodities, to detoxify hazardous waste, to split water to make hydrogen and to make fuels for motor vehicles.

Full text: IT SEEMS that increasingly these days the public agenda is dominated by endless discussion of obscure intangible human inventions such as interest rates, share price indices and so on. In this environment it is easy to lose sight of some rather important fundamentals. Perhaps the most fundamental is energy.
To the human animal as any other, energy means food to keep us alive, heat to keep us warm and energy is also what makes all the trappings of our civilisation possible, transport of goods, information and ourselves and the manufacture of every single object we take for granted.
In the global view 99.99 per cent of the energy that makes life possible is coming from the sun. Turn off the sun and pretty soon we would be trying to live on a lump of rock at close to absolute zero (around -273`C). However the 0.01 per cent which is the stuff that we actually pay154 for in some way is the bit that is causing the world so much angst at the moment. At present on a world average this costed154 energy is made up of about 76 per cent fossil fuels, 14 per cent biomass (wood etcetera a form of solar energy), 6 per cent hydroelectricity (also a form of solar energy) 4 per cent nuclear and tiny fraction from other solar sources.
Much of the debate on the greenhouse issue is about uncertainty. It is worth repeating a few facts which are definitely not uncertain: There is a greenhouse effect without it the average temperature of the planet would be around -19`C. Carbon dioxide, methane and many other gases contribute to the effect.
The concentration of carbon dioxide (and other gases) has beyond doubt increased the proportion of human emissions. The uncertainty arises in trying to determine what the effect of these changes is likely to be on the world's weather systems. The rational approach, when faced with the possibility of an extremely bad outcome with an unknown probability, is to take out some form of insurance. Obvious insurance is to look at ways of reducing gas emissions without compromising standards of living and energy. This leads to the search for renewable (solar) energy technologies.
Greenhouse is not the only reason for pursuing solar energy technologies. Even without it we are faced with a considerable burden of pollution from fossil fuel use and the certainty that some day this will be exhausted. Recent events on the Indian subcontinent serve to remind those who might have forgotten about the Chernobyl accident that a nuclear-based future has major drawbacks.
So what can solar energy do?
The short answer is, everything. There already exist, either commercially or in the laboratory, technologies which can replace every single application of fossil fuel. Everyone knows solar energy can heat water, and many people would already realise that solar energy is sufficient to keep a carefully designed house warm. Most people also know that solar energy can generate electricity.
About 18 per cent of the world's electricity is generated by hydroelectricity a form of solar energy. In 1997 the Danish wind-turbine industry sold enough turbines to generate electricity at a rate of 1 gigawatt (about three times what Canberra uses).
There are in southern California, large solar thermal power systems that together can generate at a rate of 350 megawatts, and 800 megawatts of photovoltaic panels has been installed in small systems around the world.
What many people would not realise is that technologies exist for solar energy to replace other uses of fossil fuel. The key to many of these technologies is solar-driven chemical processes. There are demonstrated solar technologies for chemically storing solar energy to allow 24-hour electricity generation, to produce chemical commodities, to detoxify hazardous waste, to split water to make hydrogen and to make fuels for motor vehicles.
Won't solar energy systems require too much space?
Hardly; on an average of 25 times our yearly costed154 energy needs lands on the surface of the continent. To provide for Australia's consumption of primary costed energy of 5000 petajoules per year in a place like Canberra where about 18 megajoules of sun falls on every square metre on an average day, would require 20 per cent efficient collectors only covering an area of 62km square.
This could really be done with a sensible combination of existing technologies.
What about the energy needed to manufacture solar equipment in the first place?
Making any piece of equipment requires energy, which in turn can result in the emission of greenhouse gases, if fossil fuels are used in the process.
However, commercial solar equipment more than pays for its energy debt154 during its operating life. For example, a solar hot water heater will repay its energy debt in six to 18 months, depending on location as will wind turbines and solar thermal power systems. Isn't Solar energy too expensive?
In its simplest form, solar energy is free. You don't have to pay for the warmth of a summer day, or for the sunlight needed to make the vegetables in your garden grow. There are many ways to utilise solar energy which will pay for themselves.
In other words, the money you will save in the long term on reduced energy bills will more than make up for the initial outlay. Building a solar passive house for example, which is designed to capture the heat from the sun effectively in winter, but keep it out in summer, need not cost any more than a poorly designed house which requires much more energy, and therefore money, to keep comfortable all year round.
Adding insulation into the walls and ceiling of an existing house, too, will pay for itself over a period of a few years as will a solar hot water heater in many circumstances.
The hard nut to crack is large- scale electricity production. While solar technologies are already competitive for electricity production in remote areas, current estimates for existing technology used on a reasonable scale, place them as being two or three times more expensive to the consumer than Australia's current cheap coal-fired electricity. Considering the potential for cost-effective efficiency improvements and future technology developments it is quite plausible to consider making the switch with very little discomfort.
The extra cost154 must also be seen in the context of the potential costs of global climate change. Estimating these is just as uncertain as predicting the changes themselves, but attempts to do so produce numbers that show that the solar technologies are actually cheaper.
In the greenhouse debate much is made of the possible negative effect on the economy that such an increase in costs would have. In considering this issue it should be remembered that this is not money somehow lost from the economy, rather it is money that is directed into major highemployment initiatives in manufacturing new products.
So what is happening in the ACT?
In the research and development arena, a lot is happening in Canberra. At the Australian National University, research groups within the Department of Engineering's Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems are working on solar thermal and photovoltaic power systems, the university's commercial arm, ANUTECH is developing and marketing the world's largest paraboloidal dish and a group within the department of Geology is investigating hot dry rock geothermal power systems.
Work on solar cells promises to significantly reduce the cost of these cells by reducing the amount of high quality silicon needed. Researches are working on two concepts to do this. In the first approach, cells are made from a film of silicon only 30 to 50 thousandth of a millimetre thick using less than a tenth of the silicon of standard cells.
In the second approach, the ANU team is perfecting a system that focuses sunlight from a large area on to a narrow line of solar cells, using mirrors that are much cheaper than solar cells. The solar thermal group within the CSES has pioneered a themochemical energy storage system based on dissociating and re-synthesising ammonia. This system will allow solar thermal systems such as those based around the ANUTECH dish to generate power continuously day and night.
Politically speaking, the ACT Government has led other states and territories in making a minimum energy efficiency (modest though the requirement is) mandatory for new house designs and has adopted a decent target for greenhouse emission reductions of achieving emissions at 1990 levels by 2008 and 20 per cent by 2018. Exactly how this is to be implemented is being decided, hopefully by measures that have a real prospect of achieving the target.
The new millennium
The past 100 years have given us cars, computers, television, space travel and more. The next 100 are certain to be just as exciting and unpredictable. If we take a positive view, it will see mankind taking increasing concern for the quality of life on the only inhabitable planet at our disposal. There will be big changes in the way we provide ourselves with extra energy and solar technology will definitely play an increasing part. As usual though the Bill Gates" of each generation will not be those who wait for someone else to go first, but rather those with the foresight to pick winners at the right time. Solar technologies could well be at the point quite soon. This article was prepared by members of the ACT branch of the ANZ Solar Energy Society.

Are you prepared for a disaster?: [Final Edition]

Abstract: During the first days of the ice storm, our reporters and photographers received vastly different treatment within the newly amalgamated city and the outlying municipalities. In Loyalist and South Frontenac townships, for example, we were invited into meetings and accepted as part of the solution. But in the city, we were made to sit outside closed-door meetings. When officials emerged, no media spokesperson had been appointed. At one point, we were told a press release would be faxed to us. That would have been great - if we had power or a fax machine. The pamphlet is a project co-ordinated by the Kingston, Frontenac Lennox and Addington Health Unit and funded by the Ministry of Community and Social Services. It is a timely publication, as is The Ice Storm book, which The Whig-Standard helped produce. The hard-cover book is a collaboration among nine newspapers. Award-winning Whig-Standard photographers Ian MacAlpine and Michael Lea are among the many contributors. (Ian receives special thanks in the opening pages.) Their dramatic photographs are among more than 200 that capture the fury and the perverse beauty of the storm. The book is now available for sale and we will contribute The Whig's share of the proceeds to local charities.

Full text: As we head into another winter, I've been reminded of the need to be prepared for natural disasters. Three recent events had me thinking about my emergency plans at work and at home.
The first was a conference to which I was invited. The second was the arrival of a pamphlet from the local health unit. And the third is a book about the ice storm last January.
My invitation to the conference was unexpected. The one-day event in Ottawa was sponsored by the Canadian National Committee for the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. I had not heard of the committee or its work and I was unaware that the United Nations General Assembly had declared the 1990s as the international decade for natural disaster reduction.
I was keen to attend, however, because the conference came at a time when Kingston officials had just released a new emergency plan curiously void of any news media involvement. I believe the media provides a vital link to the community in times of crisis, so I was surprised that our input hadn't been sought. I was also disappointed to see that there was no section dealing with the media.
During the first days of the ice storm, our reporters and photographers received vastly different treatment within the newly amalgamated city and the outlying municipalities. In Loyalist and South Frontenac townships, for example, we were invited into meetings and accepted as part of the solution. But in the city, we were made to sit outside closed-door meetings. When officials emerged, no media spokesperson had been appointed. At one point, we were told a press release would be faxed to us. That would have been great - if we had power or a fax machine.
When I attended the conference in Ottawa, I recounted some of our frustrations and learned that other media had encountered similar difficulties, especially with Quebec Hydro. I also heard, however, about success stories where television crews and newspapers in the Ottawa region were given continuous updates and information.
Scientists and insurance representatives at the meeting suggested there could be more natural disasters. The insurance industry is so concerned it has created a group called the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction. Paul Kovacs, executive director, told us that prior to 1987 there had never been a natural disaster causing insured losses of more than $1 billion (US) anywhere in the world. But during the past decade there have been 18 natural disasters of this magnitude or greater.
Factors he attributed to the trend: population growth, urbanization, economic expansion, climate change. His group is interested in ways that loss of life and damage to property can be mitigated.
The local health unit is certainly taking steps to help us be prepared. I was happy this week to receive in my mailbox a pamphlet called Making the Connection. It has useful information about ways to stay healthy during an emergency. There are tips about water, food, carbon monoxide, cold weather conditions, generators and evacuation.
The pamphlet is a project co-ordinated by the Kingston, Frontenac Lennox and Addington Health Unit and funded by the Ministry of Community and Social Services. It is a timely publication, as is The Ice Storm book, which The Whig-Standard helped produce.
The hard-cover book is a collaboration among nine newspapers. Award-winning Whig-Standard photographers Ian MacAlpine and Michael Lea are among the many contributors. (Ian receives special thanks in the opening pages.) Their dramatic photographs are among more than 200 that capture the fury and the perverse beauty of the storm. The book is now available for sale and we will contribute The Whig's share of the proceeds to local charities.
One quotation in the book exemplifies the pride we can take in how we responded last year, but also the need to be more vigilant in our emergency preparation: "The storm and its aftermath reminded us of some immutable truths - of our fragility, of nature's strength and of our remarkable ability to pull together in times of need."
Mayor Gary Bennett designated last Thursday as Emergency Preparedness Day. It's a good time for all of us to ask how prepared we are.

Full text: MORE Government funding was needed to help minimise the future impact of the El Nino weather system, which is estimated to have cost New Zealand more than $1 billion this year, scientists and industry figures said yesterday.
Representatives of the science, farming, energy, and environmental sectors were taking part in a workshop in Wellington on how New Zealand can better prepare for future El Nino events.
Participants called for greater government involvement in long- term climate forecasting. Some wanted an official climate forecasting agency to help farmers and other stakeholders prepare for El Nino, which this year caused devastating draughts along much of the east coast.
Some suggested that initially only a few hundred thousand dollars were needed, but others said greater funding was needed. Such funding would be an investment in the future as a wide range of sectors, not just farmers, suffered the effects of El Nino.
Participants also called for better communication between climate experts and farmers and members of other affected sectors. These sectors could include insurance, biosecurity and health.
The ideas were discussed at El Nino: Lessons and Opportunities for the Future, a workshop organised by the Royal Society's New Zealand climate committee.
Judy Lawrence, of the National Science Strategy Committee on Climate Change, said the economy "totally and utterly depends" on the climate. Policymakers and scientists needed to work more closely together to manage climatic risks.
Rob Davison, of the Economic Service of Meat and Wool Boards, said climatic forecasting was crucial to farmers. About 32,000 farms were potentially affected by El Nino and reliable information was needed to help farmers minimise their losses.
ECNZ Spokesman Russell Howie said the 1992 El Nino event had carved $100 million from the company's bottom-line profit.

Energy, environment ministers act on acid rain

Abstract: Since 1980, Canada has cut its acid rain emissions - primarily sulphur dioxide - by 54 per cent.

Full text: Canada's energy and environment ministers have agreed to a renewed attack in the new millennium on the pollutants that cause acid rain.
As part of the agreement, four provinces - Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick - will negotiate new targets and timetables for further reductions in acid rain emissions over the next year.
The commitment was announced yesterday in Halifax at a federal-provincial meeting of energy and environment ministers.
The new acid rain program is being developed in response to a task force report that suggested further cuts of up to 75 per cent are needed to stem the damaging effects of acid rain on Canada's lakes and forests.
The report found that while both Canada and the United States are ahead of their current targets, acidity levels remain stubbornly high in lakes in Ontario, Quebec and Eastern Canada. Acid rain can stunt tree growth, damage buildings and destroy the ecological balance of lakes, making it difficult for waterfowl like loons to feed and lay eggs.
The new reduction targets will take effect after 2000 when Canada's current acid rain program expires.
"Today's signature by all provincial governments is a formal commitment that we in Canada will do our share to solve the acid rain problem," said Environment Minister Christine Stewart.
"We consider this an important opportunity to put our own house in order to take advantage of the current interest in the United States in achieving further emission reductions.
Since 1980, Canada has cut its acid rain emissions - primarily sulphur dioxide - by 54 per cent. Yet the damage to lakes and wildlife caused by acid rain has not subsided, in part because the U.S. has been slower to reduce its emission levels. The U.S., which is responsible for half of the acid rain that falls in Canada, has so far reduced its emissions by 30 per cent.
Its current program calls for a total reduction of 40 per cent by 2010, although current revisions to the U.S. Clean Air Act could trigger further cuts.
Meanwhile, the federal government also unveiled yesterday details of its three- year, $150-million action plan on climate change.
More than one-third of the funds ($56-million) will be used to support the development of technology that enhances energy efficiency.
The rest of the money will go toward improving climate science ($15-million), assessing the potential for emission reductions in Canada ($34-million) and educating Canadians on the need for action ($30-million). A reserve of $15- million has also been established.
"Our message to Canadians is this: Acting now is like investing in an insurance policy to protect the environment and the economy, for ourselves and our future generations," said Natural Resources Minister Ralph Goodale.
Environmentalists, however, complain that the government's climate insurance policy is too meagre.
"This isn't a plan to achieve the Kyoto protocol, it's a minimal first step," said Robert Hornung of the Pembina Institute for Appropriate Development.
Most scientists believe the earth's atmosphere is slowly being warmed as man- made gases like carbon dioxide absorb heat that would otherwise escape into outer space. The gases, produced largely through the burning of coal, oil and gasoline, were the subject of a treaty negotiated last year in Kyoto, Japan.
The treaty, which must still be ratified by Canada and other industrialized nations, commits the developed world to reducing its collective emissions of greenhouse gases by at least 5 per cent. Canada agreed to cut its emissions by 6 per cent over 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.

Abstract: WETTER winters in Scotland and drier summers in the south-east are more likely as the UK experiences a three degree temperature rise by the end of the next century. A climate change report from scientists at the University of East Anglia and experts at the Hadley Centre, part of the Meteorological Office, also warns of a greater risk of flooding, sea levels rising between two to ten centimetres per decade and extreme weather patterns with gales and very hot days sending the thermometer over 25C. There is also the possibility of a complete absence of frost in coastal areas.

Full text: WETTER winters in Scotland and drier summers in the south-east are more likely as the UK experiences a three degree temperature rise by the end of the next century.
The impact of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere will lead to droughts, flooding and storms with cities such as Glasgow and Manchester- already famous for high rainfall - likely to get more downpours.
A climate change report from scientists at the University of East Anglia and experts at the Hadley Centre, part of the Meteorological Office, also warns of a greater risk of flooding, sea levels rising between two to ten centimetres per decade and extreme weather patterns with gales and very hot days sending the thermometer over 25C. There is also the possibility of a complete absence of frost in coastal areas.
The report by the UK Climate Impacts Programme for the first time enables water companies, insurance firms, local authorities, industry and farmers, to make plans for dealing with the changes.
Dr Mike Hulme, of the University of East Anglia, said winter rainfall would increase, particularly in the north and with greater intensity. "Manchester is going to get wetter and we anticipate more downpours. This is an evolution of the science we have been reporting for some years."
Michael Meacher, the environment minister, said it showed the potential for UK climate to change and the need to prepare for it.
"These scenarios illustrate the very real threat that climate change represents to us in the UK and underlines the importance that the Government attaches to meeting its targets and tackling the threat of climate change in the long run."
Earlier he said that a three degree rise may not sound much but "when I say that at the last Ice Age, the temperature fell by only five degrees Centigrade, clearly a rise in temperature of three degrees can have an enormous effect".
Anna Stanford, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: "Mr Meacher is right to draw attention to the catastrophic impacts of climate change and the need to take action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. But we've known about this problem for some time. Now we need to see actiona"

Abstract: Temperatures in the UK could rise by as much as 3{0}C over the next century, increasing the frequency of floods, severe winter gales and unusually hot days, scientists said yesterday. Michael Meacher, the environment minister, said the findings of a government-commissioned study of future UK weather patterns "illustrate the very real threat that climate change poses to the UK". Researchers working for the UK Climate Impacts Programme, based at Oxford University, drew up four scenarios for the UK's climate, using differing projections of greenhouse gases and climate sensitivities.

Full text: Temperatures in the UK could rise by as much as 3{0}C over the next century, increasing the frequency of floods, severe winter gales and unusually hot days, scientists said yesterday.
Michael Meacher, the environment minister, said the findings of a government-commissioned study of future UK weather patterns "illustrate the very real threat that climate change poses to the UK".
Researchers working for the UK Climate Impacts Programme, based at Oxford University, drew up four scenarios for the UK's climate, using differing projections of greenhouse gases and climate sensitivities.
Under all the possibilities considered by the scientists, the UK's climate would change significantly. "We no longer believe past weather statistics are an adequate guide to the future," said Dr Mike Hulme of the University of East Anglia who is one of the report's authors.
The likely impact of climate change will differ between the north and south. By 2080, temperatures are likely to increase between 1.5{0}C and 3.2{0}C from 1961-90 levels in the south-east, compared with 1.2{0}C to 2.6{0}C in Scotland.
Winters and autumns will become up to 20 per cent wetter over the whole UK. In spring and summer, the south-east will become drier and the north-west wetter.
"Extreme" events will become more common. Intense downpours will become more frequent, especially in winter. Summer gales and severe winter gales will become a little more frequent. Under one scenario, an August as hot as 1997 - the second hottest on record - will occur on average four times a decade by the 2080s.
Dr Hulme said some of the study's findings, such as increased frequency of severe gales, had serious implications for the construction and insurance industries.
Changing weather patterns also posed a challenge to water management in the south-east. Agriculture will also be affected. In parts of southern England, for example, frosts might cease by the end of the next century.
The researchers believe the report represents "a balanced account of the best information currently available on the future climate of the UK". But they acknowledge the possibility that changes to the UK climate could be more rapid than any of the scenarios they studied.
For example, although their models do not predict dramatic changes to the strong ocean currents that transport heat around the world, the possibility must be taken seriously, they say.
The work was based on climate-modelling experiments by the Met Office's Hadley Centre and studies of greenhouse gas emissions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Mr Meacher said the government would soon publish a consultation paper addressing climate change, as a follow-up to the greenhouse gas reduction targets agreed at last year's Kyoto summit. Measures would include improved energy efficiency in industry and the home, reduced transport emissions and greater use of renewable energy. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998.

UN can cure 'global contagion'

Abstract: Mr. Annan has described the role of the UN in business in clear and powerful terms which bear repeating in these troubled times: As national economies become more and more interdependent through information, trade, investment and financial ties, the UN is helping to fill a growing need for international cooperation and regulatory consistency to spread the benefits of globalization and to avoid chaos and backlash. It prepares the ground for investment in emerging economies, by promoting political stability and good governance, battling corruption and human rights abuses, urging sound economic policies and business-friendly legislation, and working to improve health, education and social well-being.

Full text: We wanted it so badly, we strong- armed nations into going for it. Now, we are all standing around, some scratching our heads, others rubbing them to make the pain go away. Globalization. "Market contagion." That's what nation after nation called the current mess during the debate of the UN Second Committee (Economic and Financial) on the world economic situation.
In Canada, Finance Minister Paul Martin made an economic statement which some say was heavily inspired by Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Like a good pater familia, the PM is battening down the hatches for bad times ahead by ordering that all of the "first-in-a-generation-surplus" go to reducing the national debt. This will still appeal to Mr. Martin's constituency, however, since it is one of the policy decisions that big business and the investment community recommended, instead of spending on repairing our slashed safety net.
Mr. Martin appears not to get all that he wanted, but, as he is fond of saying himself, "make no mistake," he will manage to get the rest somehow. He will allocate funds to health care so that it does not make the Liberals lose seats in the next election. This might even be helpful in Quebec, where Jean Charest is running on criticism of Lucien Bouchard's government's handling of the health file. It would not do for Mr. Bouchard to point out that it was the federal cuts which put the health system in Quebec where it is, which is in a mess, as it is in every other province and territory in Canada.
Mr. Martin will get to reduce taxes on consumers so that more money is available to kick the economy in the slats and make it turn over a bit. He will be able to do this, because he appropriated the Unemployment Insurance program's funds to fashion his so-called surplus.
He at least honestly admits that the world economic situation is threatening all the good results of our sacrifices. But, he contends that Canada is in a better situation than most countries to weather the storm, because of these sacrifices. I hope so, but I doubt it.
Canada will not be taking up its newly won seat on the UN Security Council until the beginning of 1999. However, there is much it can do even now, as an in-coming member of that chamber of decision to deal with the millennium plague -- this market contagion.
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said that Canada would push social issues to the fore, on the Security Council. With Kofi Annan at the helm of the United Nations, Canada has the greatest ally to enable it to make another world class contribution (as with peacekeeping) to deal with what ails the planet. We are not used to thinking of the UN as playing this role. But, as part of his "quiet revolution" to renew the United Nations for the 21st century, Secretary- General Annan is building a stronger relationship with the business community. "Thriving markets and human security go hand in hand; without one, we will not have the other," he has repeatedly said.
Mr. Annan has described the role of the UN in business in clear and powerful terms which bear repeating in these troubled times: "As national economies become more and more interdependent through information, trade, investment and financial ties, the UN is helping to fill a growing need for international cooperation and regulatory consistency to spread the benefits of globalization and to avoid chaos and backlash.
"It prepares the ground for investment in emerging economies, by promoting political stability and good governance, battling corruption and human rights abuses, urging sound economic policies and business-friendly legislation, and working to improve health, education and social well-being."
The UN addresses the down side of globalization by fighting transnational crime, the traffic in drugs, arms and people, and other "problems without passports." Much of its operational work in over 170 countries is aimed at combating poverty. These efforts reduce tensions, prevent backlash and help build future markets
"The UN is working to solve global environmental problems, something which free markets, left to themselves, cannot do. It is tackling transboundary problems like climate change, ozone depletion, toxic waste, loss of forests and species, and air and water pollution.
Unless these problems are addressed, markets and economies will not be sustainable in the long term -- they are depleting the natural "capital" on which growth, and human survival, are based.
Globalizing markets rely on contractual and trust-based relationships built on shared values. Since its inception, the UN's primary mission has been to advocate universal values: freedom, justice and the peaceful resolution of disputes; social progress and better standards of living; equality, tolerance and dignity. The global acceptance and spread of these values is forging a common understanding that is paving the way for markets to expand and take root.
"As a place where business can make its voice heard and engage in dialogue with policy-makers and other stakeholders from all countries, the UN can bring the private sector to the table to solve global problems as partners rather than adversaries."
In Canada, both friends and foes are faulting NDP leader Alexa McDonough for courting small business. They feel it is a betrayal of the principles of social democracy. How wrong they are. Just look at what the UN's promotion of development programs, which extend credit to poor people to start their own businesses, has accomplished.
The MicroStart project so far is up and running in 15 countries. The UN Industrial Development Organization, acting as a broker between technology suppliers and developing countries, has brought over a billion dollars worth of investment and clean technologies to more than 80 countries in the last four years.
So, go baby, go, as U.S. anchorman Walter Cronkite said to John Glenn on his first loop into space and repeated for Mr. Glenn's second foray at the age of 72. Canada will be right there at the table, ready to provide a second Mike Pearson-class contribution to the world. This time it would not only bring glory to the nation, but direct relief and protection from the millennium plague.

Abstract: In the end, the environmental deals were sweetened with money for both sides. The White House said it won an additional $476 million for favored programs involving climate change, water quality and conservation lands. At the same time, Republican lawmakers won provisions to spend millions more on items that include logging and transportation projects in Alaska and an expansion of federal flood insurance and probably development for 75 acres of coastal Florida.

Full text: President Clinton claimed victory Thursday in a last-minute budget battle over proposed changes in environmental policy.
But many environmental activists were in no mood to celebrate. They felt they lost major fights across the country.
Based on what budget negotiators told activists, wins and losses followed geographic lines, with environmentalists mostly prevailing on proposals involving the Pacific Northwest and Republicans and their business allies prevailing in most other regions.
In the end, the environmental deals were sweetened with money for both sides. The White House said it won an additional $476 million for favored programs involving climate change, water quality and conservation lands. At the same time, Republican lawmakers won provisions to spend millions more on items that include logging and transportation projects in Alaska and an expansion of federal flood insurance and probably development for 75 acres of coastal Florida.
Congress agreed to increase spending on the president's clean water proposals, including controls on polluted runoff from farms, to $1.7 billion, $150 million more than Congress had proposed.
Spending from the federal trust fund that pays for land acquisition would increase to $325 million, $55 million more than last year.
Activists said they were disappointed that provisions in the budget would delay by a year environmental regulations on mining. Also, it will delay by eight months an increase in the royalties oil companies pay for drilling on public lands.

Long-term weather forecast: havoc: Ice Storm '98, history's costliest natural disaster per-capita, just tip of the iceberg: insurance industry: [Final Edition]

Author: Butler, Don

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/long-term-weather-forecast-havoc-ice-storm-98/docview/240198765/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Mr. [Paul Kovacs] said the ice storm triggered insurance claims of $1.75 billion, $1.44 billion of which were in Canada. That puts the damage in the same relative league as history's costliest storm, Hurricane Andrew, which generated claims totalling $15 billion in the United States, a nation with 10 times Canada's population. Between the ice storm, the Red River flood of 1997 and the Saguenay flood of 1996, the past three years have been the worst ever for weather-related insurance claims in Canada, Mr. Kovacs said. "We've simply never seen anything like the last few years. The trend is extremely disturbing." Before 1998, Mr. Kovacs said Canadian insurers had never paid out more than $500 million for natural disaster claims in any single year. Costs related to natural disasters are 65 per cent higher in the past five years than in the previous five-year period. And though there had been just one natural disaster causing insured losses of more than $1 billion prior to 1987, Mr. Kovacs said that there have more than 20 such storms worldwide in the past decade.

Full text: On a per-capita basis, last January's ice storm was one of the most costly natural disasters in recorded history, the executive director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction said yesterday.
And the insurance industry expects that severe weather-related events will occur even more often in coming years, Paul Kovacs told an Ottawa breakfast marking International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction Day.
Mr. Kovacs said the ice storm triggered insurance claims of $1.75 billion, $1.44 billion of which were in Canada. That puts the damage in the same relative league as history's costliest storm, Hurricane Andrew, which generated claims totalling $15 billion in the United States, a nation with 10 times Canada's population.
"Adjusted for the size of the country, on a per-capita basis, the ice storm was one of the biggest events any society has had to go through," he said. Insurance companies received an unprecedented 700,000 claims for storm-related damage.
Between the ice storm, the Red River flood of 1997 and the Saguenay flood of 1996, the past three years have been the worst ever for weather-related insurance claims in Canada, Mr. Kovacs said. "We've simply never seen anything like the last few years. The trend is extremely disturbing."
Before 1998, Mr. Kovacs said Canadian insurers had never paid out more than $500 million for natural disaster claims in any single year. Costs related to natural disasters are 65 per cent higher in the past five years than in the previous five-year period. And though there had been just one natural disaster causing insured losses of more than $1 billion prior to 1987, Mr. Kovacs said that there have more than 20 such storms worldwide in the past decade.
Mr. Kovacs said there are four main reasons why the insurance industry expects this trend to continue and worsen.
- Demographics. "There are simply more people living close together in large urban communities," Mr. Kovacs said.
That raises the potential for damage in the event of a weather- related disaster.
- Economic prosperity. With the population generally wealthier than it has been in the past, "we've got more things to be damaged."
- Aging infrastructure. Deficit reduction by governments at all levels means that there has been little re-investment in things such as sewer systems. As a result, many systems are deteriorating and inadequate to meet present demands.
- Climate change. "There is no question that the weather is changing, and that some aspects of that change are leading to more severe weather than we've ever seen," said Mr. Kovacs.
While the full implications of climate change are still unclear, Environment Canada modelling supports the view that Canadians can expect more episodes of extreme weather in the next few decades, said John Stone, Environment Canada's director general of Policy, Program and International Affairs.
Historically, weather-related claims have accounted for only about two per cent of all insurance claims, said Mr. Kovacs. That figure has now risen to 10 per cent.
Mr. Kovacs said weather-related claims "are not big enough yet that we've had to seriously look at the cost of insurance," but warned that that could change if costs continue to rise.
The insurance industry is worried enough that it established the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction earlier this year. Its mission is to explore ways to reduce the loss of life and property caused by severe weather and earthquakes.
In co-operation with Emergency Preparedness Canada, the institute has spent the last few months holding workshops across the country with representatives of government, the private sector, non-profit groups and academics to develop a framework to mitigate natural disaster risks.
"We don't have a co-ordinated overall effort to focus on being ready for crises in this country," said Mr. Kovacs. While there is no agreement on what to do, he said there was broad consensus among workshop participants that investments are needed to mitigate the damage caused by natural disasters when they occur.
Mr. Kovacs said these investments can be very cost effective. "A small investment initially can lead to major savings down the road."
For example, the insurance industry has spent $1.5 million a year for the past three years to divert hail-storms away from Calgary, using cloud-seeding techniques. As a result, he said, "the damage caused by hail in Calgary has gone down remarkably."
The consultations will culminate in a national conference in Toronto on Dec. 2, at which the results of the workshops will be reported to federal and provincial ministers. Emergency Preparedness Canada is expected to be empowered to investigate measures to reduce the damage caused by natural disasters, something not currently within its mandate.

Abstract: Paul R. Epstein, MD, MPH, is associate director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School. The center will host a New England Town Meeting on climate change Saturday at Faneuil Hall. As a November meeting in Buenos Aires on climate approaches, some members of Congress are trying to block any energy-saving solution that echoes the principles of the agreement hashed out in Kyoto last year to reduce global warming -- even if these measures are good for our well-being and our economy. For example, the House Appropriations Committee has blocked the administration from promoting energy-saving measures and incentives for new technologies. Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee wants to have veto power over any money the White House spends to get developing countries to participate in the Kyoto protocol. That's certainly a Catch-22, for the Senate voted last year in Kyoto to sign the treaty unless developing nations participate.

Full text:   Paul R. Epstein, MD, MPH, is associate director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School. The center will host a New England Town Meeting on climate change Saturday at Faneuil Hall.
A ferocious but little-publicized policy war looms between the White House and the Republican Congress over the future of the earth's environment.
As a November meeting in Buenos Aires on climate approaches, some members of Congress are trying to block any energy-saving solution that echoes the principles of the agreement hashed out in Kyoto last year to reduce global warming -- even if these measures are good for our well-being and our economy.
For example, the House Appropriations Committee has blocked the administration from promoting energy-saving measures and incentives for new technologies. Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee wants to have veto power over any money the White House spends to get developing countries to participate in the Kyoto protocol. That's certainly a Catch-22, for the Senate voted last year in Kyoto to sign the treaty unless developing nations participate.
This obstruction comes just as the world is experiencing a period of the most unhealthy and costly harsh weather in decades. Accumulating research indicates that these changes in the earth's climate are attributable to the burning of fossil fuels, rather than to natural variability.
Predictably, the congressmen who are blocking efforts to reduce global warming are those who favor the interests of the fossil fuel industries, which are intent on extracting and selling all the buried oil and coal they can well into the next century.
The petroleum and coal industries -- and those who represent their interests -- want voters to distrust their own instincts and experiences about climate changes. They want voters to doubt clear explanations accepted by a consensus of the world's leading scientists.
There is plenty of empirical evidence that something odd is happening with our weather. Areas such as Florida and Texas and Mexico and India have experienced prolonged heat waves, droughts, and fires. Meanwhile, China and Bangladesh (not to mention many of the same places that were hit with droughts, including Texas, Mexico, and India) are deluged by intense rains and flooding.
In many regions, extreme weather has spawned clusters of water- and mosquito-borne diseases, such as cholera and malaria. Heat is building up in ocean surfaces, and there is evidence of deep ocean warming, which may explain the intensity of recent El Nino-related weather events.
More atmospheric water vapor also means warmer nights, as clouds block escaping heat. Insects like these changes, but humans, animals, and plants need relief at night. Warmer winters and warming at high elevations have turned traditional winter snows into winter rains -- leaving sheets of ice when a cold snap hits.
The warmer winters and earlier springs also spawn more molds and pollens. And higher temperatures and humidity increase the photochemical smog formation fed by burning fossil fuels. More allergens and more smog -- from air pollution and climate change acting together -- could be contributing to the rising rates of asthma.
As our experience suggests, extreme weather events are on the rise. Data from the US National Climatic Data Center indicate that in this century in the United States and most other parts of the world, dry spells and heat waves have become longer, and sudden, intense downpours (more than two inches a day of rain) and flash floods also have increased.
New England has already experienced its share of floods and ice storms, and -- with it's extended coastline -- is vulnerable to the long-term impact of global warming, such as rising sea level and greater storm surges.
But perhaps the most troubling consequence of global warming is the instability of the climate. Ice core records near the end of the last ice age 10,000 years ago indicate that such instability has, in the past, preceded rapid and profound climate changes.
Lately, some elements of the fossil fuel lobby have acknowledged that global warming is occurring. But they insist -- contrary to the weight of scientific opinion -- that the impact will be minimal. Instead, they focus on what they call the "uncertainty" in the science. But common sense suggests that there is far more uncertainty about our future than about the science.
The costs of unstable and severe weather are already mounting. Insurance losses and Federal Emergency Management Agency payouts from weather-related events quadrupled this decade. Even higher costs are in store if warmer temperatures do, as some predict, give rise to more weather extremes and associated disease outbreaks that can disrupt trade, transport, and tourism.
Fossil fuel dependence is an addiction from which we must wean ourselves. Looking at the full "life-cycle" of fossil fuels -- their extraction, mining, refining, transport, and combustion -- it is clear they are neither healthy for the environment nor for its inhabitants.
Granted, transition to clean energy sources will not be easy; money will be needed to jump-start infant industries and accelerate markets for new technologies. But the change is ultimately necessary. Greater energy efficiency and new technologies can generate eventual economic growth in the United States and in the global economy. The cost of inaction could be enormous.
While Washington politicians debate the meaning of climate changes, New England can lead the way in this transition. Powering utility plants in Massachusetts with natural gas, rather than coal or oil -- an initiative by the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group, Clean Water Action, and other groups -- will contribute to a cleaner environment.
Meanwhile, the Clean Buses for Boston Coalition is urging this and other cities to switch from polluting diesel buses to those powered with natural gas (emitting minimal greenhouse gases), electric batteries, or fuel cells. Such buses would decrease soot and smog and possibly asthma -- a disease affecting poor communities most dramatically -- while also decreasing the threat of climate change.
Massachusetts also has a number of solar businesses. Contrary to the fossil fuel industry's contentions, enterprises devising new technologies stand to gain an edge in future global markets.
Farsighted leadership is needed to drive clean development. It is possible to stabilize the climate system, but it will require a 60 to 70 percent reduction in fossil fuel emissions. The money wisely invested in that effort would constitute a global insurance policy.
We face an increasingly uncertain future, with climatic disruption compounded by advancing economic and political instabilities. The obstructionist moves by industry lobbyists and recalcitrant legislators represent a blind path, ignoring the most fundamental scientific, social, and economic challenges we face today. The question before us is not whether but how to develop a transition to clean energy and use it to help stimulate equitable global economic growth.

Abstract: Here is what I want to be reading about: I have just heard that, worldwide, the insurance industry spent an average of $2 billion a year covering severe weather-related damage during the 1980s. And that from 1990 to 1995 it spent an average of $30 billion a year. And it is worried about its future. I want to know more about this and what has been happening since 1995 as severe weather patterns have worsened. I also hear that all of us have been duped by oil- and coal-industry representatives into believing that the impact of global warming on our climate is still a mystery. I now understand that 2,500 research scientists of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change agreed in 1995 that this extreme weather was the result of human activity, and principally from our use of fossil fuels. Is this true? This was a lady of great words whose good heart, warm smiles and inner beauty enriched us all. Godspeed, Caroline [Drewes]. With you up there, heaven will be a lovelier place.

Full text: Too focused on scandal, we miss a serious climatic
threat
I was happy to read the letters to the editor (Oct. 1) lamenting the extensive coverage given to President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and I agreed with them all. I noticed, though, that the writers did not tell you what they actually did want to see covered by your newspaper.
Here is what I want to be reading about: I have just heard that, worldwide, the insurance industry spent an average of $2 billion a year covering severe weather-related damage during the 1980s. And that from 1990 to 1995 it spent an average of $30 billion a year. And it is worried about its future. I want to know more about this and what has been happening since 1995 as severe weather patterns have worsened.
I also hear that all of us have been duped by oil- and coal-industry representatives into believing that the impact of global warming on our climate is still a mystery. I now understand that 2,500 research scientists of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change agreed in 1995 that this extreme weather was the result of human activity, and principally from our use of fossil fuels. Is this true?
If so, it would seem to me that there is a coverup we have been missing by spending so much time investigating Clinton. And the results have been catastrophic.
I am not interested in blaming the coal and oil industry for covering up the truth about global warming. They, like all of us, are trying to survive. I am interested in what we are going to do now. Who will the heroes be? How will we make it through? How will we transform our fossil-fuel economy into a global system of renewable energy? Let's hear this story! Tina Estes Oakland
Caroline Drewes
The death of Caroline Drewes also means the death of a kind of journalism we may not see again. The special qualities she brought to San Francisco newspapers for 60 years will surely and sorely be missed.
Caroline wrote with heart. As a writer and as a person, she cared deeply and wrote with intimacy, affection and truth. Never the hard-boiled news hound, her genteel artistry treated all with respect - including readers. When her stories had unpleasant or unsavory aspects, she skillfully avoided demeaning.
For Caroline, every story became an adventure into her subject, an adventure she could share with readers. Though warned against it, she became emotionally involved with everything she put to paper. At times, she wrote with tears streaming down her cheeks.
This was a lady of great words whose good heart, warm smiles and inner beauty enriched us all. Godspeed, Caroline. With you up there, heaven will be a lovelier place. Tom Eastham Vice president & Western director William Randolph Hearst Foundation (Former Examiner executive editor) San Francisco
Plea for supermarket
As Safeway stands up for applause on its record earnings to its stockholders ("Safeway earnings up 29% in quarter," Business section, Oct. 1), what about the Ocean Avenue and Ingleside neighborhoods that lost their only grocery store (yes, Safeway) in 1994? The large building on the corner of Jules Street and Ocean Avenue sits vacant and our neighborhood still has no supermarket.
Since Petrini's closed a year ago at Stonestown, the Park Merced area has also lost its neighborhood supermarket. Many people in this neighborhood do not drive. Can you imagine grocery shopping on the Muni?
Let's call on Safeway to reopen its Ocean Avenue store and provide free round-trip shuttle service to there from Park Merced. This would provide a wonderful service to our underserved areas. Barbara Commins San Francisco
Papal teaching in S.F.
Stephanie Salter's column, "If Jesus came to San Francisco" (Opinion Page, Sept. 17), suggests that in upholding certain teachings of the Catholic Church, Pope John Paul II is somehow at odds with the teachings of Jesus.
In so doing she ignores the words of Christ: "Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church." Thus did Jesus himself establish the pope as the vicar of Christ on Earth.
Salter is free to reject that fundamental Catholic teaching, as well as any other teachings of the church she chooses not to accept. She is not, however, empowered to rewrite church teachings to conform to her personal ideology. Rick Hinshaw Director of communications Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights New York
Cops' faulty priorities
The bizarre attitude of the San Francisco Police Department regarding the relative threat posed by cars and bikes was never more apparent.
I work as a physician in the emergency department at St. Luke's Hospital. The other night a man ran his car into the back of a parked ambulance and passed out. He was brought into the emergency room and awoke, promptly becoming combative and biting a nurse.
Once he was restrained (no easy task), the police were called. They questioned him and he admitted having done PCP before setting out in his car. The police decided that no serious crime had been committed and left without citing or arresting the man. He was allowed to drive home once he sobered up.
This is shocking. This is outrageous. This is typical.
Any bicyclist in San Francisco can tell you that complaints to the police regarding dangerous drivers are rarely taken seriously or acted upon. It seems cyclists riding in Critical Mass are more dangerous than wildly intoxicated drivers.
I can only hope our patient that evening decides on his own not to drive while on PCP again. Certainly he hasn't had that advice from the police. Michael Treece, M.D. San Francisco
NATO and Serb atrocities
Does anyone remember NATO threatening Serbia a few months ago over Kosovo? What happened to those threats?
Serbia is just completing a mop-up operation on the Albanian population, business as usual murdering women, children and old men with bullets to the back of the head.
Every so often I hear the distant muttering of some NATO general venting indignation over "human rights" violations. Everything is fully documented by a team of international observers who remark daintily on another village full of blasted, sun-bloated corpses.
Does anyone remember that we stopped Slobodan Milosevic and his thugs in Bosnia with a few good aerial attacks? How can we let Serbian butchers repeat the same ethnic cleansing tactics three years later?
Have we lost all capacity for moral response or have Bosnia, Rwanda, Burma, Cambodia and our own butchery in El Salvador completely inured us to suffering and moral outrage? Bruce Skogen Oakland

Full text: Back during China's Shang dynasty, around 3,500 years ago, sages foretold the future by casting oracle bones - the clairvoyant equivalent of crap shooting.
Things have changed somewhat since then, even though predictions are as much in demand as ever, and even though we still send plenty of business to astrologers, tarot-card readers, numerologists, phrenologists, necromancers and psychics of all stripes.
Aside from the traditional soothsayers, we sometimes also heed forecasts based on observations, scientific synthesis and reasoning.
Scientific sages depend not on tea leaves or the positions of planets but on tools like mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, complexity theory, celestial mechanics, geology, economics and epidemiology. Needless to say, scientists discount the naive paradigms of fortune tellers, ancient and modern.
Alas, rational approaches to prediction also fail all too often, and it may be that there are some phenomena for which predictions will remain forever out of reach.
As the stock market lurches between the tugs of bulls and bears, financial analysts armed with statistics and the latest marketing theories throw up their hands in despair when asked to guess what will happen from one day to the next.
Picnic planners know better than to rely on short-term weather forecasts, and meteorologists offer little hope that truly accurate weather predictions for specific places and times will ever be possible.
Relief agencies get little useful help from experts as they try to brace for disasters that might, with equal likelihood, occur tomorrow or a thousand years from now. Understanding the mechanisms of events like earthquakes and volcanoes offers little help in predicting precisely when they will occur.
Geologists have a pretty good idea that earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates, yet the art of earthquake forecasting remains notoriously imprecise.
The largest earthquake in four years - an 8.2-magnitude temblor centered under the ocean between Australia and Antarctica - caught seismologists completely off guard when it shook the sea floor last March 25, and geologists are still puzzled by the quake; it did not occur at the junction of tectonic plates where most quakes occur, but struck within a single plate.
Future seismic surprises, including those causing catastrophic loss of life, seem inevitable.
The tsunami that roared over Papua New Guinea on July 17, killing more than 2,000 people, caught everyone by surprise. Experts excused their failure to warn the population on the ground that a giant tsunami materializes only when a scarcely noticeable wave spawned by an earthquake or some other event far out at sea reaches shallow coastal water. By then it is almost on top of some hapless coast line, leaving no time to prepare.
There have been recent reminders that even in principle, some things are impossible to predict.
Among the puzzles that have perplexed mathematicians and physicists at least since the time of Isaac Newton in the 17th century is the "N-body problem" (sometimes called the "Many-body problem").
One of Newton's monumental discoveries was that any two objects attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distance apart. But when three or more objects - the Sun, the Earth and the Moon, for example - are interacting gravitationally, exact solutions of the equations describing their motions generally remain beyond reach.
Fortunately, since Newton's day, some very good approximate solutions of N-body equations have been devised, and such solutions have allowed space scientists to send vehicles to the distant reaches of the solar system with astounding precision.
This month, Gregory R. Buck of Saint Anselm College, in Manchester, N.H., disclosed a new class of approximate N-body solutions based on the analogy of a closed loop of beads, in which the beads, evenly spaced, chase each other around the curves and tangles of the loop.
The system may help to work out the interactions of particles within a plasma, Buck suggested.
But none of the approximations now known exactly solve Newton's equations, and this means that the motions of asteroids and comets can be predicted only up to a certain point in the distant future. Beyond that, forecasting an impact by one of these objects on the earth may be intrinsically impossible.
A hit or miss may depend so sensitively on the minuscule "initial conditions" of all the objects involved that precise calculation becomes impossible. This is a property of a large class of systems scientists describe as chaotic.
Long-term foreknowledge of the hit or miss - a question of life or death for millions - is ruled out by the chaos inherent in the N-body system.
Scientists have yet to come to terms with chaos in all its manifestations. Steven Weinberg, winner of a Nobel prize in physics, once said he considered an understanding of chaotic turbulence in fluids as the single most intractable problem in physics. Until scientists reach a deeper understanding of turbulence, many physicists believe, the dynamics of climate change, the behavior of galaxies and many other phenomena can never be fully penetrated.
Chaos can also prevent reliable predictions of group decisions, including those that investors make. Group decisions by investors can cause chaotic price fluctuations of commodities that are intrinsically unpredictable, it seems.
In a report published Aug. 24 in the journal Physical Review Letters, David A. Meyer of the University of California at San Diego and Thad A. Brown of the University of Missouri presented formal proof that collective decisions can be chaotic, even when the views of all participants are known and a standard voting rule is strictly applied.
When a group of decision-makers must choose between three or more options by comparing two of them at a time, the collective outcome often depends on the order in which the choices are presented. The outcome can cycle chaotically, the mathematicians found.
Frustrated by the complex and chaotic behavior of the real world, some theorists have invented forecasting techniques based on little more than pure mathematics.
In the 1970s, Rene Thom, a French mathematician, developed an approach called Catastrophe Theory, which, for a time, enjoyed a considerable vogue among physicists, biologists and even sociologists. The theory is an application of topology, a field of mathematics that deals with the shapes of surfaces.
Thom's theory holds that many sequences of events can be represented as smooth trajectories along a saddle-shaped surface, at one point of which an abrupt discontinuity, or "catastrophe cusp," shunts them off to one side of the saddle or the other.
Thom and his followers proposed that mathematical models based on catastrophe cusps could be used to predict the reproduction of bacteria, the behavior of the stock market, heart attacks, biological evolution and the outbreak of war, among many other things.
To some, Thom's theory seemed to offer an explanation of almost everything, but many others condemned it as useless. Today, Catastrophe Theory is all but forgotten.
Predicting lifespans in the absence of detailed knowledge has long interested scientists as well as insurance statisticians. A forecast of life expectancy based on the average age at death of a person's four grandparents is a simple example of statistical forecasting. But a much more daring approach was devised a few years ago by J. Richard Gott III, a professor of astrophysics at Princeton University.
Gott's scheme is based on the "Copernican principle," which assumes that the odds are overwhelmingly against any particular place or time being "special." From this, Gott reasoned that the mere knowledge of how long something (or someone) has been around is sufficient to estimate how much longer it could last.
Based on this system, and the assumption that Homo sapiens appeared on earth about 200,000 years ago, Gott calculated that intelligent human beings are 95 percent certain to survive a minimum of 5,128 years more, and a maximum of 7.8 million years more.
There are those who contend that predictions like these are so vague that they not useful.
Scientists will never be able to answer all our questions about future events or to satisfy a deep-seated human yearning to foresee what's coming at us. Some scientific efforts at prediction will always be defeated by the nature of Nature.
Mystic oracles have never shed light on future events either, but even 1,398 years after Socrates' suicide, legions of people continue to visit palmists, astrologists and psychics. It's human to prefer something to nothing at all.

Alas, rational approaches to prediction also fail all too often, and it may be that there are some phenomena for which predictions will remain forever out of reach.
As the stock market lurches between the tugs of bulls and bears, financial analysts armed with statistics and the latest marketing theories throw up their hands in despair when asked to guess what will happen from one day to the next.
Picnic planners know better than to rely on short-term weather forecasts, and meteorologists offer little hope that truly accurate weather predictions for specific places and times will ever be possible.
Relief agencies get little useful help from experts as they try to brace for disasters that might, with equal likelihood, occur tomorrow or a thousand years from now. Understanding the mechanisms of events like earthquakes and volcanoes offers little help in predicting precisely when they will occur.
Geologists have a pretty good idea that earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates, yet the art of earthquake forecasting remains notoriously imprecise.
The largest earthquake in four years -- an 8.2-magnitude tremor centered under the ocean between Australia and Antarctica -- caught seismologists completely off guard when it shook the sea floor last March 25, and geologists are still puzzled by the quake; it did not occur at the junction of tectonic plates where most quakes occur, but struck within a single plate.
Future seismic surprises, including those causing catastrophic loss of life, seem inevitable.
The tsunami that roared over Papua New Guinea on July 17, killing more than 2,000 people, caught everyone by surprise. Experts excused their failure to warn the population on the ground that a giant tsunami wave materializes only when a scarcely noticeable wave spawned by an earthquake or some other event far out at sea reaches shallow coastal water. By then it is almost on top of some hapless coastline, leaving no time to prepare.
There have been recent reminders that even in principle, some things are impossible to predict.
Among the puzzles that have perplexed mathematicians and physicists at least since the time of Isaac Newton in the 17th century is the ''N-body problem'' (sometimes called the ''Many-body problem'').
One of Newton's monumental discoveries was that any two objects attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distance apart. But when three or more objects -- the Sun, the Earth and the Moon, for example -- are interacting gravitationally, exact solutions of the equations describing their motions generally remain beyond reach.
Fortunately, since Newton's day, some very good approximate solutions of N-body equations have been devised, and such solutions have allowed space scientists to send vehicles to the distant reaches of the solar system with astounding precision.
This month, Dr. Gregory R. Buck of Saint Anselm College, in Manchester, N.H., disclosed a new class of approximate N-body solutions based on the analogy of a closed loop of beads, in which the beads, evenly spaced, chase each other around the curves and tangles of the loop. The system may help to work out the interactions of particles within a plasma, Dr. Buck suggested.
But none of the approximations now known exactly solve Newton's equations, and this means that the motions of asteroids and comets can be predicted only up to a certain point in the distant future. Beyond that, forecasting an impact by one of these objects on the earth may be intrinsically impossible. A hit or miss may depend so sensitively on the minuscule ''initial conditions'' of all the objects involved that precise calculation becomes impossible. This is a property of a large class of systems scientists describe as chaotic.
Long-term foreknowledge of the hit or miss -- a question of life or death for millions -- is ruled out by the chaos inherent in the N-body system.
Scientists have yet to come to terms with chaos in all its manifestations. Dr. Steven Weinberg, winner of a Nobel prize in physics, once said he considered an understanding of chaotic turbulence in fluids as the single most intractable problem in physics. Until scientists reach a deeper understanding of turbulence, many physicists believe, the dynamics of climate change, the behavior of galaxies and many other phenomena can never be fully penetrated.
Chaos can also prevent reliable predictions of group decisions, including those that investors make. Group decisions by investors can cause chaotic price fluctuations of commodities that are intrinsically unpredictable, it seems.
In a report published Aug. 24 in the journal Physical Review Letters, Dr. David A. Meyer of the University of California at San Diego and Dr. Thad A. Brown of the University of Missouri presented formal proof that collective decisions can be chaotic, even when the views of all participants are known and a standard voting rule is strictly applied.
When a group of decision-makers must choose between three or more options by comparing two of them at a time, the collective outcome often depends on the order in which the choices are presented. The outcome can cycle chaotically, the mathematicians found. Even nonhuman decision-makers -- the computers that buy and sell commodities according to programmed rules, for example -- are subject to chaotic uncertainty, a situation in which prediction becomes impossible.
Frustrated by the complex and chaotic behavior of the real world, some theorists have invented forecasting techniques based on little more than pure mathematics.
In the 1970's, Rene Thom, a French mathematician, developed an approach called Catastrophe Theory, which, for a time, enjoyed a considerable vogue among physicists, biologists and even sociologists. The theory is an application of topology, a field of mathematics that deals with the shapes of surfaces.
Dr. Thom's theory holds that many sequences of events can be represented as smooth trajectories along a saddle-shaped surface, at one point of which an abrupt discontinuity, or ''catastrophe cusp,'' shunts them off to one side of the saddle or the other.
Dr. Thom and his followers proposed that mathematical models based on catastrophe cusps could be used to predict the reproduction of bacteria, the behavior of the stock market, heart attacks, biological evolution and the outbreak of war, among many other things. To some, Dr. Thom's theory seemed to offer an explanation of almost everything, but many others condemned it as useless. Today, Catastrophe Theory is all but forgotten.
Predicting life spans in the absence of detailed knowledge has long interested scientists as well as insurance statisticians. A forecast of life expectancy based on the average age at death of a person's four grandparents is a simple example of statistical forecasting. But a much more daring approach was devised a few years ago by Dr. J. Richard Gott 3d, a professor of astrophysics at Princeton University.
Dr. Gott's scheme is based on the ''Copernican principle,'' which assumes that the odds are overwhelmingly against any particular place or time being ''special.'' From this, Dr. Gott reasoned that the mere knowledge of how long something (or someone) has been around is sufficient to estimate how much longer it could last. Based on this system, and the assumption that Homo sapiens appeared on earth about 200,000 years ago, Dr. Gott calculated that intelligent human beings are 95-percent certain to survive a minimum of 5,128 years more, and a maximum of 7.8 million years more.
There are those who contend that predictions like these are so vague that they are scarcely more useful than the prophecies of the Delphic oracle in ancient Greece, which was consulted by Socrates, Oedipus and other luminaries of the day. The oracle (operated by a concealed priest or priestess) was so ambiguous it could nearly never be proved wrong.
Scientists will never be able to answer all our questions about future events or to satisfy a deep-seated human yearning to foresee what's coming at us. Some scientific efforts at prediction will always be defeated by the nature of Nature.
Mystic oracles have never shed light on future events either, but even 1,398 years after Socrates' suicide, legions of people continue to visit palmists, astrologists and psychics. It's human to prefer something to nothing at all.

Full text: THE TIME has come for renewable energy sources.
In light of recent media reports that the Earth's oil reserves are dwindling, which will lead to drastic increases in oil prices, predicted to hit around the year 2005, we must consider the options available to a country like New Zealand that doesn't have sufficient oil supplies of its own.
On a global level, displacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources is one solution that has been suggested to reduce the rate of climate change.
This was advocated at Kyoto, Japan, at the Climate Change conference in Decem ber 1997.
Other countries around the world are reading the signs and are investing in renewable energy supplies.
The Europeans aim to increase their supply of energy from these sources from 6 to 12 percent. In the United States, President Bill Clinton's science advisers have recommended huge increases in research funding into alternative energy. In Australia, the Government has advocated a 2 percent compulsory purchase by electricity retailers from Green Power generators.
The global insurance industry is also concerned at the increasing claims resulting from extreme weather events in recent years, such as drought, cyclones and floods, possibly a result of climate change caused by the consumption of these fossil fuels and the greenhouse gases they create.
It is also encouraging that international oil companies such as Shell and BP are diversifying into alternative energy sources by investing large sums in energy companies using sources of renewables, paving the way for future business.
But in New Zealand there has been a "disconnection" between recent energy-related policy decisions and our international obligations on greenhouse gas emissions and controls.
Cheaper car imports, resulting in more vehicle use and increased carbon dioxide emissions and a drastic cut in funding to the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, are just two examples of New Zealand's backward stance.
Electricity reforms are also a backward step. Cheaper wholesale electricity prices in the short term, from increased competition, mean alternative sources of renewable energy may not be able to compete with gas and coal, until such time as the costs on society for emitting greenhouse gases are also included.
Oil and gas exploration is being encouraged and recent successes may replace the dwindling Maui reserves; Huntly may re convert from gas to coal; and the threatened carbon tax to industry is no longer on the Government's agenda.
Research funding in the energy sector continues to be dominated by the fossil fuel dinosaurs to the detriment of the sustainable energy mammals.
So, what is the answer? One controversial option could be just to continue to burn fossil fuels and plant more trees to absorb the CO2 until New Zealand is just one big forest again. Or better still, undergo a slow and painless transition from dependence on fossil fuels to more renewables while also encouraging energy efficiency. But to succeed we have to start now -- not put it off until 10 or 20 years' time.

Abstract: At a United Nations meeting of more than 200 financiers, the Environment Minister, Michael Meacher, presented figures showing that an index of stocks of firms, chosen for their environmental and social responsibility, had consistently outstripped the FTSE All- Share Index during the long bull market, and done twice as well since prices began to fall precipitously this summer. About pounds 2bn is invested in ethical and environmental funds in Britain - more than twice as much as in the rest of Europe. The NPI Social Index, compiled by the City firm, NPI Asset Management, measures the performance of the 150 British firms "assessed as being the most effective in managing their environmental and social impact". To join it, companies must have a good record, stretching from products offering environmental benefits, to charity donations and profit-sharing for employees. Household names in the index include Boots, BT, Iceland, Sainsbury, NatWest and General Accident.

Full text: "GREEN-CHIP" ethical investments are far outperforming other stocks and shares, even in the stock-market slump, according to latest figures.
At a United Nations meeting of more than 200 financiers, the Environment Minister, Michael Meacher, presented figures showing that an index of stocks of firms, chosen for their environmental and social responsibility, had consistently outstripped the FTSE All- Share Index during the long bull market, and done twice as well since prices began to fall precipitously this summer.
Similar measurements for Asia and the Pacific - where the crash has hit hard - show that ethical stocks actually increased in value over the past six weeks, while shares as a whole fell by nearly 10 per cent.
This startling evidence that virtue need not be its own reward was one example of self-interest pulling in the same direction as the interests of the planet, discussed at a conference on "Profitability and Responsibility in the 21st Century" held last week at Queen's College, Cambridge.
The meeting, organised by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), heard of big business opportunities in fighting pollution, discounted loans and "green" mortgages - and how global warming could threaten banks' and insurance firms' survival.
About pounds 2bn is invested in ethical and environmental funds in Britain - more than twice as much as in the rest of Europe. The NPI Social Index, compiled by the City firm, NPI Asset Management, measures the performance of the 150 British firms "assessed as being the most effective in managing their environmental and social impact". To join it, companies must have a good record, stretching from products offering environmental benefits, to charity donations and profit-sharing for employees. Household names in the index include Boots, BT, Iceland, Sainsbury, NatWest and General Accident.
The figures show that cumulative returns from the Social Index companies have risen by more than three-and-a-half times this decade, bettering a threefold increase by the FTSE All-Share Index, and doing better on almost all measures of share prices and dividends. And since 1 July this year, the price of its shares has dropped by only 5 per cent - less than half of the 11.05 per cent fall in shares as a whole.
Mr Meacher told the conference: "Too often, financial managers see ... ethical investment as a niche market. But perhaps these ethical investors have something to teach the broader investment industry." A good record on the environment was increasingly viewed by analysts as a sign of a well-managed company. "Fund managers are looking for efficient environmental management. 'Green chips' are as significant as blue chips."
There were massive opportunities for investment and profit in a fast- rising market for green products that was already worth about pounds 280bn a year worldwide. There was also a lot to lose through pollution and climate change.
By last week, 115 banks and other financial institutions, and 78 insurance companies worldwide had signed a UNEP init-iative, promising to incorporate environmental concerns into every aspect of their businesses.

`Crisis' in oceans may pose threat to human survival - commission report: [CITY EDITION]

Abstract: The land pollutes the sea. Not a startling revelation, you might think, but it is one of the many detailed facts in the first report by the Independent World Commission on the Oceans which was published at Expo '98 in Lisbon, Portugal, last week. Published by the commission to mark the International Year of the Ocean, the report warns of an "unfolding drama" on the high seas, extending from territorial disputes which threaten peace and security and the effects of global climate change to over-fishing, habitat destruction, illegal trafficking, congested shipping lanes, piracy, terrorism and the disruption of coastal communities. The commission, which was formed under UN auspices in 1995, says it is no exaggeration to refer to a "crisis" in the oceans which may pose a threat to human survival. After all, in the words of the late Jacques Cousteau, "if the sea dies, man dies". The report presents much evidence to back up its case, including statistics on pollution levels, with both land and atmospheric sources of same; the growth of piracy and maritime violence, particularly in south-east Asia; detrimental effects of mineral exploitation and certain modern fishing practices; and the impact of El Nino.

Full text: The land pollutes the sea. Not a startling revelation, you might think, but it is one of the many detailed facts in the first report by the Independent World Commission on the Oceans which was published at Expo '98 in Lisbon, Portugal, last week.
In fact, land-based sources account for some 77 per cent of marine pollution levels, according to the report which calls for a new global approach to ocean management and recommends that the issue of ocean affairs be integrated into all relevant UN bodies and agencies.
Published by the commission to mark the International Year of the Ocean, the report warns of an "unfolding drama" on the high seas, extending from territorial disputes which threaten peace and security and the effects of global climate change to over-fishing, habitat destruction, illegal trafficking, congested shipping lanes, piracy, terrorism and the disruption of coastal communities.
The commission, which was formed under UN auspices in 1995, says it is no exaggeration to refer to a "crisis" in the oceans which may pose a threat to human survival. After all, in the words of the late Jacques Cousteau, "if the sea dies, man dies". The report presents much evidence to back up its case, including statistics on pollution levels, with both land and atmospheric sources of same; the growth of piracy and maritime violence, particularly in south-east Asia; detrimental effects of mineral exploitation and certain modern fishing practices; and the impact of El Nino.
In relation to climate change, one of the most disturbing facts was gleaned during an analysis of whale catches since 1930 near the Antarctic ice edge. This has shown that the circumpolar ice edge retreated several degrees of latitude between 1954 and 1972, corresponding to a dramatic 25 per cent reduction in the area of ice cover, which probably has significant consequences for the biological productivity of the Southern Ocean. This major regional climatic change may signal a global one, it says.
The commission says it is unable to gauge to what extent climate change will be accompanied by an increase in the frequency and severity of storms or hurricanes - information which is critical to coastal engineering design and to the assessment of risk by the insurance industry. It believes oceans must be monitored to improve the ability to detect and predict the effects of climate change and the oceans' role as a "carbon dioxide sink".
It makes several recommendations aimed at allowing less developed coastal states like Ireland to build the capacity to take effective advantage - in a sustainable manner - of exclusive rights to use of resources in their areas, and to meet their obligations under the UN Law of the Sea Convention. However, high seas should be treated as a public trust, it stresses. Emphasising the need for a political will, it proposes that navies be deployed to the non-military task of protecting the marine environment. The maintenance of the freedom of the seas must be balanced against the claims of coastal states, it says.
"Efforts to reorientate naval responsibilities should include the creation and training of specialised naval units, mandated and equipped to undertake policing tasks supported, wherever possible, by the use of ocean observation satellites. Where navies are reluctant to depart from tradition, the capability of national coastguards and other security forces could be appropriately strengthened," it says.

Abstract: In 1996, a late rapprochement between President Clinton and congressional Republicans brought compromise on welfare and immigration reform, health insurance transferability for workers changing jobs and a minimum wage increase. That cast an aura of success over what had been a contentious Congress. It also helped the president and the House and Senate majorities to re-election. No such scenario seems likely this fall. President Clinton's wounded condition has Democrats on the defensive. House and Senate leaders feel emboldened to insist on their own priorities. That means showdowns could occur on a broad range of issues, including some that have not figured prominently in the campaign to date. Guns: The Brady law's five-day waiting period for handgun purchases, an achievement of Clinton's first term, expires in November. Democrats have proposed an extension, but the restrictions are unpopular with gunowners' rights advocates, who are influential with the majority Republicans in Congress. The issue gives both parties a chance to charge up hardcore supporters.

Full text:   POLITICS: ISSUES FOR THE FALL CAMPAIGN; Election '98
In 1996, a late rapprochement between President Clinton and congressional Republicans brought compromise on welfare and immigration reform, health insurance transferability for workers changing jobs and a minimum wage increase. That cast an aura of success over what had been a contentious Congress. It also helped the president and the House and Senate majorities to re-election.
No such scenario seems likely this fall. President Clinton's wounded condition has Democrats on the defensive. House and Senate leaders feel emboldened to insist on their own priorities. That means showdowns could occur on a broad range of issues, including some that have not figured prominently in the campaign to date.
Guns: The Brady law's five-day waiting period for handgun purchases, an achievement of Clinton's first term, expires in November. Democrats have proposed an extension, but the restrictions are unpopular with gunowners' rights advocates, who are influential with the majority Republicans in Congress. The issue gives both parties a chance to charge up hardcore supporters.
Farms: Farm state members have taken to the floor this summer to remind colleagues that agriculture has not shared in the nation's general prosperity of late. Amendments attached to the agriculture appropriations bill would give farmers emergency relief from the devastating consequences of drought, other bad weather caused by El Nino and plummeting commodity prices caused by topsy-turvy currency conditions in Asia. Without that emergency aid, incumbents from these states would be in jeopardy.
Trade: Congress defeated renewal of Clinton's "fast-track" trading authority in 1997. Fast-track allows the president to negotiate trade treaties for Congress to approve or disapprove without amendment. The bipartisan coalition that prevailed last year seems intact, and not many voters are clamoring for new trade agreements, especially given the rising tide of imports from Asia.
Minimum wage: Senate Democrats are pushing a vote to increase minimum wage. Although this issue brought the parties together in 1996, Republican leaders have never supported it in principle and see no special political pressure to relent on the issue now.
Gays: Clinton's effort to admit gays in the military was a potent issue when Republicans seized their first majority of Southern House seats in 1994. But this year, when an effort was made to rescind Clinton's executive order on gays in the federal civilian workforce, a substantial number of Republicans sided with most Democrats in rejecting it. Some candidates still will raise the issue of either "gay rights" or "the homosexual agenda," but usually not in competitive districts.
Juvenile crime: Crime bills were once a staple of election-year legislative agendas. But this year, with crime rates down, the major crime legislation focused on juvenile programs and penalties. Efforts to tie in school violence have not raised the bill to national prominence, however. A House-passed bill is pending in the Senate, where it's certain to face filibuster.
Environment: Democrats are eager to address climate change and global warming concerns, but Republicans question the reliability of the underpinning theories. Democrats also are seeking ways to make use of voter anxiety about overdevelopment and urban sprawl, while Republicans press the rights of property owners against government regulation.

Abstract: Jacques Blondeau, the chairman and chief executive of French reinsurer SCOR, is a strong believer in catastrophe bonds. Says Mr Blondeau: "For a normal reinsurer to build up a huge fund of capital waiting for the big one does not make sense from an economic or financial perspective, since it would depress the return on equity. I think for this sort of activity, the capital markets will take over." The reluctance of reinsurers to carry peak risks is one of the main forces driving the development of the market for alternative forms of catastrophe finance. From the perspective of the worldwide insurance and reinsurance industry, there is an awareness of the imbalance between the supply of capital that can be raised and serviced and the potential exposure for catastrophe losses in the developed world alone, without even taking into account future demand from developing countries. The Catastrophe Price Index calculated by Paragon Reinsurance Risk Management Services Inc calculates relative US property/catastrophe prices from a sample of approximately 300 companies representing almost 1,000 treaties, and approximately 42 per cent of estimated industry premium. It started at 1.00 on January 1 in 1984 and fell to 0.93 by January 1 1989. Rates were already moving upwards when Hurricane Andrew occurred in September 1992. The index rose 60.2 per cent on the January 1 1993 renewals and peaked two years later at 2.47 following the Northridge earthquake. It has fallen steadily since and was down to 1.67 for renewals from January 1 1998.

Capital markets set to take on bigger role
New forms of catastrophe finance are being used to spread risks
Jacques Blondeau, the chairman and chief executive of French reinsurer SCOR, is a strong believer in catastrophe bonds. Says Mr Blondeau: "For a normal reinsurer to build up a huge fund of capital waiting for the big one does not make sense from an economic or financial perspective, since it would depress the return on equity. I think for this sort of activity, the capital markets will take over."
The reluctance of reinsurers to carry peak risks is one of the main forces driving the development of the market for alternative forms of catastrophe finance. From the perspective of the worldwide insurance and reinsurance industry, there is an awareness of the imbalance between the supply of capital that can be raised and serviced and the potential exposure for catastrophe losses in the developed world alone, without even taking into account future demand from developing countries.
Favouring stronger capital market involvement is a demand for highly rated investments as the issue of sovereign debt from industrial countries declines and as a way of securing better performance than can be obtained from low-yielding government bonds. Catastrophe bond issues, such as the 1998 bond for Texas-based USAA, are still being priced at more than 400 basis points over three-month Libor.
Normally, after a large catastrophe, rates rise. Reinsurers can raise more capital to take advantage of the higher rates. Prices soon begin to flatten, however, as a function of increased supply of capital. The problem, as the Bermuda property/catastrophe companies have found even in a zero tax environment, is not raising the capital but servicing it when the rates slide down.
The Catastrophe Price Index calculated by Paragon Reinsurance Risk Management Services Inc calculates relative US property/catastrophe prices from a sample of approximately 300 companies representing almost 1,000 treaties, and approximately 42 per cent of estimated industry premium. It started at 1.00 on January 1 in 1984 and fell to 0.93 by January 1 1989. Rates were already moving upwards when Hurricane Andrew occurred in September 1992. The index rose 60.2 per cent on the January 1 1993 renewals and peaked two years later at 2.47 following the Northridge earthquake. It has fallen steadily since and was down to 1.67 for renewals from January 1 1998.
Two points emerge. Although these three catastrophes alone resulted in insured losses of around $34.4bn, according to Swiss Re's Sigma report , competition began pushing rates down from January 1 1994. At the same time rates remain materially above pre-Andrew levels, which suggests that reinsurers are comparatively conservative about the amount of capital they are prepared to commit to US catastrophe risks.
The demand for securitised catastrophe protection could be extensive because without even considering the potential loss from a Tokyo earthquake or a wind storm striking the length the US Atlantic coast, there is already a substantial gap between insured and economic loss in catastrophes.
Munich Re estimates that in 1996 and 1997 insured losses were only 15 per cent of the total. Insurance density is the key. Insurance density and insured values are very high in the US. The Kobe earthquake in Japan in January 1995 killed about 6,000 people and resulted in insured losses of $2.6bn, in 1996 price terms, but Munich Re estimates uninsured economic losses at about $97bn.
The growing world population and intensifying urbanisation do not just lead to an increase in insured exposures but can actually change the nature of risk. Urban centres are attractive targets for terrorists because of the impact they can have. The combination of populations under pressure in cities with valuable property is a volatile one; race riots in Los Angeles in 1992 figure among the 40 mostly costly loss events since 1970. The increased heat and exhaust gases associated with urbanisation and geological changes resulting from large building works can also affect risk. As Munich Re points out: "Big cities create their own climate, a problem that will be intensified by global climate change."
It also points out that more than 15 per cent of all insurance payments were for insurance of the person - life, health and personal accident. In terms of fatalities, the greatest deaths occurred in earthquakes and cyclones, but the list also includes three man-made disasters in India: a dam-burst in 1979 when 15,000 people died; the Bhopal chemical plant malfunction which resulted in 3,000 deaths and much disability which was not recorded; and a railway accident at Bihar in 1981 when about 2,500 people died.

Beware of `experts' with one bright idea: [Final Edition]

Author: Riley, Susan

Abstract: Indeed, Carl Sonnen of Informetrica, Ottawa-based economic consultants, believes ongoing cuts to education and health spending are contributing to the decline in productivity, not reversing it. His is a credible, if rarely heard, challenge to current orthodoxy. As Sonnen says, a productive workforce tends to be "well-educated and healthy." In underfunding social programs, the government may be blunting our competitive edge. Such complexities are lost amid the alarmist headlines, dire warnings and daily predictions of disaster. Never mind that stock markets, by their nature, rise and fall, or that the loonie's latest decline is an extension of a 15-year slide; caveats like these can ruin a good panic. And a panic, abetted by an always-eager media, provides a perfect opportunity for religious fanatics of all stripes to advance their own brand of salvation. Lately, it has been tax cuts. Pollster Frank Graves of Ekos Research says repeated soundings show Canadians think taxes are too high, but rank tax cuts below other priorities, like shoring up medicare and retiring the debt. For his part, Graves doesn't object to tax relief, but he rightly accuses its most ardent advocates of being "disingenuous" and "self- interested" when advancing broad-based cuts as an economic cure- all. "I'm surprised," he says, "they weren't suggested as a solution to climate change or El Nino."

Full text: All of a sudden, everything has come undone for Finance Minister Paul Martin (if not for the rest of us.) Stock markets are slumping, the loonie has reached historic lows, interest rates have gone up, growth is slowing and talk of global recession has dampened this spring's cheery predictions of yearly federal surpluses.
So far, Martin has responded with reassurances and a promise. In what has become a mantra, he insists that "the fundamentals are right" - that our declining dollar is the victim of nervous speculators spooked by the Asian crisis, and not a judgment on Canada's economic health. And he promises more funding for health, along with tax cuts for middle-class Canadians, in his February budget.
But are the fundamentals right? Not all economists think so; indeed, they point to evidence that productivity - the efficiency with which we produce and export goods - has fallen in the last five years as sporadic layoffs and downsizing continue. The right blames this on spoiled or undermotivated Canadian workers, allegedly coddled by free medicare and unemployment benefits that are still too rich. This powerful chorus calls for more cuts in government spending, more privatization, an end to minimum wage laws and other "labour market rigidities" designed to shelter people from abject misery.
There is another school, less popular with newspaper editorial boards, that argues that poor productivity is as much the result of uninspired management, bad investments and lack of funding for research as the fault of a malingering workforce. Another problem, some say, is a low dollar that makes our exports automatically attractive and removes incentives to Canadian industry to modernize.
Indeed, Carl Sonnen of Informetrica, Ottawa-based economic consultants, believes ongoing cuts to education and health spending are contributing to the decline in productivity, not reversing it. His is a credible, if rarely heard, challenge to current orthodoxy. As Sonnen says, a productive workforce tends to be "well-educated and healthy." In underfunding social programs, the government may be blunting our competitive edge.
But such complexities are lost amid the alarmist headlines, dire warnings and daily predictions of disaster. Never mind that stock markets, by their nature, rise and fall, or that the loonie's latest decline is an extension of a 15-year slide; caveats like these can ruin a good panic. And a panic, abetted by an always-eager media, provides a perfect opportunity for religious fanatics of all stripes to advance their own brand of salvation. Lately, it has been tax cuts.
The drumbeat started some years ago in the financial press, within the Reform Party caucus and in other redoubts of the right, and has now reached the finance minister's office. So eager is Martin to reward long-suffering Canadians with a tax break this winter that he is apparently ready to appropriate the Employment Insurance fund, with its tempting $6-billion surplus - enough, Martin hopes, to offset an expected $4-billion shortfall in anticipated federal revenues.
But will tax cuts stimulate a floundering economy, avert a recession and compensate for interest rate increases, as its champions suggest? That depends on how large the tax cut is and how widely shared. Across-the-board cuts, which attract most attention - for an ambitious finance minister, a crucial consideration - are also the most costly. In fact, they are so costly that Martin won't likely be able to afford anything more than a token gesture - "enough to buy a radio, but not a car," in the words of ministerial adviser Bob Brown.
Why waste money on an ineffectual tax cut? Martin has a sophisticated grasp of economics and politics; if he proceeds with a general tax cut, it will be the politician speaking, although he may not be saying what people, outside of his highly-paid advisers, want to hear.
Pollster Frank Graves of Ekos Research says repeated soundings show Canadians think taxes are too high, but rank tax cuts below other priorities, like shoring up medicare and retiring the debt. For his part, Graves doesn't object to tax relief, but he rightly accuses its most ardent advocates of being "disingenuous" and "self- interested" when advancing broad-based cuts as an economic cure- all. "I'm surprised," he says, "they weren't suggested as a solution to climate change or El Nino."
In the end, several apparently contradictory things are true. The economic situation isn't as bad as it seems and it could get much worse. Beware of the "expert" with one bright idea. And remember: the fundamentals are right. Or are they?

Climate Change: As Gains on Equities Dissipate, So Does U.S. Economic Froth --- Party Atmosphere Darkens Despite a Rally; Jaguars And IPOs Are Affected --- A Test for Corporate Europe

Full text: What would a bear market be like?
U.S. share prices moved down again Wednesday, reminding investors of Monday's 6.4% drop and giving them a troubling hint of what it would mean to their lives and businesses if shares no longer were heading inexorably higher.
It was an experience new to many: The last 20% stock decline came nearly eight years ago, and the last grinding, relentless down market was 25 years back. With another long and deep decline in U.S. stocks no longer unimaginable, it is worth exploring some people's reactions to the recent chill winds.
Mark Schwartz's reaction, for instance. In last year's raging bull market, Mr. Schwartz felt so rich that he sold a $25,000 chunk of his portfolio of Israeli high-technology stocks to pay for his son's bar mitzvah.
What's left of that portfolio has since plunged. So when it came time for Mr. Schwartz to finally buy the "restored and pristine" Jaguar of his dreams, he just couldn't do it. The lawyer from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, figured he could make do with his 1988 Volvo. It wasn't just Mr. Schwartz's stocks that took a beating. So did his psyche.
And the beatings are likely to continue. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 45.06 points to 7782.37 in late trading Wednesday, deflating some of the optimism behind Tuesday's 288-point rally -- and leaving investors in U.S. stocks about $2 trillion poorer than they were last week. One result is that many people are already feeling less well off, and some are starting to pull back from the types of spending commonplace in the bull market's heyday.
And it isn't just individuals and Americans who are affected. The 1990s' rising stock prices paved the way for a record crop of entrepreneurial businesses to tap the public markets for capital, primarily through initial public offerings. In addition, some of the world's largest corporate mergers -- witness the $48 billion trans-Atlantic deal between British Petroleum PLC and Amoco Corp. -- have taken place in the past few years, compliments of high stock prices that made deals easier to do. In corporate compensation, steadily rising share prices have made stock options a valuable part of millions of American pay packages, not just for executives, but also for some lower-level employees.
The great bull market has also helped draw thousands of European investors into stocks for the first time; a protracted bear market in the U.S. would test the nerve of these newcomers as never before. It would also test European corporate executives, many of whom are now saying that the current market gyrations won't prompt them to scale back their investment plans (see "Many European Concerns Aren't Rattled by Markets" -- WSJE Sept. 3,1998).
While it is hard to say how profoundly a bear market would affect corporate practices -- so much would depend on how relentless the bear was -- it is notable that American IPOs have already been slammed, while some European IPOs have been postponed. An IPO well that stayed dry for a long time could, unbeknownst to the world, lead to the death of any number of innovative little companies that years from now might otherwise have become major players. The venture-capital seed money that funds those kinds of start-ups also would likely dry up.
All this threatens to weaken the "entrepreneurial spirit" that has flourished in the 1990s, says Reena Aggarwal, associate professor of finance at Georgetown University. It would be particularly problematic for potential start-ups because, Ms. Aggarwal says, no other country in the world has any substantive new-issue market for young companies: "The U.S. is the only country where a Netscape and Yahoo! can go public."
Just one new issue came to market in the U.S. last week, down from 19 only four weeks ago. Other IPOs have been postponed or canceled. One casualty is Galacticomm Technologies Inc., a Florida-based software company that was slated to price an $11 million IPO Tuesday and begin trading Wednesday. Galacticomm plans to try for its IPO in a couple of weeks, provided the market stabilizes. If not, "you have to temper your ambitions," says Peter Berg, chief executive, and try tapping private sources of capital instead.
Similar casualties are cropping up across Europe. In Sweden, for example, the Stockholm Stock Exchange last year saw 54 IPOs and other share releases. This year, exchange officials are expecting a maximum of 40 -- or, if the current market volatility continues, as few as 30. In recent weeks, some five companies have put their plans to release shares on hold until the market quiets down, exchange officials say.
In the years since Americans last lived through a prolonged bear market -- 1973 and much of 1974 -- the world has become a very different place. For one thing, it is more sensitive to stock-market swings. In the mid-1970s, Silicon Valley was in its infancy, and many of its fabulous growth stocks didn't yet exist. Powerhouse companies that today drive an economy centered on technology -- behemoths such as Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Dell Computer -- hadn't been founded. It was nearly unimaginable that a young company could hire an earring-wearing engineer with a fat package of options, then see him jump off to found his own company and take it public in the stock market.
American retirement accounts those days tended to be run by faceless pension-fund executives with an attachment to bonds and predictable returns. Today, individuals often manage their own retirement accounts, shifting them into and out of a dizzying array of mutual funds. Indeed, individuals never have been more vulnerable to a stock downturn. Fueled by the bull market, households' net worth -- their financial and real assets less liabilities -- earlier this year hit a record six times their disposable personal income.
Many investors remain flush, of course, after nearly eight years of market gains. The full impact on the spending and other behavior of individuals and corporations tends to lag behind the market action. And, of course, the market correction could be over; stocks could continue Tuesday and Wednesday's broad rebound and earn back the losses. Indeed, optimism about a recovery led Gregory Hinckley, chief operating officer of Oregon-based Mentor Graphics Corp., to buy 5,000 more shares of his company's slumping stock to add to the 25,000 shares he already owned. "I'm a contrarian by nature," he says.
Yet many people suddenly "don't feel as wealthy as they did, and are less likely to splurge," says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc., the credit-rating company. "Spending on bigticket items" will suffer, Mr. Lonski predicts. "What you're going to find is that consumer confidence will be much more sensitive" to a market swoon.
About a quarter of U.S. consumer spending is "due to the wealth from the stock market," estimates Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Minneapolis banking group Norwest Corp. "A correction or bear market, which is what I think we are seeing, will have a significant impact on consumer spending," he says, "and therefore on all the companies selling to consumers. And two-thirds of the economy is driven by consumer spending." An America that consumes less also imports less, a troubling thought considering that the U.S. has long been the world's consumer of last resort.
Credit Suisse First Boston Corp., which had losses in Russia and other emerging markets, has told recruiters it won't be doing any more hiring for its bond, investment-banking and derivatives departments this year. A spokesman says those divisions at the firm, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, had already "met their head count" although "exceptions" are permitted. "This is routine business practice this time of year," he says.
Meanwhile, some analysts say a worsening market slump would threaten the long-anticipated November IPO of Wall Street giant Goldman, Sachs & Co. Goldman says its "plans remain unchanged."
If the stock market gives the nation a chill, New York City could face a frost. The largest U.S. city has become more dependent than ever on Wall Street in the past five years. Wall Street bonuses hit $12 billion last year, bringing budget surpluses to government, according to a report by state Comptroller Carl McCall. Securities firms incurring emerging-market trading losses are likely to cut bonuses and perhaps lay people off, surely affecting the region's financial health.
From his front-row view of the market's drama of recent weeks, Mark Greenstein had seen enough by the end of last week to lose his appetite for a bigger condo and a new car. A broker at a small Wall Street firm, Mr. Greenstein was in the midst of selling a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan for $255,000, with his sights set on a two-bedroom priced at about $350,000.
He says he also had his eye on a new Mercedes to replace the 1983 Cadillac Coupe de Ville he inherited from his father. He has scrapped those plans, at least for now, because he thinks trouble in stocks could portend a weaker real-estate market down the road. "I'll just keep the old Caddy running," he says, and take the ribbing from his colleagues.
Corcoran Group, a real-estate brokerage firm in New York, has held workshops to coach brokers on "how to reassure your buyer." Among the tips: Remind them that "unlike most stock portfolios, a home is a long-term investment." Though they needed more hand-holding, most prospective buyers went ahead with their purchases -- until last weekend, says the firm's president, Barbara Corcoran. She says buyers started pulling out of deals, citing fears about the direction of stocks.
Silicon Valley, where scores of high-tech start-ups have enriched employees with lucrative stock options, also faces some cracks. Already, some tech companies have begun repricing options, which allow holders to buy shares at a set price. With the steep stock-price plunges, some of those options have become essentially worthless. Companies such as Quickturn Design Systems Inc. in San Jose, California, have "reloaded" them at lower prices, partly to keep employees from bolting. The company's "most valuable talent" was being wooed by rivals, and it needed to reprice the options to keep those employees "focused and content," says Raymond Ostby, chief financial officer.
Some area restaurants have felt a chill. Steve Koidal, general manager of Left At Albuquerque in Palo Alto, California, finds people still are drinking his margaritas and eating his salmon and fajitas. But business, instead of growing steadily as in the past, has become choppy. The restaurant will do record business one day, "and then some other days have been extremely slow for no apparent reason," he says.
Many tech stocks trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market have been in a slump since April. And even as overall California home sales rose 8.1% in July from June, sales in Silicon Valley slid 7.3%, according to G.U. Krueger, deputy chief economist at the California Association of Realtors. Lee Blansett put his Palo Alto house on the market in early August, hoping to make a quick killing after seeing a two-year buying frenzy in the area. He thought he would sell in two weeks. It took four.
"What ended up happening was that instead of getting multiple bids as we expected -- six or seven has been typical in Palo Alto -- we only got one," says Mr. Blansett, a market researcher with a Palo Alto health-care consultancy. Agents had told him to expect $540,000 to $550,000; he sold for $515,000, and to get that figure, the agent gave up part of the commission.
"What we are seeing is that Silicon Valley is very much driven by IPOs and by Nasdaq," Mr. Blansett says. "Nasdaq has been down, so everyone's options have been underwater. And the slowdown of the IPO market means that you don't have so many people wandering around with $500,000 in cash in their pockets. So we've had a lot less liquidity in the market."
Even the toniest areas back on the American Eastern seaboard are feeling pain. William Benedetto, an investment banker, a month ago looked to sell his waterfront summer home in Long Island's Hamptons for more than $1 million. But as the market has fallen off, so has the number of visitors. Last Thursday, as the Dow Industrials plunged more than 350 points, a potential buyer from Wall Street canceled a visit because, Mr. Benedetto says, he "couldn't leave" his computer screen. "Waterfront premiums had been the highest in 20 years," Mr. Benedetto says. "Now the premium may be shrinking because of the market."
For some, the pinch has been both personal and professional. Michael Cohen, a stockbroker at Robert W. Baird & Co. in Florida, planned to soup up his Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which would have cost just $1,500 to $2,000. But with his clients pulling back, Mr. Cohen sat tight on the bike. "It's the little things I might have done otherwise," he says.
What Gary Goldstein, president of Whitney Group, an executive-recruiting firm, decided to put off was a kitchen renovation of his 1790 Colonial home in Bedford, New York. The shares of his firm's parent, Headway Corporate Resources Inc., have plunged to $5.625 from $12.75 on Nasdaq, and Mr. Goldstein has a "big chunk" of his net worth in the stock. "I've lived there 10 years; there's no reason I can't wait another six months" to do the kitchen, Mr. Goldstein says.
The potential impact on corporate America is harder to quantify, but it's clear that a battered stock price, from whatever cause, disrupts a company's investment, development and, sometimes, hiring plans. Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Lexington, Massachusetts, has faced such a battering, although it was due not so much to this weak market as to last year's withdrawal of Redux, the diet drug that Interneuron developed and American Home Products Corp. marketed. Having experienced a depressed stock price, Interneuron spokesman Bill Boni observes that "a general market downturn like this makes it difficult for small companies because it makes it difficult for investors to focus on the potential of individual products in your pipeline."
Meanwhile, the outlook has changed for some companies that have grown rapidly through acquisition, such as Conseco Inc. The financial-services and insurance company has taken over 20 companies since 1982. "We haven't been immune from this fallout," says Conseco Chairman Stephen Hilbert. "It also seems like anybody that's acquired anything has gotten killed as well."
Some acquisitive corporate executives see the decline as an opportunity. Mr. Hinckley, the Mentor Graphics COO, thinks the market upheaval will help his company's all-cash hostile takeover bid for rival Quickturn for $12.125 a share, which was recently rejected. With Quickturn at $9.8125 a share Monday on Nasdaq, Mr. Hinckley commented, "A few more days with the market going down 500 points, and it'll be looking more attractive." Quickturn, whose shares were trading at about the same price late Wednesday, declined to comment.
For some individuals, it is their company's stock that has hurt them most. Employees at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., who own 25% of the firm's 122 million shares outstanding, have had paper losses in the past several weeks totaling more than $1.38 billion, as their company stock -- which can make up much of their annual income -- has plunged by more than 50%. "My kids didn't have to go to college," joked William Ahearn, a Lehman spokesman, late Monday as Lehman's shares plunged 14%, or $6.3125, to $39.375, on the Big Board. By late Wednesday, the shares had clawed their way back to $43.1875.
Still, given the price at which people have been able to buy the stock, "everybody still has appreciation," Mr. Ahearn says.
At the end of a brutal Monday for the market and Lehman, Mr. Ahearn could still look on the bright side. He joked that he now would have to figure out how to pay for his recently completed vacation in West Virginia and added that with Lehman's annual stock-grant program nearing, "we'll get more shares at $45 than we would at $80."

Full text: What would a bear market be like?
Stocks came back smartly yesterday, but not before investors had gotten a troubling hint over the past few weeks of what it would mean to their lives and businesses if shares no longer were heading steadily, inexorably higher.
It was an experience new to many: The last 20% stock decline came nearly eight years ago, and the last grinding, relentless down market was 25 years back. With another long and deep decline in U.S. stocks no longer unimaginable, it is worth exploring some people's reactions to the recent chill winds.
Mark Schwartz's reaction, for instance. In last year's raging bull market, Mr. Schwartz felt so rich that he sold a $25,000 chunk of his portfolio of Israeli high-technology stocks to pay for his son's bar mitzvah.
What's left of that portfolio has since plunged. So when it came time for Mr. Schwartz to finally buy the "restored and pristine" Jaguar of his dreams, he just couldn't do it. The Bryn Mawr, Pa., lawyer figured he could make do with his 1988 Volvo, 135,000 miles and all. It wasn't just Mr. Schwartz's stocks that took a beating. So did his psyche.
Even yesterday's comeback still leaves investors as a whole about $2 trillion poorer. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks -- the kind many individual investors favor -- is off 29% since April. One result is that many people are already feeling less well off, and some are starting to pull back from the types of spending commonplace in the bull market's heyday.
And it isn't just individuals who are affected. The 1990s' rising stock prices paved the way for a record crop of entrepreneurial businesses to tap the public markets for capital, primarily through initial public stock offerings. In addition, some of the world's largest corporate mergers have taken place in the past few years, compliments of high stock prices that made deals easier to do. Finally, in corporate compensation, steadily rising share prices have made stock options a valuable part of millions of pay packages, not just for executives, but also for some lower-level employees.
While it is hard to say how profoundly a bear market would affect these corporate practices -- so much would depend on how relentless the bear was -- it is notable that initial offerings have already been slammed. An IPO well that stayed dry for a long time could, unbeknownst to the world, lead to the death of any number of innovative little companies that years from now might otherwise have become major players. The venture-capital seed money that funds those kinds of start-ups also would likely dry up.
All this could weaken the "entrepreneurial spirit" that has flourished in the 1990s, says Reena Aggarwal, associate professor of finance at Georgetown University. It would be particularly problematic for potential start-ups because, Ms. Aggarwal says, no other country in the world has any substantive new-issue market for young companies: "The U.S. is the only country where a Netscape and Yahoo! can go public."
Just one new issue came to market last week, down from 19 only four weeks ago. Other IPOs have been postponed or canceled. One casualty is Galacticomm Technologies Inc., a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., software company, which was slated to price an $11 million IPO yesterday and begin trading today. Galacticomm plans to try for its IPO in a couple of weeks, provided the market stabilizes. If not, "you have to temper your ambitions," says Peter Berg, chief executive, and try tapping private sources of capital instead.
In the years since Americans last lived through a prolonged bear market -- 1973 and much of 1974 -- the world has become a very different place. For one thing, it is more sensitive to stock-market swings. In the mid-1970s, Silicon Valley was in its infancy, and many of its fabulous growth stocks didn't yet exist. Powerhouse companies that today drive an economy centered on technology -- behemoths such as Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Dell Computer -- hadn't been founded. It was nearly unimaginable that a young company could hire an earring-wearing engineer with a fat package of options, then see him jump off to found his own company and take it public in the stock market.
Retirement accounts those days tended to be run by faceless pension-fund executives with an attachment to bonds and predictable returns. Today, individuals often manage their own retirement accounts, shifting them into and out of a dizzying array of mutual funds. Indeed, individuals never have been more vulnerable to a stock downturn. Fueled by the bull market, households' net worth -- their financial and real assets less liabilities -- earlier this year hit a record six times their disposable personal income.
Many investors remain flush, of course, after nearly eight years of market gains. The full impact on the spending and other behavior of individuals and corporations tends to lag behind the market action. And, of course, the market correction could be over; stocks could continue yesterday's broad rebound and earn back the losses. Indeed, optimism about a recovery led Gregory Hinckley, chief operating officer of Mentor Graphics Corp., Wilsonville, Ore., to buy 5,000 more shares of his company's slumping stock to add to the 25,000 shares he already owned. "I'm a contrarian by nature," he says.
Yet many people suddenly "don't feel as wealthy as they did, and are less likely to splurge," says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc., the credit-rating company. "Spending on big-ticket items" will suffer, Mr. Lonski predicts. "What you're going to find is that consumer confidence will be much more sensitive" to a market swoon.
About a quarter of consumer spending is "due to the wealth from the stock market," estimates Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Minneapolis banking group Norwest Corp. "A correction or bear market, which is what I think we are seeing, will have a significant impact on consumer spending," he says, "and therefore on all the companies selling to consumers. And two-thirds of the economy is driven by consumer spending."
Credit Suisse First Boston Corp., which had losses in Russia and other emerging markets, has told recruiters it won't be doing any more hiring for its bond, investment-banking and derivatives departments this year. A spokesman says those divisions at the firm, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, had already "met their head count" although "exceptions" are permitted. "This is routine business practice this time of year," he says.
Meanwhile, some analysts say a worsening market slump would threaten the long-anticipated November IPO of Wall Street giant Goldman, Sachs & Co. Goldman says its "plans remain unchanged."
If the stock market gives the nation a chill, New York City could face a frost. The largest U.S. city has become more dependent than ever on Wall Street in the past five years. Wall Street bonuses hit $12 billion last year, bringing budget surpluses to government, according to a report by state Comptroller Carl McCall. Securities firms incurring emerging-market trading losses are likely to cut bonuses and perhaps lay people off, surely affecting the region's financial health.
From his front-row view of the market's drama of recent weeks, Mark Greenstein had seen enough by the end of last week to lose his appetite for a bigger condo and a new car. A broker at a small Wall Street firm, Mr. Greenstein was in the midst of selling a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan for $255,000, with his sights set on a two-bedroom priced at about $350,000.
He says he also had his eye on a new Mercedes to replace the 1983 Cadillac Coupe de Ville he inherited from his father. He has scrapped those plans, at least for now, because he thinks trouble in stocks could portend a weaker real-estate market down the road. "I'll just keep the old Caddy running," he says, and take the ribbing from his colleagues.
Corcoran Group, a real-estate brokerage firm in New York, has held workshops to coach brokers on "how to reassure your buyer." Among the tips: Remind them that "unlike most stock portfolios, a home is a long-term investment." Though they needed more hand-holding, most prospective buyers went ahead with their purchases -- until last weekend, says the firm's president, Barbara Corcoran. She says buyers started pulling out of deals, citing fears about the direction of stocks.
Silicon Valley, where scores of hightech start-ups have enriched employees with lucrative stock options, also faces some cracks. Already, some tech companies have begun repricing options, which allow holders to buy shares at a set price. With the steep stock-price plunges, some of those options have become essentially worthless. Companies such as Quickturn Design Systems Inc. in San Jose, Calif., have "reloaded" them at lower prices, partly to keep employees from bolting. The company's "most valuable talent" was being wooed by rivals, and it needed to reprice the options to keep those employees "focused and content," says Raymond Ostby, chief financial officer.
Some area restaurants have felt a chill. Steve Koidal, general manager of Left At Albuquerque in Palo Alto, finds people still are drinking his margaritas and eating his salmon and fajitas. But business, instead of growing steadily as in the past, has become choppy. The restaurant will do record business one day, "and then some other days have been extremely slow for no apparent reason," he says.
Many tech stocks trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market have been in a slump since April. And even as overall California home sales rose 8.1% in July from June, sales in Silicon Valley slid 7.3%, according to G.U. Krueger, deputy chief economist at the California Association of Realtors.

Even the toniest areas back East are feeling pain. William Benedetto, an investment banker, a month ago looked to sell his waterfront summer home in Long Island's Hamptons for more than $1 million. But as the market has fallen off, so has the number of visitors. Last Thursday, as the Dow Industrials plunged more than 350 points, a potential buyer from Wall Street canceled a visit because, Mr. Benedetto says, he "couldn't leave" his computer screen. "Waterfront premiums had been the highest in 20 years," Mr. Benedetto says. "Now the premium may be shrinking because of the market."
The market downturn has affected Mr. Benedetto in other ways. When he offered to buy a car for his son, the third-year medical student asked for a BMW. Mr. Benedetto had another idea: a Saturn.
For some, the pinch has been personal and professional. Michael Cohen, a stockbroker at Robert W. Baird & Co. in Florida, planned to soup up his Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which would have cost just $1,500 to $2,000. But with his clients pulling back, Mr. Cohen sat tight on the bike. "It's the little things I might have done otherwise," he says.

Quickturn shares rebounded a bit yesterday to $9.875. The company declined to comment.
For some individuals, it is their company's stock that has hurt them most. Employees at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., who own 25% of the firm's 122 million shares outstanding, have had paper losses in the past several weeks totaling more than $1.38 billion, as their company stock -- which can make up much of their annual income -- has plunged by more than 50%. "My kids didn't have to go to college," quipped William Ahearn, a Lehman spokesman, late Monday as Lehman's shares plunged 14%, or $6.3125, to $39.375, on the Big Board. The shares rose 25 cents yesterday.
Still, given the price at which people have been able to buy the stock, "everybody still has appreciation," Mr. Ahearn says.

Are `the fundamentals' right, or the fundamentalists?: [Final Edition]

Author: Riley, Susan

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/are-fundamentals-right-fundamentalists/docview/240199347/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Are the fundamentals right? Not all economists think so; indeed, they point to evidence that productivity -- the efficiency with which we produce and export goods -- has fallen in the last five years as sporadic layoffs and downsizing continue. The right blames this on spoiled or undermotivated Canadian workers, allegedly coddled by free medicare and unemployment benefits that are still too rich. This powerful chorus calls for more cuts in government spending, more privatization, an end to minimum wage laws and other "labour market rigidities" designed to shelter people from abject misery. Indeed, Carl Sonnen of Informetrica, Ottawa-based economic consultants, believes ongoing cuts to education and health spending are contributing to the decline in productivity, not reversing it. His is a credible, if rarely-heard, challenge to current orthodoxy. As Sonnen says, a productive workforce tends to be "well-educated and healthy." In underfunding social programs, the government may be blunting our competitive edge. Pollster Frank Graves of Ekos Research says repeated soundings show Canadians think taxes are too high, but rank cuts below other priorities, like shoring up medicare and retiring the debt. For his part, Graves doesn't object to tax relief, but he rightly accuses its most ardent advocates of being "disingenuous" and "self- interested" when advancing broad-based cuts as an economic cure- all. "I'm surprised," he says, "they weren't suggested as a solution to climate change or El Nino."

Full text: The Citizen's Susan Riley writes here Wednesdays and Fridays.
All of a sudden, everything has come undone for Finance Minister Paul Martin (if not for the rest of us.) Stock markets are slumping, the loonie has reached historic lows, interest rates have gone up, growth is slowing and talk of global recession has dampened this spring's cheery predictions of yearly federal surpluses.
So far, Martin has responded with reassurances and a promise. In what has become a mantra, he insists that "the fundamentals are right" -- that our declining dollar is the victim of nervous speculators spooked by the Asian crisis, and not a judgement on Canada's economic health. And he promises more funding for health, along with tax cuts for middle-class Canadians, in his February budget.
But are the fundamentals right? Not all economists think so; indeed, they point to evidence that productivity -- the efficiency with which we produce and export goods -- has fallen in the last five years as sporadic layoffs and downsizing continue. The right blames this on spoiled or undermotivated Canadian workers, allegedly coddled by free medicare and unemployment benefits that are still too rich. This powerful chorus calls for more cuts in government spending, more privatization, an end to minimum wage laws and other "labour market rigidities" designed to shelter people from abject misery.
There is another school, less popular with newspaper editorial boards, which argues that poor productivity is as much the result of uninspired management, bad investments and lack of funding for research as the fault of a malingering workforce. Another problem, some say, is a low dollar that makes our exports automatically attractive and removes incentives to Canadian industry to modernize.
Indeed, Carl Sonnen of Informetrica, Ottawa-based economic consultants, believes ongoing cuts to education and health spending are contributing to the decline in productivity, not reversing it. His is a credible, if rarely-heard, challenge to current orthodoxy. As Sonnen says, a productive workforce tends to be "well-educated and healthy." In underfunding social programs, the government may be blunting our competitive edge.
But such complexities are lost amid the alarmist headlines, dire warnings and daily predictions of disaster. Never mind that stock markets, by their nature, rise and fall, or that the loonie's latest decline is an extension of a 15-year slide; caveats like these can ruin a good panic. And a panic, abetted by an always-eager media, provides a perfect opportunity for religious fanatics of all stripes to advance their own brand of salvation. Lately, it has been tax cuts.
The drumbeat started some years ago in the financial press, within the Reform Party caucus and in other redoubts of the right, and has now reached the finance minister's office. So eager is Martin to reward long-suffering Canadians with a tax break this winter that he is apparently ready to appropriate the Employment Insurance fund, with its tempting $6 billion surplus -- enough, Martin's hopes, to offset an expected $4 billion shortfall in anticipated federal revenues.
But will tax cuts stimulate a floundering economy, avert a recession and compensate for interest rate increases as its champions suggest? That depends on how large the tax cut is and how widely shared. Across-the-board cuts, which attract most attention - - for an ambitious finance minister, a crucial consideration -- are also the most costly. In fact, they are so costly that Martin won't likely be able to afford anything more than a token gesture -- "enough to buy a radio, but not a car" in the words of ministerial adviser Bob Brown.
Why waste money on an ineffectual tax cut? Martin has a sophisticated grasp of economics and politics; if he proceeds with a general tax cut it will be the politician speaking, although he may not be saying what people, outside of his highly-paid advisers, want to hear.
Pollster Frank Graves of Ekos Research says repeated soundings show Canadians think taxes are too high, but rank cuts below other priorities, like shoring up medicare and retiring the debt. For his part, Graves doesn't object to tax relief, but he rightly accuses its most ardent advocates of being "disingenuous" and "self- interested" when advancing broad-based cuts as an economic cure- all. "I'm surprised," he says, "they weren't suggested as a solution to climate change or El Nino."
In the end, several apparently contradictory things are true. The economic situation isn't as bad as it seems and it could get much worse. Beware of the "expert" with one bright idea. And remember: the fundamentals are right. Or are they?

Full text: Matthew Rees's Aug. 27 column, "What ever happened to global cooling?" should be clipped by debating coaches and used to help students learn how to present an argument when they draw the negative. He displays a real talent for false debate.
The question he asks about global cooling is specious, an attempt to throw the opposition off guard. Several hundred of the world's leading scientists have devoted years to studying the climate and have concluded climate change is a real threat, and that the world must act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Rees's sources are 20-year-old newspaper and magazine reports.
Mr. Rees then attempts to malign the source rather than refute the facts -- an ancient debating trick. The world's leading climate scientists, he suggests, are working with inadequate computers. It's a plot by bureaucrats and politicians to grab more power. It's promoted by "enviromantics" and "Luddites" -- heck, Al Gore's one of them.
That softens up the audience for the next ploy, "the flawed half- study." The DRI study Mr. Rees quotes was designed to find the negative costs and did not look at the positive economic impacts of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Of course, if we just raise the price of coal and oil and no one figures out how to be more efficient or how to take a advantage of worldwide boom in conservation and renewable technology etc., the economy will be devastated.
There are plenty of other studies that show the cost of not acting on global warming is much higher than acting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Just ask the insurance industry. It reported last week that the Great Ice Storm of '98 cost four times more than any weather event in Canadian history. And just wait for the bills from Bonnie.
The next manoeuvre in a good debate is to go for the heart- strings of your audience. What would be better than cars and death? The "enviromantics" are going to stuff you into a tiny plastic car and kill you in a collision. He failed to mention that about 50,000 Americans already die in cars every year (4,000 in Canada) and about 2.5 million are injured (250,000 in Canada). Nor did he point out that reducing the size of cars is not the only way to make them more efficient and less polluting. (If a fact undermines the argument, leave it out.)
You can't leave the audience thinking about death and destruction. Say something uplifting at the end to put them in a good mood to judge the debate. So Mr. Rees tells us we are healthy, wealthy and (he implies) wise. What could be more uplifting?
He failed to mention that the air pollution is killing thousands of Americans and Canadians every year and making millions sick, and that cancer is rampant in both countries. We do suffer less from infectious disease but will we once the climate changes and subtropical diseases move north?
This "enviromantic" loves a good debate and Mr. Rees is a great debater. But the facts prove him wrong. Acting to reduce greenhouse gases will result in new economic opportunities, less air pollution, healthier people and better more livable cities. The healthy, wealthy and wise move.

Abstract: It may well get hotter still. According to the World Energy Council, annual global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) have risen by 9 per cent since 1990, and they will continue to rise as world population and economies grow. If we stabilized annual global CO2 emissions this year -- a very ambitious goal that is not even on the global agenda -- CO2 levels in the atmosphere would continue to rise.

Full text: Preparing for a hotter planet
Saturday, August 29, 1998
Nineteen ninety-eight is said to be the warmest year globally in the past several centuries, with Canada's July the warmest in 50 years. Environment Canada reports that the first seven months of the year were the warmest on record in Canada (which is, however, only a short time geologically). Scientists now say that satellite measurements have understated high-altitude temperatures over the past two decades, because scientists failed to correct for orbit degradation over time. Clearly, it's warmer this year than normal and the past 20 years have been generally warmer than normal.
It may well get hotter still. According to the World Energy Council, annual global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) have risen by 9 per cent since 1990, and they will continue to rise as world population and economies grow. If we stabilized annual global CO2 emissions this year -- a very ambitious goal that is not even on the global agenda -- CO2 levels in the atmosphere would continue to rise.
Most scientists say that rising CO2 levels will contribute to global warming, which may well be under way for other powerful reasons. (The Earth is still emerging from an ice age, after all, and global temperatures are still well below geological averages.) The predictive quality of Earth scientists is open to dispute, but let us assume that additional CO2 will contribute to natural global warming, and that we are in for hotter times.
In 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a report called Impacts, Adaptation and Mitigation of Climate Change. Environment magazine examined the 728 pages of text and observed that only 32 pages were devoted to adaptation. That was perhaps understandable in a political context, where making the case for CO2 reductions was the primary goal. It is not enough now in the context of real world experience.
We need another IPCC-type study focused solely on adaptation, which could well be the pressing issue for humanity in the next 50 years. Actively preparing for global warming should not be resisted on the grounds that it suggests complacency about humanity's contribution to greenhouse gases. In fact, the more visibly we prepare for the possibility of global warming, the greater the political constituency may be for possibly mitigating it through actual CO2 reductions.
According to the sketchy 1995 IPCC report, the greatest impact is likely to be on agriculture in equatorial zones. This suggests an analysis of alternatives to current crops in hot climes, and the development of food supply systems for highly exposed peoples, most of whom are poor.
Rising sea levels caused by warmer water (which expands with heat) and melting glaciers would threaten many coastal areas, including places such as New York City, London and the Netherlands, not to mention Bangladesh and many tropical islands. Adaptation strategies would have to range from dike protection (as exists already across the Thames in London) to orderly abandonment (bye bye Greenwich Village). Insurance coverage, land-use regulation and environmental rules need to be reviewed. Should we allow people to build in newly identified flood-prone spots, or to buy insurance if they do?
The implications for human health range from expanding malaria territories to safer winter conditions in northern climes. Vaccination and sanitation programs will need to be reconsidered. Vast public-health information programs will be required if the planet really does heat up.
Warmer climates will lead to expanding ranges for certain flora and fauna. It has been suggested in North America that natural corridors be created to allow for the orderly migration north of tree species and animals. University agriculture faculties might well undertake research on the speedy conversion of boreal soils to food production, which would help offset agricultural losses in the tropics.
We need analyses of potential water and electricity use in light of warmer temperatures, even in places such as Canada which have an abundance of both. More irrigation, air conditioning and pressure to export water are likely in the face of hotter summers.
Some predict that tens of millions of refugees in the tropics will attempt to emigrate north, as their arable soil and the land itself erodes. This could lead to considerable conflict in neighbouring states and moral dilemmas for everyone else.
While much work is done on potential adaptation strategies, we also need much more work on the economic consequences and choices that come with serious commitments to CO2 reduction. It may or may not be relevant, but the vagueness about the effects of possible CO2 reduction strategies almost equals that about the scope of possible adaptations to much more temperate climes.
The intellectual work on what to do about what may be inevitable in global warming has barely begun.

Abstract: A "GREEN" windfall tax looks set is to be levied on the gas and electricity generators, with the aim of raising prices to force industry to cut excessive energy use and cut harmful emissions. Some Whitehall insiders estimate the Chancellor could raise pounds 5bn in an energy tax which could be unveiled in the Chancellor's pre- budget statement in the autumn. Ministers said the aim of the tax was to reduce the waste of energy, not to raise revenue for the Treasury, but it could give the Chancellor a bonus for the general election campaign.

Full text: A "GREEN" windfall tax looks set is to be levied on the gas and electricity generators, with the aim of raising prices to force industry to cut excessive energy use and cut harmful emissions.
Some Whitehall insiders estimate the Chancellor could raise pounds 5bn in an energy tax which could be unveiled in the Chancellor's pre- budget statement in the autumn.
Ministers said the aim of the tax was to reduce the waste of energy, not to raise revenue for the Treasury, but it could give the Chancellor a bonus for the general election campaign.
"It is big money and it is implementing our Kyoto targets on {carbon dioxide}, making industry more efficient and giving them incentives to cut waste in energy," said a ministerial source.
Whitehall sources said the Chancellor was planning to offset the extra burden on industry by offering tax breaks, but it will still mean that some companies will face higher charges, which they may have to pass on to their customers, unless stopped from doing so by the regulators.
The tax breaks could include cuts in National Insurance contributions for industries hit by the tax to make it cheaper to hire workers, and to prevent the move contributing to a rise in unemployment.
Big users of energy, such as the steel industry, who are already efficient, could be given special exemptions. Officials believe the main targets will be middle-range firms, heavy users of gas and electricity who have room for more efficiency.
The appointment of Sir Colin Marshall, the President of the Confederation of British Industry, to head the review of an energy tax, announced in last year's budget, was seen by the "green" lobby as a signal that big business would be able to head off the threat of a tax, when it was announced in the Budget by the Chancellor.
But although Sir Colin's task-force of Whitehall officials has yet to finish its report, Whitehall insiders have told The Independent that Sir Colin's review is expected to come down firmly in favour of an energy tax on industry.
"If we had appointed somebody like Jonathon Porritt from Friends of the Earth, business would never have bought it, but Sir Colin will be able to sell it to big business," said a senior ministerial source. "His appointment makes it more likely, not less likely, that there will be a big industry energy tax."
Ministers believe Mr Brown will go ahead with the tax in his next Budget in the spring, next year. It would be imposed on the generators, making it easy for the Government to collect, and automatically passed to big industrial users of energy. "The idea is to get industry to be much more efficient in the way it uses energy," said the source.
The Government could be accused of breaking its election pledge to make the windfall tax on the privatised a "one-off" to fund its welfare- to-work programme. But Mr Brown said in the Budget that the task-force, bringing together people from industry and Whitehall, "shows that the Government and the private sector can achieve more working together".
In June, Sir Colin launched a consultation paper on the idea of an energy tax, saying there was a "need for industry and commerce to make a contribution towards tackling climate change".
The closing date for submissions was the end of July. The task force is also looking at a trading scheme in energy or carbon emissions, which would enable firms to "buy" permits from competitors.
At the Kyoto conference last year, the European Union committed itself to a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases of 8 per cent below 1990 levels by 2008 to 2012. The UK has its own target of a 20 per cent cut in carbon dioxide emissions on 1990 levels by 2010.

Leaving a Legacy: As Clinton Testifies, Another Jury Weighs His Place in History --- Scholars Have Become Kinder To Less-Activist Leaders, But Scandals Will Hurt --- A New Model: Ulysses Grant

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Today, Bill Clinton makes history. But it isn't the kind of history he had hoped for.
Mr. Clinton has often looked to past presidents for models. At his first inaugural, he echoed Franklin Roosevelt's call for "bold, persistent experimentation." Two years later, confronted with the first Republican Congress in 40 years, he turned to "Give 'em hell" Harry Truman. By his re-election, he was recalling Theodore Roosevelt, who made his mark in a time of peace at the turn of the last century.
More recently, as the Monica Lewinsky affair swirled about him, he mused that scandal-tarred Ulysses S. Grant had gotten "a bum rap."
In advance of Mr. Clinton's grand-jury testimony today, some advisers intimated that he might revise his prior account of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, though his attorney dismissed that as "groundless speculation."
How will history view William Jefferson Clinton? Will he be remembered more for today's role as the first president to testify before a grand jury in a criminal case? Or will other accomplishments transcend the scandals that dog him? With two years left in his second term, few historians want to hazard a judgment. For any president, it's agreed, verdicts are best left to later generations.
But it is clear that Mr. Clinton hasn't been the Rooseveltian activist he once hoped to be. And history's judges have long been partial to doers and crisis managers. Peace and prosperity, ever the stuff of campaign promises, don't lend themselves to great deeds and legacy-building.
"Clinton's great problem is, he came in with high aspirations, [but he] is in a period where no one particularly wants to do very much, and he has a Republican Congress to deal with," says Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who, along with his late father, did much to define the activist yardstick by which presidents have been judged for a half-century.
Yet perhaps it is Mr. Clinton's fabled luck that historians these days seem to be taking a kinder view of chief executives who managed America rather than changed it. Like Dwight Eisenhower, or even "Silent Cal" Coolidge, the subject of a two-day re-examination at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston last month. The irony of Mr. Clinton's quest for a legacy is that his best hope may be to take a place among these GOP presidents, remembered less for their activism than for their quiet handling of prosperous times.
That's not to say Mr. Clinton hasn't been active. He helped balance the budget after three decades of red ink, promoted free trade, preached eloquently from the bully pulpit for racial healing, overhauled welfare and steered his party's politics to the middle. But experience and defeat, chiefly on health-care reform, chastened him. He has sought an activism within limits, and the FDR echoes gave way to Mr. Clinton's utterance that "the era of big government is over."
For years, critics have complained of a liberal bias in scholars' presidential ratings, with insufficient credit given to those who simply managed things or stopped bad ideas. Historian Richard Norton Smith, a self-described Rockefeller Republican, and Herbert Hoover's friendly biographer as well as George Washington's, calls the notion of liberal bias "simplistic." But he says there has been a bias -- for "conflict and drama centralized in Washington." The 20th-century judges favor "the activist president, the visionary, the man who personalizes the office as he centralizes power, to overawe Congress and set the national agenda, and to use the media."
Mr. Smith longs for "a pre-New Deal presidential model," and suggests that "a new consensus may be emerging." After Vietnam and Watergate, historians began rethinking their romance with strong presidents. In Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson, they saw the dangers of the "imperial presidency." As the century wanes, scholars have developed more appreciation for the checks and balances provided by a strong Congress, and for the import of actions beyond Washington.
Still, in judging legacies, Mr. Smith and other conservatives generally come to the same bottom-line conclusions about past presidents' relative standing as have liberals like the Schlesingers.
"If a president doesn't do things, he doesn't make much of a mark," says Mr. Schlesinger. "That doesn't necessarily mean an extension of government or presidential authority. It means the ability to rise to a challenge."
First, of course, a president must face a challenge -- the bigger, the better. And in times like the present, the challenges may defy greatness. Lincoln biographer David Herbert Donald recalls that, during a 1962 visit to the White House, John Kennedy asked him "if it's necessary to have a war to be a great president. I was stunned, because he was after all the president and he wanted to be a great president."
Mr. Kennedy's predecessor, Mr. Eisenhower, has suffered as much as any president against the activist yardstick, despite his contemporary popularity and his two terms. Yet perhaps no president has so benefited from time's perspective, and from the yardstick's reassessment.
Contrast Mr. Schlesinger Sr.'s 1962 update of his pioneering presidential poll, which first appeared in Life magazine 50 years ago, with his son's update two years ago. Mr. Eisenhower went from 22nd among the 31 presidents rated in 1962, a year after leaving office, to 14th of the 39 presidents rated in 1996. In other recent surveys, he rates even better. His presidential papers had become available, showing historians a more engaged figure behind the scenes than the semi-retired First Duffer of public image.
Recently, the president and historians alike have paid new attention to the so-called forgotten men of the late 19th century. These caretaker presidents - -men like Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes -- are a blur between Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt; most served one term or less, and were overshadowed by Congresses after the Civil War. But, of interest to Mr. Clinton, their end-of-century Gilded Age parallels the present for being a time of economic transition and melting-pot pressures.
Asked late last year about his own legacy, Mr. Clinton proposed this epitaph: "He had to make America work in a new world." The president predicted scholars would ask: "Did I help America transform itself so that we would still be the greatest nation in the world in a global economy" while uniting "the most . . . diverse population in our history?"
For many in the Clinton circle, the hand-lettered sign from his 1992 campaign headquarters -- "It's the Economy, Stupid" -- serves just as well as an answer to speculation about his legacy. History's judgment, of course, depends on a continued good economy, and on Mr. Clinton's getting credit for it.
His claim rests on the 1993 deficit-reduction package pushed through over unanimous GOP opposition, and the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement approved over his own party's objections; his veto of the 1995 GOP plan for tax and social-spending cuts; and his negotiation of the 1997 budget compromise. Before Mr. Clinton, says political adviser Rahm Emanuel, "America had economically lost its zap and bounce. We had come to accept the deficit and debt as a fait accompli."
With the aim of helping Americans in the transition from a factory-based economy to the information age, Mr. Clinton has also sought, within severe budget constraints, to expand higher-education opportunities, put computers in schools and provide tax credits and familyleave policies to ease working families' pressures. The first president elected since the Cold War was won, Mr. Clinton also has taken a more interventionist role in foreign affairs than suggested by his 1992 campaign, during which he attacked President Bush as being preoccupied with foreign affairs.
In Mr. Schlesinger's introduction to his 1996 survey, he wrote that the president was poised between greatness and humiliation. "It's still a toss-up," the historian says. Since that survey, Mr. Clinton has won re-election and reached last year's balanced-budget agreement with the GOP Congress. The president who failed disastrously in 1994 to pass universal health insurance won laws expanding uninsured children's coverage and protecting insurance for some workers who lose or change jobs. As much as anything, that contrast illustrated Mr. Clinton's adjustment to a more limited activism.
But he will be hard-put to add to his achievements in his final two years. Second terms are traditionally frustrating, and the parties already are facing off for the 2000 election. He is distracted and weakened by scandal.
That has taken its toll on his agenda, despite the public's continued high job-approval ratings. Congressional Republicans have buried his major tobacco bill, which promised billions in future revenues for health and other domestic programs. They've ignored his proposal to expand Medicare for those approaching retirement age. And they are gunning for his domestic-spending initiatives.
What's more, the issues Mr. Clinton has staked out for the remainder of his term -- "saving" Social Security, and action against climate change -- are huge challenges.
Mr. Clinton's aides argue that his plans to overhaul Social Security and head off its insolvency when baby boomers retire could earn him a measure of greatness. "This would be a historic thing, to take a major problem like this and do something about it before it actually happens," says Martha Phillips, executive director of the nonpartisan budget watchdog Concord Coalition, which is helping coordinate Mr. Clinton's public-education effort on the issue. From top administration officials, Mrs. Phillips says, "I get every sense they're serious about this."
A serious effort against global warming would also be a major undertaking, requiring emissions reductions that could result in costly adjustments for industry and consumers. That is one reason most analysts believe the administration's globalwarming push will result more in rhetoric than action.
Moreover, the politics of either global warming or Social Security hold big risks for another of Mr. Clinton's hoped-for legacies-getting Vice President Al Gore elected, and thus extending the "New Democrat" coalition. Mr. Gore's victory is the necessary first step to proving whether Mr. Clinton's centrist formula -- picked up even by some moderate Republican governors and foreign leaders such as Britain's Tony Blair -- has staying power.
Whatever happens, as Mr. Clinton must know by his ruminations on Mr. Grant, scandal is always an albatross. In the Grant case, guilt was by association with corrupt cronies, not personal malfeasance. Mr. Nixon's disgrace, making him the only president to resign, is in a class by itself. Pop history already provides a warning to Mr. Clinton. Writer Nathan Miller, making changes as his book "Star-Spangled Men: America's Ten Worst Presidents" goes to paperback publication, weighed whether to include Bill Clinton in William Howard Taft's place. But he decided "it's premature. The jury is still out -- both literally and figuratively."
Mr. Clinton's case, with its unprecedented focus on sexual relationships, breaks uncharted ground. "There aren't any lessons from the past because, let's face it, we've defined scandal down," says Brookings Institution scholar Thomas Mann. "We don't have a clue as to whether, 30 years from now, people will look back on this as a host of trivial matters that were lent stature by a law for an independent counsel -- and by a political culture that acted in a crazy and irrational way -- or whether in fact something consequential comes out."
One Clinton legacy could be a counterreaction to the way the country approaches corruption allegations. Columbia University historian Alan Brinkley has decried "the institutionalization of scandal," owed to the post-Watergate law that triggers appointment of independent counsels and the permanence of Congress's self-appointed ethics committees. Many predict that the independent-counsel law will be altered or repealed.
However Washington's scandal culture might change, Mr. Clinton's record will have to stand on its own. It's "a credible record" so far, says Mr. Donald, the Lincoln biographer. "The question is whether he has so undercut his moral authority, or his enemies have, that he can no longer speak for the American people."
At work on another Lincoln book, Mr. Donald stays immersed in the life of the president most often deemed the nation's greatest, only to shift daily to the tawdry news from the current White House. But, he says, "I go through the New York Herald of the 1860s, and there's hardly a day you don't read Lincoln's a fool, a charlatan, a baboon, and worse."
So, as for Mr. Clinton, he says, "I like to reserve judgment."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Today, Bill Clinton makes history. But it isn't the kind of history he had hoped for.
Mr. Clinton has often looked to past presidents for models. At his first inaugural, he echoed Franklin Roosevelt's call for "bold, persistent experimentation." Two years later, confronted with the first Republican Congress in 40 years, he turned to "Give `em hell" Harry Truman. By his re-election, he was recalling Theodore Roosevelt, who made his mark in a time of peace at the turn of the last century.
More recently, as the Monica Lewinsky affair swirled about him, he mused that scandal-tarred Ulysses S. Grant had gotten "a bum rap."
How will history view William Jefferson Clinton? Will he be remembered more for today's role as the first president to testify before a grand jury in a criminal case? Or will other accomplishments transcend the scandals that dog him? With two years left in his second term, few historians want to hazard a judgment. For any president, it's agreed, verdicts are best left to later generations.
But it is clear that Mr. Clinton hasn't been the Rooseveltian activist he once hoped to be. And history's judges have long been partial to doers and crisis managers. Peace and prosperity, ever the stuff of campaign promises, don't lend themselves to great deeds and legacy-building.
"Clinton's great problem is, he came in with high aspirations, {but he} is in a period where no one particularly wants to do very much, and he has a Republican Congress to deal with," says Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who, along with his late father, did much to define the activist yardstick by which presidents have been judged for a half-century.
Yet perhaps it is Mr. Clinton's fabled luck that historians these days seem to be taking a kinder view of chief executives who managed America rather than changed it. Like Dwight Eisenhower, or even "Silent Cal" Coolidge, the subject of a two-day re-examination at the John F. Kennedy Library in Massachusetts last month. The irony of Mr. Clinton's quest for a legacy is that his best hope may be to take a place among these Republican presidents, remembered less for their activism than for their quiet handling of prosperous times.
That's not to say Mr. Clinton hasn't been active. He helped balance the budget after three decades of red ink, promoted free trade, preached eloquently from the bully pulpit for racial healing, overhauled welfare and steered his party's politics to the middle. But experience and defeat, chiefly on health-care reform, chastened him. He has sought an activism within limits, and the FDR echoes gave way to Mr. Clinton's utterance that "the era of big government is over."
For years, critics have complained of a liberal bias in scholars' presidential ratings, with insufficient credit given to those who simply managed things or stopped bad ideas. Historian Richard Norton Smith, a self-described Rockefeller Republican, and Herbert Hoover's friendly biographer as well as George Washington's, calls the notion of liberal bias "simplistic." But he says there has been a bias for "conflict and drama centralized in Washington." The 20th-century judges favor "the activist president, the visionary, the man who personalizes the office as he centralizes power, to overawe Congress and set the national agenda, and to use the media."
Mr. Smith longs for "a pre-New Deal presidential model," and suggests that "a new consensus may be emerging." After Vietnam and Watergate, historians began rethinking their romance with strong presidents. In Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson, they saw the dangers of the "imperial presidency." As the century wanes, scholars have developed more appreciation for the checks and balances provided by a strong Congress, and for the import of actions beyond Washington.
Still, in judging legacies, Mr. Smith and other conservatives generally come to the same bottom-line conclusions about past presidents' relative standing as have liberals like the Schlesingers.
"If a president doesn't do things, he doesn't make much of a mark," says Mr. Schlesinger. "That doesn't necessarily mean an extension of government or presidential authority. It means the ability to rise to a challenge."
First, of course, a president must face a challenge -- the bigger, the better. And in times like the present, the challenges may defy greatness. Lincoln biographer David Herbert Donald recalls that, during a 1962 visit to the White House, John Kennedy asked him "if it's necessary to have a war to be a great president. I was stunned, because he was after all the president -- and he wanted to be a great president."
Mr. Kennedy's predecessor, Mr. Eisenhower, has suffered as much as any president against the activist yardstick, despite his contemporary popularity and his two terms. Yet perhaps no president has so benefited from time's perspective, and from the yardstick's reassessment.
Contrast Mr. Schlesinger Sr.'s 1962 update of his pioneering presidential poll, which first appeared in Life magazine 50 years ago, with his son's update two years ago. Mr. Eisenhower went from 22nd among the 31 presidents rated in 1962, a year after leaving office, to 14th of the 39 presidents rated in 1996. In other recent surveys, he rates even better. His presidential papers became available, showing historians a more engaged figure behind-the-scenes than the semiretired First Duffer of public image.
Recently, the president and historians alike have paid new attention to the so-called "forgotten men" of the late 19th century. These caretaker presidents -- men like Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes -- are a blur between Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt; most served one term or less and were overshadowed by Congresses after the Civil War. But, of interest to Mr. Clinton, their end-of-century Gilded Age parallels the present for being a time of economic transition and melting-pot pressures.
Asked late last year about his own legacy, Mr. Clinton proposed this epitaph: "He had to make America work in a new world." The president predicted scholars would ask: "Did I help America transform itself so that we would still be the greatest nation in the world in a global economy" while uniting "the most ... diverse population in our history?"
For many in the Clinton circle, the hand-lettered sign from his 1992 campaign headquarters -- "It's the Economy, Stupid" -- serves just as well as an answer to speculation about his legacy. History's judgment, of course, depends on a continued good economy, and on Mr. Clinton's getting credit for it.
His claim rests on the 1993 deficit-reduction package pushed through despite unanimous Republican opposition, and the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement approved over his own party's objections; his veto of the 1995 Republican plan for tax and social-spending cuts; and his negotiation of the 1997 budget compromise. Before Mr. Clinton, says political adviser Rahm Emanuel, "America had economically lost its zap and bounce. We had come to accept the deficit and debt as a fait accompli."
With the aim of helping Americans in the transition from a factory-based economy to the information age, Mr. Clinton has also sought, within severe budget constraints, to expand higher-education opportunities, put computers in schools and provide tax credits and family-leave policies to ease working families' pressures. The first president elected since the Cold War was won, Mr. Clinton also has taken a more interventionist role in foreign affairs than his 1992 campaign suggested, during which he attacked President Bush as being preoccupied with foreign affairs.
In Mr. Schlesinger's introduction to his 1996 survey, he wrote that the president was poised between greatness and humiliation. "It's still a toss-up," the historian says. Since that survey, Mr. Clinton has won re-election and reached last year's balanced-budget agreement with the Republican Congress. The president, who failed disastrously in 1994 to pass universal health insurance, won laws expanding uninsured children's coverage and protecting insurance for some workers who lose or change jobs. As much as anything, that contrast illustrated Mr. Clinton's adjustment to a more limited activism.
But he will be hard-put to add to his achievements in his final two years. Second terms are traditionally frustrating, and the parties already are facing off for the 2000 election. He is distracted and weakened by scandal.
That has taken its toll on his agenda, despite the public's continued high job-approval ratings. Congressional Republicans have buried his major tobacco bill, which promised billions in future revenues for health and other domestic programs. They've ignored his proposal to expand Medicare for those approaching retirement age. And they are gunning for his domestic spending initiatives.
What's more, the issues Mr. Clinton has staked out for the remainder of his term -- "saving" Social Security, and action against climate change -- are huge challenges.
Mr. Clinton's aides argue that his plans to overhaul Social Security and head off its insolvency when baby boomers retire could earn him a measure of greatness. "This would be a historic thing, to take a major problem like this and do something about it before it actually happens," says Martha Phillips, executive director of the non-partisan budget watchdog Concord Coalition, which is helping coordinate Mr. Clinton's public-education effort on the issue. From top administration officials, Mrs. Phillips says, "I get every sense they're serious about this."
A serious effort against global warming would also be a major undertaking, requiring emissions reductions that could result in costly adjustments for industry and consumers. That is one reason most analysts believe the administration's global-warming push will result more in rhetoric than action.
Moreover, the politics of either global warming or Social Security hold big risks for another of Mr. Clinton's hoped-for legacies -- getting Vice President Al Gore elected, and thus extending the "New Democrat" coalition. Mr. Gore's victory is the necessary first step to proving whether Mr. Clinton's centrist formula -- picked up even by some moderate Republican governors and foreign leaders such as Britain's Tony Blair -- has staying power.
Whatever happens, as Mr. Clinton must know by his ruminations on Mr. Grant, scandal is always an albatross. In the Grant case, guilt was by association with corrupt cronies, not personal malfeasance. Mr. Nixon's disgrace, making him the only president to resign, is in a class by itself. Pop history already provides a warning to Mr. Clinton. Writer Nathan Miller, making changes as his book "Star-Spangled Men: America's Ten Worst Presidents" goes to paperback publication, weighed whether to include Bill Clinton in William Howard Taft's place. But he decided "it's premature. The jury is still out -- both literally and figuratively."
Mr. Clinton's case, with its unprecedented focus on sexual relationships, breaks uncharted ground. "There aren't any lessons from the past because, let's face it, we've defined scandal down," says Brookings Institution scholar Thomas Mann. "We don't have a clue as to whether, 30 years from now, people will look back on this as a host of trivial matters that were lent stature by a law for an independent counsel -- and by a political culture that acted in a crazy and irrational way -- or whether in fact something consequential comes out."
One Clinton legacy could be a counterreaction to the way the country approaches corruption allegations. Columbia University historian Alan Brinkley has decried "the institutionalization of scandal," owed to the post-Watergate law that triggers appointment of independent counsels and the permanence of Congress's self-appointed ethics committees.

Full text: As Texas endures the slow, agonizing death of our entire agricultural sector by drought, a check of our media and political leaders shows we are also suffering from a bizarre silence on a topic that could be described as "the cause that dare not speak its name."
Local newspapers have responded heroically to the heat wave that has now killed more than 120 Texans, unleashing a torrent of community efforts to help those most in peril, keeping people informed of water shortages and conservation plans. The one topic they have not addressed is: Why is this happening?
Of the few articles on the subject, all are limited to the answer "El Nino," which is half right. According to climatologists, this is an El Nino drought: El Nino shifted the jet stream just enough to hold the high that normally sits over the Rockies east over Texas, so we are not getting the clouds and cooling that normally give us some relief. But the other half of the answer, global warming, has gotten little or no attention.
The media are doing so poorly on this issue that it's an embarrassment to the profession, and we are being hoist partly by the petard of our infamous "objectivity." We continue to report global warming as though it were a "debate" among scientists. It is not.
(Actually, there is a debate among scientists on global warming, but it is over exactly how much and how fast it is happening, not whether it exists.)
What we mistake for a "debate" is actually a public relations campaign by the American Petroleum Institute, which has recruited and funded a few scientists who question the entire phenomenon. They, in turn, are given equal weight by the media, as though they were precisely as objective as the 2,500 scientists who work with the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
According to USA Today, when 14 energy industry lobbyists gathered in April to work out the details of a $6-million lobbying plan on global warming, they targeted Congress, the news media, the public and schoolchildren. "Informing teachers/students about uncertainties in climate science will begin to erect a barrier against further efforts to impose Kyoto-like measures in the future," says a memo from the meeting obtained by the National Environmental Trust.
The notion that the U.N. panel is some group of fear-mongering enviros is easily disproved by study of any of its cautious work or the testimony of its chairman, Robert T. Watson. On the other hand, the petroleum institute's PR campaign is designed, in the words of its own strategy documents, to "reposition global warming as theory rather than fact." And it has been quite successful.
In addition, a number of conservative think tanks have been churning out dubious studies allegedly proving that doing much of anything about global warming will cost each and every citizen a small fortune and "radically" affect all our lives. These studies have been given solemn coverage by the press.
Perhaps the funniest media blooper so far was to bite on what purported to be a petition sponsored by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine and signed by "16,000 scientists," all of whom agree that global warming is hooey. It turns out that the institute is a small outfit in Cave Junction, Ore., run by a biochemist who specializes in home schooling and nuclear shelters. The petition was put on the Internet; anyone who claimed to be a scientist could "sign." Among the 16,000 "scientists" were the real name of Ginger Spice of the Spice Girls, Dr. B.J. Hunnicut of "MASH" and a raft of other patently ridiculous names, none of which were checked.
Among the most important developments this year is the formation of a coalition of major companies--including Sun Co., 3M, British Petroleum, Lockheed, Maytag, United Technologies, Boeing--that not only accept climate change as a serious threat but also believe that action is necessary and can be taken without economic damage. Of course, the one industry with the largest stake in all this is insurance, which has taken the problem seriously for years. According to Ross Gelbspan, author of "The Heat Is On," insurance losses in the 1980s averaged $2 billion a year; in the 1990s, they have been averaging close to $12 billion a year.
Meanwhile, the Republican Party of Texas has adopted the flat statement: "We oppose the theory of global warming and the Kyoto agreement." That certainly takes care of that as far as Texas Republicans are concerned.

Full text:   AUSTIN, Texas -- As Texas endures the slow, agonizing death of our entire agricultural sector by drought, a check of our media and political leaders shows we are also suffering from a bizarre silence on a topic that could be described as "the cause that dare not speak its name."
Local newspapers have responded heroically to the heat wave that has now killed more than 120 Texans, unleashing a torrent of community efforts to help those most in peril, keeping people informed of water shortages and conservation plans, and praising the emergency and medical workers who are saving lives. The one topic they have not addressed is: Why is this happening?
Of the few articles on the subject, all are limited to the answer "El Nino," which is half right. According to climatologists, this is an El Nino drought: El Nino shifted the jet stream just enough to hold the high that normally sits over the Rockies in the summertime east over Texas, so we are not getting the clouds and cooling that normally give us some relief. But the other half of the answer, global warming, has gotten little or no attention.
The media are doing so poorly on this issue that it's an embarrassment to the profession, and we are being hoist partly by the petard of our infamous "objectivity." We continue to report global warming as though it were a "debate" among scientists. It is not.
What we mistake for a "debate" is actually a public relations campaign by the American Petroleum Institute, which has recruited and funded a few scientists who question the entire phenomenon. They, in turn, are given equal weight by the media, as though they were precisely as objective as the 2,500 scientists who work with the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
According to USA Today, when 14 energy industry lobbyists gathered in April to work out the details of a $6 million lobbying plan on global warming, they targeted Congress, the news media, the public and . . . schoolchildren. "Informing teachers/students about uncertainties in climate science will begin to erect a barrier against further efforts to impose Kyoto-like measures in the future," says a memo from the meeting obtained by the National Environmental Trust.
The notion that the IPCC is some group of fear-mongering enviros is easily disproved by study of any of its cautious work or the testimony of its chairman, Robert T. Watson. On the other hand, the API's notorious PR campaign is designed, in the words of its own strategy documents, to "reposition global warming as theory rather than fact." And it has been quite successful at doing so. In a Newsweek poll, as reported by writer Ross Gelbspan, conducted in 1991, 35 percent said it believed global warming was a serious problem; by 1996, the number had dropped to 22 percent.
In addition, a number of conservative think tanks have been churning out dubious studies allegedly proving that doing much of anything about global warming will cost each and every citizen a small fortune and "radically" affect all our lives. These studies have been given solemn coverage by the press.
Perhaps the funniest media blooper so far was to bite on what purported to be a petition sponsored by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine and signed by "16,000 scientists," all of whom agree that global warming is hooey. It turns out that the institute is a small outfit in Cave Junction, Ore., run by a biochemist who specializes in home schooling and building nuclear shelters. The petition was put on the Internet; anyone who claimed to be a scientist could "sign" and be counted. Enviros soon caught on, and among the 16,000 "scientists," they added, among others, the real name of Ginger Spice of the Spice Girls, Dr. B.J. Hunnicut of "MASH," actor Michael J. Fox and a raft of other patently ridiculous names, none of which were checked.
Among the most important developments this year is the formation of a coalition of major companies -- including Sun Co., 3M, British Petroleum, Lockheed, Maytag, United Technologies, Boeing, etc. -- that not only accept climate change as a serious threat but also believe that action is necessary and can be taken without economic damage. Of course, the one industry with the largest stake in all this is insurance, which has taken the problem seriously for years. According to Gelbspan, insurance losses in the 1980s averaged $2 billion a year; in the 1990s, they have been averaging close to $12 billion a year.
Meanwhile, the Republican Party of Texas has adopted the flat statement: "We oppose the theory of global warming and the Kyoto Agreement." That certainly takes care of that as far as Texas Republicans are concerned.

Full text:   S. David Freeman is the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Write to him in care of Daily News Opinions, P.O. Box 4200, Woodland Hills, CA 91365-4200.
SMACK in the middle of the hottest days of summer, it is easy to dismiss the headline-stealing heat wave as just another blast of hot air. But mounting evidence suggests that the incredible thermometer readings may be a sneak preview of future weather patterns.
The phenomenon known as global warming is very real, and we need to recognize the danger and make out an "insurance policy" to cover the risk.
Warmer and extreme weather, a measured rise in the sea level, and increasing threats on natural ecosystems worldwide forecast a troubling future for the planet unless bold, affirmative steps are taken to reduce the emission of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into our atmosphere.
I call attention to this problem as a utility executive whose power system is part of the problem but is moving to "come clean."
Carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas, is produced by the burning of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide in the air does indeed create a greenhouse effect, and without it, the Earth would experience Ice Age-type conditions with an average temperature some 60 degrees cooler than it is today.
The concern is that we are making the greenhouse stronger and the earth hotter. Concentrations have increased 30 percent since pre- industrial times. Now, scientists using leading-edge computer models estimate that carbon dioxide emissions could double by 2100, producing the highest level of CO2 in 50 million years.
"Global warming is a relatively small change from year to year, but it is always pushing in one direction," Kevin Trenberth, one of the government's leading researchers studying climate change, said recently.
Studies show that the 20th century has been the warmest in 600 years - with the 1990s the warmest decade, and 1997 the single warmest year. With greenhouse gases blanketing Earth at current rates, the United Nations Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change projects that global temperatures could rise 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 100 years - a change sufficient enough to trigger extreme conditions, including the melting of the huge west Antarctic ice sheer.
Other impacts could include reduced crop yields; an erosion of coastal land mass; increased health hazards from heat stress to respiratory illness; and degradation of the world's forests.
A worst-case glimpse of the potential future impact of global warming is this year's heat-related devastation in Texas. Three weeks of consecutive 100-degree days has caused nearly 100 deaths and over $1 billion in crop damage. In Florida, drought-fed fires ravaged the terrain, contributing to billion-dollar losses in that state. Agricultural officials are issuing disaster declarations throughout the southwest United States. Even in the usual temperature climate of the Pacific Northwest, thermometers have topped 108 degrees in places including Walla Walla, Washington.
No one is saying this is the smoking gun that proves global warming is a killer, but it sure looks like it could be. And the scientific evidence indicates that rising levels of carbon dioxide are causing bad weather to become worse and more frequent.
Global warming is a real risk that is here and now, and the responsibility for reversing the current course rests with us all. The utility industry, which is a major contributor to global warming, should take an active leadership role in promoting and implementing programs to protect the global environment. I intend to do just that.
For starters, the industry should make investments now to reduce its reliance on coal-fired generation plants in favor of green power alternatives such as solar, wind and hydropower. As the nation's largest municipal utility, drawing nearly 60 percent of its electricity from coal-fired power plants in the western U.S., the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is poised to become a leader in the use of these more environmentally friendly generation options.
We are proposing a green power program for consumers to pay $3-$5 a month to fund new clean energy. This slight increase can be more than offset by cash credits which will be offered for customers who use efficient appliances.
Utilities should all step up their programs to promote energy efficiency. The "Cool Schools" program in Los Angeles is one such example. The DWP is planting 4,000 hardy, shade-producing trees around school buildings at 42 Los Angeles Unified School District campuses to reduce energy use for air conditioning. The environmental benefit is reduced carbon dioxide emissions and improved air quality.
The DWP also is distributing energy-efficient appliances, such as refrigerators and washing machines, to low-income residents and providing rebates to other customers who purchase these energy efficient products.
Utility executives should do more than just loosen their ties and oppose regulations in dealing with global warming. The industry can drive market demand for environmentally friendly products and programs, such as electric cars and buses, residential solar energy systems, highly advanced energy efficient appliances and widespread tree planting.
The industry has a responsibility to voluntarily phase down its use of polluting coal-fired generation plants. Utilities that oppose regulations to reduce global warming should be mandated to do so.
While these solutions do not have the immediate cooling effect of an ice-cold glass of lemonade on a hot summer day, they do represent leadership that will insure against the very real risk of damage that may be far greater than we can imagine.

Global warming lost in Texas heat wave shuffle

An unusual amount of hot air, say experts on both meteorology and politics." Heh-heh. (Actually, there IS a debate among scientists on global warming, but it is over exactly how much and how fast it is happening, not whether it exists. The best book on the subject for serious students of meteorology is S. George Philander's "Is the Temperature Rising? The Uncertain Science of Global Warming." The best book I have found on why we are having a phony "debate" is "The Heat Is On" by Ross Gelbspan.)

Hot World, Cooler Growth Can humans progress and still preserve the home planet? A hot summer, oil merger, and Asian slump focus debate: [ALL Edition]

Abstract: Econ- and Eco- are the sound-alike prefixes scholars and politicians love to affix to their new millennium pronouncements. Broadly, the two are set against each other. They're the perceived bookends of mankind's future. Economic growth (read improved living standards) supposedly causes ecologic decline (read hotter, less green, fewer species). Conversely, eco-preservation means econo- decline. Pop wisdom says you can have one or the other, not both.

Full text:   Econ- and Eco- are the sound-alike prefixes scholars and politicians love to affix to their new millennium pronouncements.
Broadly, the two are set against each other. They're the perceived bookends of mankind's future. Economic growth (read improved living standards) supposedly causes ecologic decline (read hotter, less green, fewer species). Conversely, eco-preservation means econo- decline. Pop wisdom says you can have one or the other, not both.
We refuse to buy that equation.
This subject snaps into focus at the moment, not because of millennium chatter but because of three global events that demand more than usual attention:
1. The hottest summer month on record plus other climate anomalies.
2. Asian slump II. Spreading concern that Asia's slowdown is, after all, going to affect people and businesses everywhere.
3. The giant BP-Amoco oil company merger, and what it says about future fuel supplies, costs, greenhouse gases, and green energy alternatives.
The three, taken together, constitute a powerful argument for the mouth-full concept of "sustainable development." Those readers already well versed in what this means may skip a paragraph.
Sustainable development broadly describes an array of steps that would allow billions of hungry, resource-poor, shelter-deprived, education-poor, overworked or unemployed people to gain an acceptable standard of living through economic growth, while still preserving our planet's ecosystems in a self-sustaining balance.
In practical terms this means redesigning thousands of industrial processes to make them pollution reduced, if not pollution-free. It means designing transport (cars, motorcycles, tractors) whose exhaust is cleaner than their air intake. Ditto, heating and cooling. Ditto, chlorine-compound insecticides, herbicides, and household products.
Skeptics base their scenario of inevitable econ-eco collision on what they see as either (1) the technical impossibility of, or (2) the lack of human focus on, achieving sustainable development. We said we refuse to buy that skepticism. We do so because we have faith in mankind's ability to solve problems once fully alerted to them.
The hottest summer weather since the advent of record keeping and the spread of Asia's slump constitute a vigorous alert. BP's giant leap in influence on petroleum exploration and use is an interesting move on the sustainability front.
BP's CEO, Sir John Browne, made a splash two years ago when he announced at his alma mater, Stanford, that he was pushing his firm to do a billion dollars worth of business in solar energy devices by 2000. He continues to parley with Greenpeace and other environmental organizations in an effort to find common ground on sustainable, environmentally sound growth. And he's not the only captain of industry seeking to profit from shifting world industry to sustainable processes - in cooperation with governments, universities, and groups espousing both the environment and human betterment in food, housing, and work conditions.
Let's be blunt and realistic. Such sustainable development and better living standards will need petroleum and the steel, plastics, power, fertilizer, and the other output oil supports into the foreseeable future. But the uses to which such fossil fuels are put will have to be cleaned up as noted above. That means far greater efficiency of manufacturing, heat/cooling, transport, so as to curb toxic output and steadily reduce greenhouse gas buildup. It also means more urgency on shifting to alternative energy technology.
Is this hot-tin-roof summer certifiable evidence of global climate change? Not definitively. But growing more likely. Obviously climate records dating only from 1870 tell us little. But deep glacier samples, ancient tree rings, suboceanic core samples and other evidence warrant caution. And that caution should take the form of a sensible global insurance policy.
If we assume, as economic logic urges, that the Asian-slump spread is temporary and that the desire for a better life throughout the developing world persists, we must prepare for renewed worldwide growth.
That, surely, is a goad to speeding research on sustainable processes in every area of manufacturing, transport, construction, and general energy use. It surely is a goad, also, to leaders of industry, environmental groups, politicians, universities, and developing nations' human rights advocates to work cooperatively in the fashion gingerly explored by BP's Browne and Greenpeace's Lord Peter Melchett.
Many such leaders are already quietly engaged in cooperation based on research and global realities. That, not the political cliche, is the true bridge to the 21st century.
Growth, better standards of living, and an ecologically stable planet require rivals to cooperate.

Economic growth (read improved living standards) supposedly causes ecologic decline (read hotter, less green, fewer species). Conversely, eco-preservation means econo- decline. Pop wisdom says you can have one or the other, not both.
We refuse to buy that equation.
This subject snaps into focus at the moment, not because of millennium chatter but because of three global events that demand more than usual attention:
1. The hottest summer month on record plus other climate anomalies.
2. Asian slump II. Spreading concern that Asia's slowdown is, after all, going to affect people and businesses everywhere.
3. The giant BP-Amoco oil company merger, and what it says about future fuel supplies, costs, greenhouse gases, and green energy alternatives.
The three, taken together, constitute a powerful argument for the mouth-full concept of "sustainable development." Those readers already well versed in what this means may skip a paragraph.
Sustainable development broadly describes an array of steps that would allow billions of hungry, resource-poor, shelter-deprived, education-poor, overworked or unemployed people to gain an acceptable standard of living through economic growth, while still preserving our planet's ecosystems in a self-sustaining balance.
In practical terms this means redesigning thousands of industrial processes to make them pollution reduced, if not pollution-free. It means designing transport (cars, motorcycles, tractors) whose exhaust is cleaner than their air intake. Ditto, heating and cooling. Ditto, chlorine-compound insecticides, herbicides, and household products.
Skeptics base their scenario of inevitable econ-eco collision on what they see as either (1) the technical impossibility of, or (2) the lack of human focus on, achieving sustainable development. We said we refuse to buy that skepticism. We do so because we have faith in mankind's ability to solve problems once fully alerted to them.
The hottest summer weather since the advent of record keeping and the spread of Asia's slump constitute a vigorous alert. BP's giant leap in influence on petroleum exploration and use is an interesting move on the sustainability front.
BP's CEO, Sir John Browne, made a splash two years ago when he announced at his alma mater, Stanford, that he was pushing his firm to do a billion dollars worth of business in solar energy devices by 2000. He continues to parley with Greenpeace and other environmental organizations in an effort to find common ground on sustainable, environmentally sound growth. And he's not the only captain of industry seeking to profit from shifting world industry to sustainable processes - in cooperation with governments, universities, and groups espousing both the environment and human betterment in food, housing, and work conditions.
Let's be blunt and realistic. Such sustainable development and better living standards will need petroleum and the steel, plastics, power, fertilizer, and the other output oil supports into the foreseeable future. But the uses to which such fossil fuels are put will have to be cleaned up as noted above. That means far greater efficiency of manufacturing, heat/cooling, transport, so as to curb toxic output and steadily reduce greenhouse gas buildup. It also means more urgency on shifting to alternative energy technology.
Is this hot-tin-roof summer certifiable evidence of global climate change? Not definitively. But growing more likely. Obviously climate records dating only from 1870 tell us little. But deep glacier samples, ancient tree rings, suboceanic core samples and other evidence warrant caution. And that caution should take the form of a sensible global insurance policy.
If we assume, as economic logic urges, that the Asian-slump spread is temporary and that the desire for a better life throughout the developing world persists, we must prepare for renewed worldwide growth.
That, surely, is a goad to speeding research on sustainable processes in every area of manufacturing, transport, construction, and general energy use. It surely is a goad, also, to leaders of industry, environmental groups, politicians, universities, and developing nations' human rights advocates to work cooperatively in the fashion gingerly explored by BP's Browne and Greenpeace's Lord Peter Melchett.
Many such leaders are already quietly engaged in cooperation based on research and global realities. That, not the political cliche, is the true bridge to the 21st century.
Growth, better standards of living, and an ecologically stable planet require rivals to cooperate.

Abstract: When a Kettering woman went to the lavatory last month, she got a surprise. Just as she sat down, she heard a scratching and scrabbling beneath her. Alarmed, she found that a rat had negotiated the U-bend and was trying to climb out of the toilet bowl. Nor does her experience represent an isolated case of Rattus norvegicus, the common brown rat, making a dash from the sewers. A national survey of local authorities, published today, reports rat populations exploding across the country with increased risks to human health as they reach the surface. The culprits, says the Robens Centre for Public and Environmetal Health, are privatised water companies and local authorities that are neglecting to repair the crumbling sewerage systems which house almost all Britain's estimated 60 million rats.

Full text: WHEN a Kettering woman went to the lavatory last month, she got a surprise. Just as she sat down, she heard a scratching and scrabbling beneath her. Alarmed, she found that a rat had negotiated the U-bend and was trying to climb out of the toilet bowl.
Nor does her experience represent an isolated case of Rattus norvegicus, the common brown rat, making a dash from the sewers. A national survey of local authorities, published today, reports rat populations exploding across the country with increased risks to human health as they reach the surface.
The culprits, says the Robens Centre for Public and Environmetal Health, are privatised water companies and local authorities that are neglecting to repair the crumbling sewerage systems which house almost all Britain's estimated 60 million rats.
As cracks appear in the underground drainage systems, so the rats are coming out.
The study of more than 160 local authorities suggests that there have been 40,000 reported cases of rats in homes in the past three years. Real numbers could be far higher. Government research of places known to be infested suggests that only 40 per cent of people make official complaints.
Almost half the councils surveyed said that rat populations were now increasing considerably. This follows a Ministry of Agriculture report in 1993 that showed that rat populations had leapt by 40 per cent since the late 1970s.
The problem may be greater than anyone thouht with more than 300,000 kilometres of public sewerage system network and a similar length of private pipes going uninspected.
But Britain's sewers are now being dangerously neglected, says the report's author, environmental health consultant Stephen Battersby, who is accepted as one of Britain's authorities on vermin.
Few local authorities have sewerage maintenance agreements since the privatisation of the water companies. Some do not lay bait to control rats and only 8 per cent have revised their pest control strategies in the past two years, Mr Battersby says.
The water companies reply that they spend more than pounds 2 million a year dealing with rats.
Mr Battersby called on the Government to make water companies and local authorities take the threat to public health seriously and act now. The Government has no plans either to issue guidelines or review the laws, some dating back 50 years. But yesterday an official of the Department of the Environment said it planned to meet Mr Battersby to discuss his report.
Mr Battersby said: "We are seeing the beginnings of the disintegration of the sewerage system as a direct consequence of the situation being ignored for so long by everyone, from the Government down."
Rats flourish when they are out of the sewers, where they have little food, the report says. One pair can produce a colony of 2,000 rats in a year. Local authorities list climate change, more fast food outlets, and excessive litter as contributory factors to the rat population explosion.
The phenomenon is not just British. These are good times for rats around the world with uncontrolled expansion of cities, overflowing rubbish dumps, and a decline of public services following privatisation everywhere.
Rattus norvegicus carries foot and mouth disease, tuberculosis, rat-bite fever and cryptosporidium, among other diseases.
Joan Whalley, the Labour MP who chairs the Campaign for the Renewal of Older Sewerage Systems, has written to John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, about the problem. She called yesterday for a government summit to address the public health issues posed by rats. "We face a desperate situation and have to take action now."
Rat facts
Rats live for about 18 months and breed three months from birth. One pair can produce a colony of 2,000 in a year. It would be impossible to eradicate them completely.
They can climb brickwork and guttering, swim along pipes, climb U bends in toilets and get into cavity walls.
US rats are thought to cause $10 billion damage a year. They can undermine foundations, chew through electric cabling and cause fires, destroy telecommunications junction boxes. British insurance companies usually exclude damage by vermin from policies.
Rats are expected to flourish in the next 10 years. Old Victorian sewerage systems are near the end of their lifespan and new sewers and drains are often in very poor condition. At the present rate of repair, some sewers will have to last more than 500 years before they are replaced.

U.S. Climate Center Sees Heat Records Break, A Trend That Has Multibillion-Dollar Effects

Abstract: Because climatology is still more of an art than a science, the numbers aren't always tidy. But satellites give the analysts here, once confined to a network of 11,000 mostly volunteer weather observers in the U.S., the ability to scan the world. Their collection of weather data -- the world's largest -- allows them to "back-forecast" what the weather might have been in the year 1400. And their supercomputers generate models showing what future weather may be. Reports of raging wildfires in Florida, severe drought in Texas and epic floods in California all find a place here, because these are the people who declare new records and redefine what "normal" weather patterns are. Increasingly, that information has multibillion-dollar consequences for business, because it will soon show up in changed government weather norms used for building codes, highway construction, the utility industry, flood insurance and the nation's protective levees and dams. To be sure, global warming, and its suggestions of still more violent weather to come, has its skeptics. One of them used to be Mr. (Tom) Karl, who believed that some temperatures were being skewed upward by "urban heat sinks," or rapidly growing cities whose masonry and pavement tend to store heat. The theory fizzled. "It accounted for only a small percentage of the warming that is going on," he explains.

Full text: ASHEVILLE, N.C. -- It's summertime and the living here, in the cool of the Great Smoky Mountains, is easy. But not at the U.S. National Climatic Data Center, where experts are sweating over multiple records showing this may be the planet's hottest summer in 600 years.
Because climatology is still more of an art than a science, the numbers aren't always tidy. But satellites give the analysts here, once confined to a network of 11,000 mostly volunteer weather observers in the U.S., the ability to scan the world. Their collection of weather data -- the world's largest -- allows them to "back-forecast" what the weather might have been in the year 1400. And their supercomputers generate models showing what future weather may be.
Reports of raging wildfires in Florida, severe drought in Texas and epic floods in California all find a place here, because these are the people who declare new records and redefine what "normal" weather patterns are. Increasingly, that information has multibillion-dollar consequences for business, because it will soon show up in changed government weather norms used for building codes, highway construction, the utility industry, flood insurance and the nation's protective levees and dams.
"This is a pretty exciting time," says Tom Karl, a climatologist who directs the center. Lately he has been summoned to the White House on a monthly basis to help Vice President Al Gore explain what each new record means. He was on hand this week when Mr. Gore announced that July was the globe's hottest month on record.
To be sure, global warming, and its suggestions of still more violent weather to come, has its skeptics. One of them used to be Mr. Karl, who believed that some temperatures were being skewed upward by "urban heat sinks," or rapidly growing cities whose masonry and pavement tend to store heat. The theory fizzled. "It accounted for only a small percentage of the warming that is going on," he explains.
One who is still a skeptic is John Christy, from the University of Alabama in Huntsville. He sought to debunk global warming because 19 years of satellite data he monitors showed that lower levels of the earth's atmosphere were cooling slightly. This year, though, his data turned on him. "January through now is the hottest data we've ever seen," he says.
He still dismisses many of the U.S. weather disturbances as mere "regional variations," but his numbers show the globe's tropics are steaming, generating enough heat to slightly raise the earth's average temperature. What does it all mean? "It means we've improved our level of ignorance about the climate system," he says.
Robert Quayle, who heads the global climate laboratory here, found himself doubting a graph produced by the center that showed the average temperature of the planet's oceans had jumped half a degree. "I thought maybe our instruments were wrong," recalls Mr. Quayle. So he called officials in the United Kingdom, which runs a separate measurement system, and found they measured the oceans even warmer.
"This is pretty striking. Sea temperatures are pretty conservative sorts of things. They don't change rapidly like air temperatures do," he explains. While many weather forecasters blame much of the current heat wave on El Nino, a massive periodic warming effect in the Pacific Ocean, Mr. Quayle and other climatologists suspect something more fundamental is going on.
Lately officials here have been meeting with bankers, traders and insurance managers who are also concerned about what has been happening. To them, warming means money, because record-breaking weather will change the 30-year weather patterns that the center uses to define "normal" weather.
Climatologists say warming puts more water into the atmosphere, which, in turn, means record rainfall and more violent storms. That means insurance rates go up and that the definition of flood-prone areas, normally measured by record floods over a period of 100 years, will have to be enlarged. "These questions go to whether you can get a bank mortgage or not, or how high to build a bridge. It will change standards for heating and cooling systems in building codes," Mr. Quayle says.
The questions have also kicked off a new political tempest in Washington, where Ben McNitt, co-author of a study by the National Wildlife Federation, asserts that the Federal Emergency Management Agency's 100-year flood maps "are not accurate in a large number of cases." He also says the Army Corps of Engineers, which builds dams and levees, is working with out-of-date information. "We found no sense of awareness within the middle management of these agencies that climate change was relevant to their day-to-day operations," Mr. McNitt asserts.
Michael Armstrong, an associate director of FEMA, which has spent over $1 billion over the past 30 years developing 100-year flood maps for communities, concedes some of them are at least 10 years old. "Everyone will acknowledge here that we need to do some more work in this area," he adds, referring to the maps. He blames the lagging at FEMA on "inadequate funding."
As for the Army Corps of Engineers, Eugene Stakhiv, a chief planner there, says: "Look, the corps is not just sitting here being fat, dumb and happy." The corps is studying the impact of climate change on the upper Mississippi and trying to decipher conflicting computer models projecting the effects of global warming. "What they could criticize us for," Mr. Stakhiv offers, "is that it takes a long time to do this, and we are not well-coordinated with FEMA."
While many people see trouble in the climatologists' reports, some see opportunity. "We've been studying the measurement of weather very extensively," says one of the center's more frequent visitors, Tripp Dunman, portfolio manager for Aquila Energy, a subsidiary of UtiliCorp United Inc., a utility in Kansas City, Mo. Aquila's interest in the area was stimulated by losses the parent company sustained when it bought too much fuel to prepare for what turned out to be a warmish winter.
So Aquila came up with a trading instrument, a "weather derivative," that allows utilities and other companies to hedge against the prospect of an abnormal winter. If a company pays it a certain premium, Aquila will pay it a specified amount for each degree above or below what the center determines is normal weather. "It's different than an insurance policy. There are no disputes, no claims procedures," Mr. Dunman says.
Is this risky business? Not necessarily, insists Jack D. Cogen, president of Natsource Corp., a New York firm that also trades in weather derivatives. The trick is to spread out the risks, he says, pointing to a deal last winter when Natsource had a Midwest utility wanting to hedge against a warm winter and a Chicago builder that wanted protection against work stoppages caused by an unusually cold winter. "Everybody won," he says.

Letters Matthews oversteps bounds in expressing moral outrage

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/letters-matthews-oversteps-bounds-expressing/docview/412706265/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: The Editors: Richard Matthews' July 30 column ("Where is this country's sense of shame?") begs for a response. I, too, would hope that the people of our country will be outraged by moral decadence, but I remember a time when the accused were presumed innocent. One may have an opinion that "credible accusations" are sufficient to demand that the president resign, but to be morally outraged when the American people do not concur is sheer arrogance. The American people have made a decision that until there is absolute evidence to the contrary, [President] Clinton, whom they twice elected, should be presumed innocent. Matthews is not entitled to decide for me that the accusations are credible. Anyone can make accusations, but neither their existence nor their number alone is sufficient to condemn. The president's detractors presume him guilty. His supporters, including those who have enjoyed six years of prosperity, cling to the hope that he is not. If his guilt is conclusively proven, I, too, will expect him to resign. Until then, he has my support and my prayers. The Editors: Once again, the newspaper printed an article on the depleted uranium used in the Gulf War and did not use the words "radioactive waste" ("Uranium exposure: Gulf war vets claim health issues ignored," National News, Tuesday). Radioactive waste is what depleted uranium is. Radioactive waste always carries the threat of cancer, birth defects, leukemia and immune system damage, but unless it is called by its correct name and carries appropriate warning, the public will be at risk.

JAMES H. MEEK, Tucker
Bringing us down
The Editors: Like most people, my family and I are suffering from an information overload brought on by the never-ending accounts of the "Oval Office Follies." Frankly, we are not surprised by President Clinton's actions. From his earliest appearance in big-time politics, he has exemplified the image of the somewhat smarmy politician who will say anything and do anything to raise money or to get elected.
What is dismaying is the attitude of the public when confronted with Clinton's shenanigans. We have become a society that confuses celebrity with heroics. We idolize athletes and celebrities, regardless of their morality or behavior. When the presidency becomes the subject of ridicule and salacious jokes, we all are diminished. ROBERT T. CROSBY, Dunwoody
A genuine threat
The Editors: Once again, the newspaper printed an article on the depleted uranium used in the Gulf War and did not use the words "radioactive waste" ("Uranium exposure: Gulf war vets claim health issues ignored," National News, Tuesday). Radioactive waste is what depleted uranium is. Radioactive waste always carries the threat of cancer, birth defects, leukemia and immune system damage, but unless it is called by its correct name and carries appropriate warning, the public will be at risk.
Radioactive waste is the great unsolved problem, not because it is worse than climate change and toxic pollution, but because it will last for centuries. Human technology has no way to reverse the process of radioactive decay created in a nuclear reactor.
JOAN O. KING, Sautee
No comparison
The Editors: Pentagon spokesperson Dian Lawhon compared exposure to depleted uranium with children's exposure to lead by licking the ends of their pencils ("Gulf war vets claim health issues ignored"). Pencil "lead" is composed of graphite, which is elemental carbon bound in hexagonal sheets, mixed with clay or other substances to change its hardness.
Perhaps the Pentagon should spend some of my tax dollars on a refresher chemistry course for its personnel. ANDREW J. LAMPKIN III, College Park
Keep the change
The Editors: The new gold-colored dollar will be the size of a quarter, and the point of interest is the design on its face? As was noted in a Journal news article, ("New coin inspired by Sacajawea," July 30) the problem with the Susan B. Anthony coin was not that people disliked the color, or Anthony, but that it was the size of a quarter. People want to feel a dollar's worth in a dollar coin, not a quarter's worth. Want to hear a prediction concerning the public's acceptance of the new dollar coin?

A busy month
The Editors: In a story headlined "Lawmaker breaks ranks with GOP" (National News, Wednesday) a reporter asserted that House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.)has had "precious little" to say in public recently and has only granted interviews to a select few Capitol Hill publications. The speaker did cancel some public events after the tragic shooting deaths of two Capitol police officers, but in the two preceding weeks, he took part in nearly a dozen major news conferences, gave another half-dozen speeches, and conducted more than 20 interviews.
The story also claimed that Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) and the speaker "are meeting resistance" in securing contributions from other Republicans to a national issue advocacy campaign. The campaign has raised more than $6 million in its first two weeks alone.
Finally, in citing health-care legislation as the GOP's "one big success" in the past month, the reporter ignored (among other accomplishments) IRS reform, the Coverdell education savings accounts, the partial-birth abortion veto override, emergency aid for America's farmers, and automatic mortgage insurance cancellation.

Abstract: While the premiers often end their annual conference by making numerous demands on Ottawa, they reduced their demands this year -- deferring a call for a national transportation strategy -- in the hope that their health care demands won't be diluted by other requests. In B.C., the federal transfer cuts will mean a loss of $625 million this year. When the cuts between 1995 and 1997 are added, the B.C. cuts total nearly $1.8 billion. Because the money is transferred in a lump sum, it is difficult to determine how much specifically has been cut from health. "From a global warming perspective and from an air quality perspective, the last thing we need in almost all instances is more highways," he said in an interview from Saskatoon, where he was lobbying the premiers to discuss a strategy to reduce greenhouse gases.

Full text: SASKATOON - Canada's premiers demanded a cut in payroll taxes and a $6-billion increase in health care spending Friday in an effort to create jobs, improve medicare and increase investor confidence in Canada.
Wrapping up their 39th annual conference on the picturesque banks of the South Saskatchewan River, the provincial leaders said improved health care is the top priority for Canadians from coast to coast.
"This is our first priority," said Ontario Premier Mike Harris calling on the federal government to restore the $6 billion a year that has been cut from health care. "That could all be done by next budget year."
In an effort to spark the economy and boost jobs - particularly for young people - the premiers also called on Ottawa to cut Employment Insurance premiums paid by employers and workers.
By reducing EI premiums, and eliminating them for young people, the premiers say 200,000 new jobs could be created, one quarter of them for youth.
By the end of 1998, the EI fund is expected to show a $19 billion surplus.
"I think it's unconscionable that there is a large surplus there," B.C. Premier Glen Clark said. "That's a payroll tax. There should be either enhanced benefits or cuts in the payroll tax."
While the premiers often end their annual conference by making numerous demands on Ottawa, they reduced their demands this year -- deferring a call for a national transportation strategy -- in the hope that their health care demands won't be diluted by other requests.
"The priority has to be health care," Clark said. "That's got to be the message to Canadians. We're deferring any talks or requests for a national highways program until we get the health care situation resolved."
In B.C., the federal transfer cuts will mean a loss of $625 million this year. When the cuts between 1995 and 1997 are added, the B.C. cuts total nearly $1.8 billion. Because the money is transferred in a lump sum, it is difficult to determine how much specifically has been cut from health.
"They should restore it all," Clark said.
The deferred transportation plan was greeted as a minor victory by Gerry Scott, who heads the climate change program at Vancouver's David Suzuki Foundation.
"From a global warming perspective and from an air quality perspective, the last thing we need in almost all instances is more highways," he said in an interview from Saskatoon, where he was lobbying the premiers to discuss a strategy to reduce greenhouse gases.
"We would like to see the national government and all the provinces move forward on reduction strategies. For years there's been talk and study on global warming . . .It's time for every level of government and industry in this country to move forward in a serious way."
But Scott left disappointed, when the premiers failed to address the issue.

Abstract: One hundred percent of the children buried in St. Mary's Cemetery didn't hurt anyone, were a joy to their families, were taken away too soon, and have since been forgotten by the public at large. I personally know the families of two children who were killed on the streets of Buffalo Grove, one of whom was taken following a Buffalo Grove Days Parade. For years, I gladly volunteered for what was called the "Race for Nicole" at my parish. I don't know anyone who passes the reservoir area without remembering that a young life was lost there. But enough is enough about a memorial for Nicole Soccorso, and that is so sad for Nicole. Her name no longer instills a sadness in people's hearts, but rather stirs up controversy and resentment. Her family needs to let go of Nicole and accept that she is now in a better place, that her suffering was somehow God's will that only strong faith can explain. Anyone who visits her grave at St. Mary's can attest to the fact that the family is missing the big picture. It's time they move on and live as Nicole would want them to. If the world memorialized every death, there wouldn't be any time to live. Predictions of economic doom-and-gloom are mostly bellowing from the fossil fuel industry, and their converts in Congress and on talk radio. How else to interpret the op-ed pages and commentaries claiming that action to curb climate change will break the bank? However, a new report by the Union of Concerned Scientists reveals that these claims are pure fiction. UCS surveyed the most widely respected studies from the past 10 years to determine what cost, if any, the U.S. might pay for tackling global warming. The report looked at independent analyses from the U.S. government's national energy laboratories, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Office of Technology Assessment, and private energy research organizations. A much more encouraging force emerged.

One hundred percent of the children buried in St. Mary's Cemetery didn't hurt anyone, were a joy to their families, were taken away too soon, and have since been forgotten by the public at large. I personally know the families of two children who were killed on the streets of Buffalo Grove, one of whom was taken following a Buffalo Grove Days Parade. For years, I gladly volunteered for what was called the "Race for Nicole" at my parish. I don't know anyone who passes the reservoir area without remembering that a young life was lost there.

Anyone who visits her grave at St. Mary's can attest to the fact that the family is missing the big picture. It's time they move on and live as Nicole would want them to. If the world memorialized every death, there wouldn't be any time to live.
It was upsetting to learn that a group of mothers from Arlington Heights is banding together to push for a memorial at the park. If they succeed, it would be an insult to all the children who have died an accidental death. Though their intentions are indeed inspiring, this was an unfortunate accident caused by vandalism, however terrible it was.
Death should be shared among those who really knew the person, grief should be shared among those who really loved the person, and memories should be shared among those who were fortunate enough to have been loved by the person.
Angels have no need to be preserved in memorials.

Prevent global warming
Since the international climate change negotiations in Kyoto, Japan last December, many conservative politicians and pundits have developed a suspiciously consistent mantra: "Oil and coal, good. Global warming treaty, bad." Cynical and misinformed local media outlets have added "Don't worry, be happy" to the chant.
The treaty opponents are quite willing to twist the facts about global warming to "spin" their own political agenda. The narrow assumptions underlying their Business As Usual recommendations overlook emerging technologies, the strength of the American business community to use change as an advantage, and the consequences of being wrong.
Predictions of economic doom-and-gloom are mostly bellowing from the fossil fuel industry, and their converts in Congress and on talk radio. How else to interpret the op-ed pages and commentaries claiming that action to curb climate change will break the bank? However, a new report by the Union of Concerned Scientists reveals that these claims are pure fiction. UCS surveyed the most widely respected studies from the past 10 years to determine what cost, if any, the U.S. might pay for tackling global warming. The report looked at independent analyses from the U.S. government's national energy laboratories, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Office of Technology Assessment, and private energy research organizations. A much more encouraging force emerged.
The Kyoto climate treaty calls for U.S. emissions of heat-trapping gases to be cut by only 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. These studies show that the U.S. has great technological potential for significantly reducing emissions of carbon dioxide - the most critical global warming gas. In many cases, the resulting economic savings, in terms of reduced energy bills, would outweigh the cost of implementing the measures needed to tap this potential. Moreover, the same measures that would cut these emissions would also improve local air quality by reducing releases of dangerous air pollutants, a key consideration in the Chicagoland region.
To meet the treaty's goals, the United States needs to give priority to policies and measures that encourage more efficient energy use and a more rapid shift to cleaner, renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power. The alarmist economic predictions ignore the potential contribution of these clean technologies and assume that the only ways to reduce emissions are through costly and shortsighted means that actually would slow economic growth. By contrast, well-chosen policies and measures can overcome the market barriers that hinder widespread commercialization of these advanced and clean technologies, as well as stimulate further technological innovation.
Opponents of action also ignore the potentially enormous economic costs of global warming. Climate change could cause many social, demographic and political disruptions. The costs of some of these would be characterized by this summer's fires, floods and heat waves: sea level rise and coastal flooding; more intense rainfall, floods and droughts. Others are sometimes more difficult to quantify economically: accelerating loss of ecologically important species. Human health could be threatened not only by more frequent heat waves, but by spread of tropical diseases to Illinois latitudes.
There is an overwhelming consensus among the world's climate scientists that these threats are real and require immediate action. If the U.S. does not act, Americans could lose out on the rapidly expanding international market for advanced energy technologies. We'd be left to face the harsh impacts of a warmer, less stable climate.
Our political and business leaders must see through the doom and gloom rhetoric of do-nothing advocates, and scrutinize the billions of federal dollars going annually to subsidize the fossil fuel industry. In contrast, the Kyoto climate treaty is a very cheap insurance policy against the substantial risks of global warming. Future generations deserve no less than this small price of protection.

Open space costs less
There were only a few surprises at the monthly Libertyville Township Board meeting July 16. Jack Martin and his sidekick, Pat Connors, were there in their usual role, threatening a lawsuit if the town board didn't do their bidding, and in the same breath implying their only motivation was to protect the taxpayers. There were a few present who were afraid they will be driven out of their homes by high taxes. That may be, but not because of Open Space - but because of development and the need to provide for new schools, libraries and roads.
Thus the purpose of this letter to the editor. Down through history, the rich and powerful have used their money and position to promote their own self-serving agendas, and all too often they have succeeded. The only method the masses ever had was to band together, and equally important, to stick together, to ensure they got a fair shake.
So it is with the threatened lawsuit by Martin and Connors to stop the Open Space program once again. They used the same tactics in 1989, and were highly successful in those efforts to deceive the public, and to cause the change of political leadership both at the township and county level. Most people know now the costly results of that change in direction.
The issues are over-development, traffic congestion, and more schools, which always mean higher taxes. More Open Space always means stabilized taxes and greatly improved property values and quality of life. The question the public must answer: Is it worth fighting for? The public will pay either way, but overdevelopment will cost several times more.

Violating right to choose
Recently the House of Representatives voted 223-202 to prohibit the FDA from testing, developing or approving a drug that would chemically induce an abortion, including RU-486 (Mifepristone). A woman's health-care provider administers RU-486, and it is used to safely terminate a pregnancy up to nine weeks. This drug has been used in Europe since 1981 as a safe and effective alternative to surgical abortion procedures. So why are American women being denied this option? The answer is simple.
As the 1998 elections approach, conservative lawmakers need to ensure the support of social conservatives. What better way to do that than to attack a woman's right to choose and further assault a woman's right to choose her own reproductive options.
In seeking to ban the FDA from approving medical abortion drugs, anti-choice lawmakers are subjecting the already rigorous drug- approval process to a highly political screen. They also are setting a dangerous precedent whereby scientific advancement must first pass political muster to move forward.
Abortion is legal in this country, and a woman has a constitutional right to choose. The Coburn amendment effectively bans a highly effective method of early pregnancy termination and is therefore unconstitutional. Congress should spend more time developing programs that address the causes of unintended pregnancy and thus reduce the need for abortion than on pandering to the wishes of a socially conservative minority.

Grow up, Granger
Mr. Granger:
It's understandable when an adolescent has to "act cool," bolstering his/her insecurity by mocking the rules and making fun of those who try to abide by the rules.
It's pitiful and ridiculous when an adult has to "act cool" by aligning with a recognized cool person. I read your article this morning and thought, "Grow up!" (Please, no articles on accepting the child in ourselves!)
We all know that people of outstanding ability or looks can and do get away with breaking the rules. Sometimes they break the rules in an amusing way. While I do not "delight" in Rodman's antics, neither do they disturb me; I see his charm sometimes; I was amused with him when he smiled in amazement at his free throws. But Rodman is no different drummer in the deeper sense. It takes great courage to really stand up against what is popular. I spent my career teaching high school students, and I can tell you that the true different drummer is the kid who has the guts to follow the rules - not out of fear, but out of principle. That kid usually suffers. Rodman is certainly being true to himself, but his actions are easy - what's a couple thousand in fines? He's a celebrity!
What depressed me most about your article was not your defense of Rodman, but your nasty attack on Jerry Sloan, and by implication, his team of "uncool" types. You mock Sloan and all who abide by the rules, stereotyping them as uptight, intolerant, out of it, while people like you and your son are open-minded and with it.
Rodman should be insulted by your condescending remarks. You and your son would never dress like him, but you both "delight" in his "antics."
A few, rare people of exceptional talent have the humility to try to live by the rules.

Congrats on 60 years
I was fortunate enough to recently attend a luncheon to celebrate Robert Y. Paddock's 60th anniversary with Paddock Publications. At this event were gathered representatives from the Boy Scouts, the Rotary, the Clearbrook Center, the village of Arlington Heights, High School District 214 Education Foundation, the Arlington Heights Central Business District, the Northwest Community Hospital Foundation and myself, representing the American Red Cross. All of these organizations have benefited from the generous efforts of Mr. Paddock over the years, and we were all there to show our deepest gratitude and congratulate Mr. Paddock on his anniversary.
Following the luncheon, a reception was held at the Daily Herald building, where Mr. Paddock was greeted by a rousing round of applause from the staff of the Daily Herald. He also was presented a plaque of recognition from Mayor Arlene Mulder of Arlington Heights, recognizing his outstanding work in the community.
As for the American Red Cross, we just wanted to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Paddock for his generous contributions to our organization. Once a year, over a period of several years, Mr. Paddock would swim one mile, and collect pledges from his colleagues around the community based on how far he swam. In that period of time, Mr. Paddock raised approximately $50,000 to help the American Red Cross meet its mission, to help people prevent, prepare for and respond to emergencies.
Mr. Paddock, congratulations on your anniversary with Paddock Publications. We hope you have many more happy and healthy years with the company. Your work with Paddock Publications and your community should be a model for us all to follow.

Regulating greenhouse gas emissions can't wait for argument to be solved, minister tells critics
Wednesday, July 15, 1998
Alberta Bureau
Calgary -- Canada's Natural Resources Minister struck back yesterday at oil-industry criticisms of Ottawa's acceptance that global warming exists, saying the skeptics are wrong to dismiss the effect of greenhouse gases on the planet's climate.
Ralph Goodale said he refuses to be "paralyzed by analysis," and urged the nay-sayers to stop complaining and start supporting the federal government's plan to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
"If the world waits for absolute scientific certainty, then the world will have waited too long," Mr. Goodale said after meeting with provincial energy ministers.
"The preponderance of international scientific opinion very clearly suggests that greenhouse gases are having an effect on the climate. If unchecked, those gases will lead to very serious consequences for the environment."
Many of Canada's major energy companies oppose Ottawa's goal of cutting emissions by 2012 to levels 6 per cent below those recorded in 1990. Among the most vocal critics are Imperial Oil Ltd., Talisman Energy Inc., Alberta Energy Co. Ltd. and Ipsco Inc.
Mr. Goodale said the federal government will press ahead with its emissions-reduction strategy but it won't be easy to win over those who question the science of climate change.
At the Kyoto conference on global warming last December, Ottawa agreed to set new emissions targets, promising to begin implementing its plan by early 2000.
Mr. Goodale acknowledged that some dissenting scientists have argued vigorously that there are huge flaws in studies that indicate greenhouse-gas emissions create excessive global warming and hurt the environment.
"This is a big issue. The solutions will not be simple. But this is a time to be pro-active. You cannot buy the insurance coverage you should have had after the fact."
Besides trying to get oil and gas companies to co-operate, Ottawa realizes that it also must persuade energy-producing provinces, especially Alberta and Saskatchewan, to back plans to reduce emissions, Mr. Goodale said.
Alberta Energy Minister Steve West declined to enter the debate over the science of global warming, but he said the Kyoto pledge won't be ratified by Alberta unless Ottawa lowers its targets.
"We have polluted over the years . . . but we're asking the federal government for maximum flexibility and further discussion," Mr. West said.
Saskatchewan Energy Minister Eldon Lautermilch said that although Ottawa has the power to move unilaterally, the reality is that provincial support will be needed to carry out the federal proposals.
David Manning, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said it's time for the oil patch to work more closely with Ottawa, even though some of his member companies are expressing basic doubts about global warming.
However, Mr. Manning said he's worried about the potentially harmful economic impact of limiting greenhouse gases.
He said a recent survey commissioned by the association indicated that of 2,000 Canadians polled, environmental issues such as water pollution and toxic waste easily emerged as more worrisome problems than climate change.

Bill Clinton's week light on scandal: [SOUTH PINELLAS Edition]

Author: Dahl, David

Abstract: President Clinton's week started with a baby boomer's lament on the passing of Roy Rogers. It began to wind down with a high-roller dinner at the garish Miami home of Sylvester Stallone. As witnesses parade in and out of the federal courthouse here, Clinton has remained focused on what he repeatedly says is the job the American people hired him to do. The strategy seems to fit perfectly with the waning public interest in the never-ending Kenneth Starr investigation of Clinton. By offering no further explanation for his conduct in months, Clinton has avoided fueling the story that once threatened to engulf him.

Full text: President Clinton's week started with a baby boomer's lament on the passing of Roy Rogers. It began to wind down with a high-roller dinner at the garish Miami home of Sylvester Stallone.
Along the way, he debated race relations on public television and announced plans to educate the poor about Medicareand to travel to Russia. He raised money for Democrats, praised firefighters in Florida, launched an anti-drug advertising campaign and delivered the medal of honor to a Vietnam War hero from Jacksonville.
Did someone say Monica Lewinsky? Not the president.
As witnesses parade in and out of the federal courthouse here, Clinton has remained focused on what he repeatedly says is the job the American people hired him to do. The strategy seems to fit perfectly with the waning public interest in the never-ending Kenneth Starr investigation of Clinton. By offering no further explanation for his conduct in months, Clinton has avoided fueling the story that once threatened to engulf him.
Six months after the scandal broke, this much is true: The predictions of Clinton's political demise appear much exaggerated.
He remains the top draw for Democrats in their latest quest for campaign cash, and is his party's chief spokesman in drawing the battle lines for this year's congressional races.
Just off his successful trip to China, he jumped back into a week of media events and announcements, often in Ronald Reagan-style settings that tap into Americans' pride and the country's satisfaction with its economic success and swelled mutual funds.
No wonder, then, that Stallone delivered a pair of red boxing gloves to the president at a fund-raiser Thursday night.
"I can use them," Clinton said. "I think I have established that I can take a punch. Now the time has come for me to deliver a few."
Consider these scenes from last week's White House script:
Monday: the Rose Garden
Under a beating morning sun, Clinton strides out of the Oval Office, clapping his hands together a couple of times as he approaches the podium. He has been back from China less than two days, but he exudes energy.
He begins by urging the Republican Congress to "choose partisanship" or what he calls "progress" by passing some remnants of his legislative agenda that Capitol Hill has virtually ignored this year. Aware that his hands are tied with a Congress in the hands of the other party, he announces that he will act on his own to reach out to 3-million low-income people who do not know they are eligible for Medicare. And then he takes a few questions from the assembled press corps. One is about trade legislation. Another about a newspaper report on poor people losing out on health care.
But none about Monica Lewinsky.
As he leaves, someone shouts: "Your thoughts on Roy Rogers?"
Clinton does not let that opportunity pass, and returns to the podium to wrap himself in the warm memories of the deceased movie cowboy. "Like most people my age, I grew up on Roy Rogers, Dale Evans and Trigger and Gabby Hayes. I really appreciate what he stood for, the movies he made, and the kind of values they embodied."
The presidential condolences passed along, he departs for his office.
Tuesday: scandals surface
Not a good day for Team Clinton, as two of his scandals poke their heads up once more.
An appeals court opened the way for Secret Service agents to testify before the grand jury investigating Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky. The federal court rejected claims by the Secret Service - and supported by the Justice Department - that testifying would endanger the president's life.
On a second front, Democratic fund-raiser Maria Hsia is indicted on federal tax charges. Her attorney says prosecutors are trying to force her client to plead guilty on campaign finance charges.
Both developments remind Washington's reporters, analysts and, presumably, the president himself, that any one of several scandals that have plagued his administration could still cause serious trouble. But the White House virtually ignores the criminal investigations, and talks about health care.
Staging yet another media event, Clinton slams insurance companies for failing to guarantee sick and hard to insure people more access to medical care, as required by a 1996 law. Returning once more to his limited power as the chief executive, he orders the Office of Personnel Management to consider canceling contracts of insurance carriers for federal employees if the companies are ignoring the law. It was a good try by the president, but this time the scandal got the big headlines the next morning.
Wednesday: race debate
It is a day of still more announcements from the White House.
Clinton confirms that he is going to Russia again to visit with Boris Yeltsin. He appears with lawmakers and gun control advocates to endorse a bill that would make parents criminally responsible for not safely storing fire arms. And he takes care of some political business, rewarding former Florida Democratic Party chairman Simon Ferro with an ambassadorship to Panama. It is unclear, though, whether the Republican Senate will get around to confirming the Ferro nomination.
But the main public event is Clinton's taping of a public television debate on race.
Loose and chatty, Clinton arrived at a suburban Washington studio full of minutia about Ulysses S. Grant. Having recently read a book about the Civil War general and former president, Clinton concluded that he was a "brilliant man," the best horseman in the Army, and someone who had gotten a bad rap.
There is "not a single solitary shred of evidence that he was ever drunk on the job," Clinton said, though he did concede that Grant was inebriated twice - off duty.
That little piece of history aside, the taping began and Clinton and a panel of columnists and experts began discussing his initiative on race. In the year since he began it, the effort has been held back by dissension on the panel he named and complaints that Clinton is not fully involved in the "dialogue" he tried to foster.
He and the panel spend an hour hashing over the feelings, successes and failures of Native Americans, Chinese Americans and African Americans.
Ever empathic, he notes that his grandmother is one-quarter Cherokee and that he grew up in a segregated South that has shaken off many of its old ways. He cites diversity success stories from California and Fairfax County, Va., but acknowledges Indians may face a future as bleak as their past.
"We're just getting warmed up," he says when moderator Jim Lehrer says it's time to end.
Lehrer was one of the first reporters to ask Clinton about his relationship with Lewinsky, months ago. This time, it didn't come up.
Thursday: down the coast
In a campaign-style trip down the east coast, Clinton hits three cities to raise political money and sell his agenda. His day begins at 7 a.m., when he leaves the White House aboard Marine One, to catch Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base. His 747 touches down at Andrews at 1:40 a.m. Friday, some 18 hours later.
In Atlanta, Clinton shares the stage with House Speaker Newt Gingrich, his chief Republican nemesis, as well as Attorney General Janet Reno, who has made Clinton's life miserable by appointing several independent prosecutors and investigating fund-raising irregularities in Clinton's 1996 campaign.
He has warm words for both Reno and Gingrich, as he launches an anti-drug advertising campaign. Then, he goes to a local hotel to raise money for a Democratic Senate candidate in Georgia.
Twelve hours later, after a stop to visit with firefighters and victims of Florida's fires in Daytona Beach, Clinton is in a huge white tent on the 12-acre estate owned by Stallone.
Located on Biscayne Bay, the estate is a shrine to Stallone's ego and his wealth. A cardboard cutout of the actor as Rocky can be seen from a windowed weight-lifting room en route to the tent where the dinner is held. Most of the media is kept in a guardhouse decorated with a life-size photograph of Rocky and a heavy-handed oil painting by Stallone of the boxer.
Stallone is hoping to sell the home he calls "Casa Rocko" for $27- million, but this night is about raising money for Democrats, not for the actor. The evening will fetch $850,000 for Democrats, who want to retake the House and topple Gingrich, the man Clinton had greeted in Atlanta that morning. What would Newt say about all that money for Democrats? More importantly, what would Reno say?
But Clinton glides over the contradictions of the day, and adds to them. In his remarks to the crowd at Stallone's house, Clinton butters up his host by recalling that Stallone had shared his wisdom about global warming. Stallone had seen the effects of climate change, Clinton said, because the tanned actor spends so much time outside.
Clinton reminded the audience that his administration and the Democrats in Congress want to find a solution to global warming, along with wanting to "save" Social Security and adding money to lower class sizes and improve public education.
He adds that Democrats want to restore the Everglades, too. Last year's bipartisan budget agreement increased money for the Everglades, he pointed out, but this year Republicans have cast votes that "imply they are going to walk away from the commitment made last year."
By this point members of the crowd are yawning. The wife of U.S. Rep. Bob Wexler of Fort Lauderdale, trying to stay warm in the frosty air conditioning, drapes a coat over her shoulders. A few people - including Clinton's brother-in-law - sneak out of the huge white tent to find their way out of Stallone's estate.
So Clinton begins to wrap it up, zigzagging back to a course that portrays him as a president who will work with both parties, if only the Republicans would be reasonable and pass his calls for more money for the Everglades.
"I say this to you because I wasn't a particularly partisan person when I came to Washington. I was a Democrat by heritage, instinct and conviction, but I wanted people to work together," Clinton insisted. "The atmosphere in Washington is too partisan, and we have blinders on - some of the decision-makers not doing what is plainly in the long term best interest of this country."
After bashing Washington, Clinton heads back to the place.
Friday: winding down
It was the end of a slow news week, in which Clinton was able to dominate the headlines. He closed it with the most Reaganesque of events.
On Friday, he awarded the medal of honor to Jacksonville resident Robert Ingram for his bravery as a Navy corpsman in Vietnam 32 years ago. In his remarks, Clinton thanked the members of Congress who had worked to approve the medal - both Democrats and Republicans - and recalled that Ingram suffered severe wounds while tending to dying Marines.
"His vital signs dropped to the point that he was tagged 'killed in action' and placed in a dead pile," Clinton said. "But as you can see, he did not die."
Said Clinton: "We are all proud to call you an American."
Once more, there were no more Monica Lewinsky questions. Clinton had survived another week.

IN MEDIA GLARE, OVERHEATED WEATHER SPAWNS A MAD SERIES OF CATASTROPHES

Full text:   The succession of photos of burning forests, flooded streets, and tornado-torn mobile homes suggests that the weather has gone stark raving mad.
But there's more at work than Mother Nature and her problem child, El Nino.
The effects of a record hot global atmosphere are being magnified by a more overheated media that beams each catastrophe into living rooms, and by a real estate boom that has placed growing numbers of people in disaster-prone areas, experts in several fields say.
``It's a combination,'' National Weather Service Director John J. Kelly said. ``It's been a busy year. I don't think the world is going nuts. Fires have always been there. Think of life before CNN.''
Even without the hype, the weather this year has lurched from extreme to extreme.
The federal government has declared 35 disasters in 1998 - with eight more disaster declarations pending - and the year is barely half over. With 34 disasters declared before July 1, the number of catastrophes is 26 percent higher than recent midyear averages. Although this year's 35 are - for now - far short of the 1996 record total of 75, there are already more disasters this year than in either 1993 or 1995.
First flooding, then drought and then wildfires bedeviled Florida. Disastrous floods hit Vermont, Massachusetts, Ohio and West Virginia. Early in the year, rainstorms bludgeoned California.
``It has been wild,'' said National Climatic Data Center meteorologist Richard Heim, supervising editor of the Climate Variation Bulletin. ``Anytime we've had extremes like the one-two punches like we've had in Florida, it's something to make you sit up and notice.''
So far this year, the insurance industry has paid out more than $4 billion in disaster claims - not including Florida fires and most flooding. That is substantially more than the $2.6 billion paid in all of 1997, said Gary Kerney, assistant vice president of Property Claim Services, which tracks catastrophes for the insurance industry. In 1992, the industry paid out a record $23 billion, and in 1994, it paid $17 billion.
The last six weeks are ``probably as busy as I've seen since I've been working in the catastrophe area,'' said Dan Carrigan, at State Farm, a 15-year veteran of the disaster business.
El Nino, the warming of part of the Pacific Ocean that is the weather scapegoat of the year, cannot be blamed for this summer's floods or fires, said one of the leading experts on the subject, Nicholas Graham, director of experimental forecasts at the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction in La Jolla, Calif. El Nino faded by May; since then, a dozen weather disasters have plagued the nation, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Nor has El Nino's flip side, La Nina, a cooling of waters in the central Pacific, started yet. That brings Graham to one of the first rules of talking about the weather: Normal doesn't exist.
There may always be extreme weather, but Heim, who tracks climate oddities, said that this year there have been an extreme number of extremes.
In recent years, global warming has created stronger and more frequent El Ninos than in the past, said Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. In each of the first five months of 1998, the average global temperature set a new high, the National Climatic Data Center found.
The Earth, Trenberth said, is sweating much like an overheated human body attempting to cool itself. The sweat in this case is more moisture in the atmosphere at some points and less in others. He said there had been a significant increase in the number of downpours of more than 2 inches of rain, while other places are completely cut off from the flow of moisture. For example, the downpour-to-drought switch that took place in Florida has a 1-in-1,000 chance of happening naturally, said David Easterling at the National Climatic Data Center.
``Something real is going on here,'' Trenberth said. ``Certainly this relates to the whole idea of climate change.''
Nonsense, said William Gray, a noted hurricane prognosticator at Colorado State University. ``I don't think the case can be made that there's more extremes of weather now than in the past,'' Gray said. ``We've always had unusual weather - floods, droughts and everything.''
He said that some environmentalists are playing up recent extreme weather events and that they have been joined by the media, which focus on individual tragedies and miss the big picture.
Even experts who disagree on global warming agree that people are paying more attention to weather than they used to.
When he got into the business in 1981, said Kerney, the insurance expert: ``There could be tremendous damage, death and injuries caused by severe weather events in Kansas, for example, and you never heard about them in the media reports.''
Real estate development near flood-prone lakes and rivers only makes matters worse.
``These are popular places to put real estate,'' said Bob Hirsch, chief hydrologist for U.S. Geological Survey, ``but are also areas that are most prone to danger.''
Though tornado damage and the number of twisters are very high this year, that could also be the result of better reporting, Kelly said. In the past, tornadoes could have popped up in rural areas and gone unnoticed, but now the population has spread out. Add to that relatively new radar and more storm-chasing thrill-seekers, Heim said, and few twisters go unreported.

Full text: BEIJING -- The U.K. and China will sign a new air-services agreement that will give British carriers direct routes to Shanghai for the first time, U.K.'s Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said.
The agreement will also bring additional services between London and Beijing for U.K. airlines, Mr. Prescott told reporters at a news conference.
The new services, which are expected to begin in the spring or summer of next year, will be offered by only one airline initially with more airlines to be added later, Mr. Prescott said.
Other details, such as which airlines will be chosen and how many routes will be added, are still being worked out, he said.
Mr. Prescott, who is accompanied by a trade mission of water and aerospace companies, said he and business leaders met with Chinese officials to discuss possible future agreements in the water-treatment, aviation, finance, and insurance sectors.
Chinese officials also brought up the country's continuing plans to build a 100-seat passenger plane with European consortium Airbus Industrie, Mr. Prescott said.
Recent reports that various parties involved in the airplane deal are threatening to pull out have raised speculation that the project may be scrapped. China hopes the project will help the country develop its own aircraft manufacturing industry.
Mr. Prescott also met with Premier Zhu Rongji and other senior Chinese leaders to discuss international economic and political issues, including efforts to combat climate change.

Life's complexity makes us vulnerable

Abstract: That statistic is quoted over and over by people who want us to think about how distant we are from our basic sustenance, how vulnerable our lives have become, how dependent on systems we can't control or even understand. These people intend to scare us in the same way the people who are yammering about the Y2K problem intend to scare us. Y2K is the computer world's label for a bug that apparently infests computer programs everywhere. Y2K stands for "year 2000," K being the scientific abbreviation for "kilo," which means thousand. As you have undoubtedly heard, programmers, back when computer memory was scarce, entered only the last two digits for years - "73" for 1973 - never thinking of the moment when the clock would turn over to "00." Now some credit cards are already bouncing because a computer assumes that "00" means the card expired in 1900. One chemical company, testing for Y2K problems by artificially advancing the date throughout its automated factories, discovered a computer chip that would have shut down a cooling system at midnight on Dec. 31, 1999, probably causing an explosion. That problem got fixed, but, the experts say, half of large corporations and 75 percent of small businesses are unprepared for Y2K, and the government is especially far behind.

Full text:   THE average bite of food eaten by an American travels 1,300 miles from field to mouth.
That statistic is quoted over and over by people who want us to think about how distant we are from our basic sustenance, how vulnerable our lives have become, how dependent on systems we can't control or even understand. These people intend to scare us in the same way the people who are yammering about the Y2K problem intend to scare us.
Y2K is the computer world's label for a bug that apparently infests computer programs everywhere. Y2K stands for "year 2000," K being the scientific abbreviation for "kilo," which means thousand. As you have undoubtedly heard, programmers, back when computer memory was scarce, entered only the last two digits for years - "73" for 1973 - never thinking of the moment when the clock would turn over to "00."
Now some credit cards are already bouncing because a computer assumes that "00" means the card expired in 1900. One chemical company, testing for Y2K problems by artificially advancing the date throughout its automated factories, discovered a computer chip that would have shut down a cooling system at midnight on Dec. 31, 1999, probably causing an explosion. That problem got fixed, but, the experts say, half of large corporations and 75 percent of small businesses are unprepared for Y2K, and the government is especially far behind.
Social Security and Medicare payments could be held up for nobody knows how long, as computers deduce that someone born in 1930 is minus-30 years old.
Here's a typical list of computer-dependent entities that could go haywire: air traffic and railroad control systems, banks, stock exchanges, insurance companies, electric utilities, major manufacturing installations. One consultant estimates that there are 50 million chips embedded in hospital equipment, burglar alarms, oil refineries, power stations, elevators, all of which could shut a machine down if they think it was last serviced in 1900.
The National Federation of Independent Businesses estimates that the Y2K bug will bankrupt 330,000 small businesses.
I have listened to this scare talk with a mixture of disbelief, fear, amusement - and the sort of smugness that doubters can't resist when technology goes awry. Ha! Those smart-aleck computers that are supposed to save us time are now demanding enormous amounts of time just to fix a stupid mistake. (State Farm Insurance has been grappling with the Y2K problem since 1989 and still has 100 employees working on it full time.)
Furthermore, I can see in the shortsightedness of the programmers an apt metaphor for other social shortsightedness. (Such as oil wells or groundwater wells running dry, which will happen about as far ahead of us now as the Y2K problem was in 1970.) But surely this Y2K thing is exaggerated, right?
Then a few weeks ago I was talking with Ray Anderson of Interface carpet company, who told me he had spent $20 million on reprogramming within his firm and feels he's on top of Y2K. But he can't say as much for his suppliers, banks, shippers, electricity sources or customers. Then he told me about a dinner party with a high-ranking military officer at which he asked whether it might be possible that a Y2K glitch could send off a missile.
The general turned white, admitted he'd never thought of that and said he'd find out the very next day. "He won't," said Amory Lovins, who was listening in on our conversation. "It'll take at least six months."
So now I'm taking Y2K seriously. I don't plan to spend December 1999 panicking and hoarding (which, if everyone did it, would create a Y2K problem even if the computers work fine). I'm just going to plant more potatoes and squash and dry beans than usual and lay in extra firewood.
But what about that average bite of food, which presumably could be stuck on a stalled train or hung up by a bounced credit card or a missing Social Security check somewhere on its 1,300-mile journey to the average American?
Thinking about that, I asked my brilliant research assistant Diana Wright to track down where the 1,300-mile number came from. She found it in - believe it or not - a Defense Department study conducted in 1969, right about the time the programmers were creating the Y2K problem.
The Office of Civil Defense tried to calculate how to get food to surviving Americans after a nuclear attack. The analysts looked at where food was grown (mainly the Midwest) and where people lived (mainly the East), made some wild assumptions (such as ignoring fruits and vegetables) and came up with a 1,300-mile average shipping distance. (If it's any comfort, they concluded the distance would be less post-attack, because East Coast populations would be so reduced.)
The number was too low then and must be way too low now, given the globalizing market, lamb from New Zealand, oranges from Israel, apples from Chile, and 50 million more Americans than we had 30 years ago. The point about vulnerability holds, however, enhanced now by our increased dependence on foreign oil and on those millions of buggy computers mediating our transactions.
We may have gotten past the threat of full-out nuclear attack (not sure). We may get past the Y2K meltdown (far from sure). But there are other threats ahead, predictable and unpredictable, probable and improbable, from climate change to terrorists to toxic spills to ebola virus to those asteroids the movies are so obsessed with.
Why do we go on making our life support systems ever more interdependent and unresilient?
Meadows is an adjunct professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College.

WASHINGTON - With every photo of flooded streets, burning forests

Full text:   WASHINGTON - With every photo of flooded streets, burning forests and tornado-torn mobile homes, it seems that the weather has gone stark raving mad.
But there's more at work than Mother Nature and her problem child, El Nino.
The effects of a record hot global atmosphere are being magnified by a more-overheated media beaming each catastrophe into living rooms, and a real estate boom that has placed growing numbers of people in disaster-prone areas, experts in several fields say.
"It's a combination," National Weather Service Director John J. Kelly said. "It's been a busy year. I don't think the world is going nuts. Fires have always been there. Think of life before CNN."
Even without the hype, the weather this year has lurched from extreme to extreme.
The federal government has declared 35 disasters in 1998 - with eight more disaster declarations pending - and the year is barely half over. With 34 disasters declared before July 1, the number of catastrophes is 26 percent higher than recent mid-year averages. While 1998 isn't near the 75 disasters declared in 1996, there are already more disasters this year than in either 1993 or 1995.
Flooding morphed into drought and then into fires to bedevil Florida. Vermont, Massachusetts, Ohio and West Virginia are awash in disastrous floods.
"It has been wild," said National Climatic Data Center meteorologist Richard Heim, supervising editor of the Climate Variation Bulletin. "Anytime we've had extremes like the one-two punches like we've had in Florida, it's something to make you sit up and notice."
So far this year, the insurance industry has paid out more than $4 billion in disaster claims - not including Florida fires and most flooding - which is way more than the $2.6 billion paid in all of 1997, said Gary Kerney, assistant vice president of Property Claim Services, which tracks catastrophes for the insurance industry.
In 1992, the industry paid out $23 billion, and in 1994 it paid $17 billion.
The past six weeks have driven insurers nuts.
"It's probably as busy as I've seen since I've been working in the catastrophe area," said Dan Carrigan, at State Farm, a 15-year veteran of the disaster business.
El Ni o, the warming of the Pacific Ocean and weather scapegoat of the year, can't be blamed for this summer's floods or still-festering fires, said one of the top El Ni o gurus, Nicholas Graham, director of experimental forecasts at the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction in La Jolla, Calif.
El Ni o faded by May and since then, a dozen weather disasters have plagued the nation, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Nor has El Ni o's flip side, La Ni a, a cooling of waters in the central Pacific, started yet. That brings Graham to one of the first rules of talking about the weather: Normal doesn't exist.
"We're kind of hypersensitive because the weather during the winter was really strange," Graham said. "The weather's always strange. How often do you see an article saying the weather around the country has sure been normal?"
There may always be extreme weather, but Heim, who tracks climate oddities, said this year there has been an extreme number of extremes.
Global warming has created stronger and more frequent El Ni os than in the past, said Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. In each of the first five months of 1998, the average global temperature set a record high, the National Climatic Data Center found.
Trenberth said the Earth is sweating much like an overheated human body attempting to cool itself. The sweat in this case is more moisture in the atmosphere at some points and less in others.
He said there's a significant increase in the number of downpours of more than 2 inches of rain, while other places are completely cut off from the flow of moisture.
For example, the downpour-to-drought switch that took place in Florida has a 1-in-1,000 chance of happening naturally, said David Easterling at the National Climatic Data Center.
"Something real is going on here," Trenberth said. "Certainly this relates to the whole idea of climate change."
Bunk, said William Gray, a noted hurricane prognosticator at Colorado State University.
"I don't think the case can be made that there's more extremes of weather now than in the past," Gray said. "We've always had unusual weather - floods, droughts and everything."
Some environmentalists are playing up recent extreme weather events and they are joined by the media, which focuses on individual tragedies and misses the big picture, Gray said.
Even experts who disagree on global warming agree that people are paying more attention to weather than they used to.
When he got into the business in 1981, said Kerney, the insurance expert, "There could be tremendous damage, death and injuries caused by severe weather events in Kansas for example and you never heard about them in the media reports."
As a Washington television meteorologist, Bob Ryan, told disaster experts last week, "If you think you've seen a lot of El Ni o, wait until La Ni a gets into 'Dateline {NBC}' this winter."
Real estate development near floodprone lakes and rivers only makes matters worse.
"These are popular places to put real estate, but are also areas that are most prone to danger," said Bob Hirsch, chief hydrologist for U.S. Geological Survey.
Though tornado damage and the number of twisters are way up this year, that could also be attributed to better reporting, Kelly said.
In the past, tornadoes could have popped up in rural areas and gone unnoticed, but now the population has spread out.
Add to that relatively new radar and more storm-chasing thrill- seekers, Heim said, and few twisters go unreported.
Even the weather victims believe this is just a freak thing, but that's of little comfort. Jimmy Mutter, 16, had to flee his Mims, Fla., house at 9 p.m. Wednesday when the junkyard down the road exploded as one of the dozens of daily drought-stoked fires approached.
"It's been bad," Mutter said. "Mother Nature is just taking its course."
Unfortunately for Mutter, that course is right through his house.

A Hot (and Cold) New Investment Opportunity; Weather-Sensitive Firms Can Hedge Their Bets With Derivatives Based on Mother Nature's Whims: [FINAL Edition]

Abstract: What's more unpredictable than the weather? So now, some companies are sheltering themselves from adverse weather with something new -- weather derivatives. Potential players in this market include just about any company that could face financial ruin from a sudden change in the weather -- theme parks hedging against excessive summer rainfall that keeps park attendance down, beer companies worried about a summer too cool for drinking ice-cold beer, thermal-underwear retailers anxious about a mild winter, school districts preparing for an icy winter that means higher heating bills, and newly deregulated energy companies protecting themselves from unfavorable temperatures. Recently, a retail catalogue company that sells thermal underwear expressed interest in a weather hedge with Enron. The company, whose name (Lynda) Clemmons declined to disclose, sent out its catalogue in November and found through market research that people would throw the catalogue away if November was mild, suspecting they wouldn't need long underwear that winter. But customers would likely place an order if November was cold.

Full text: Global warming, greenhouse gases and the most extreme El Nin~o since the 1800s are contributing to severe swings in climate and sending companies scurrying to find ways to protect themselves against the vagaries of Mother Nature.
For years, businesses have hedged against economic losses with financial products based on interest rates, currencies, commodities, even the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. These products, cooked up with computers and often amazingly complicated, are called derivatives because they are financial instruments derived from different bets on the future movement of just about anything that can't be predicted with certainty.
What's more unpredictable than the weather? So now, some companies are sheltering themselves from adverse weather with something new -- weather derivatives.
Potential players in this market include just about any company that could face financial ruin from a sudden change in the weather -- theme parks hedging against excessive summer rainfall that keeps park attendance down, beer companies worried about a summer too cool for drinking ice-cold beer, thermal-underwear retailers anxious about a mild winter, school districts preparing for an icy winter that means higher heating bills, and newly deregulated energy companies protecting themselves from unfavorable temperatures.
Two years ago, Enron Corp., a Houston-based energy company, started looking at ways to hedge weather risks, said Lynda Clemmons, director of Enron Capital and Trade Resources Corp.
"We were looking at our own exposure," Clemmons said. "We wanted to start building a diverse portfolio of weather risks."
Since last July, Enron has become a major player in that market, taking a position in about 170 weather-derivatives transactions with a maximum exposure of $5 million to $10 million each.
Recently, a retail catalogue company that sells thermal underwear expressed interest in a weather hedge with Enron. The company, whose name Clemmons declined to disclose, sent out its catalogue in November and found through market research that people would throw the catalogue away if November was mild, suspecting they wouldn't need long underwear that winter. But customers would likely place an order if November was cold.
"They wanted to hedge against potential lost sales if the dates they sent out the catalogues were warm," Clemmons said.
The company could take a position that would allow it to protect itself from mild weather by buying a contract that specified it could collect a certain amount of money for each day in November when the temperature is above a certain level.
Unlike insurance against bad weather, the company buying a weather derivative would not have to prove that it actually lost money, only that the temperature was above a certain strike point in the contract. Enron or some other company would take the opposite position, betting that the temperature would not hit the specified levels.
Weather derivatives have been traded for only a little over a year, but experts think the market is set to take off and could reach $70 billion to $100 billion in just a few years, in part because the 1997-98 weather has been so unusual.
"El Nin~o has been an overwhelming factor, causing one of the warmest, wettest winters on record," said Andy Ertel, a principal at Natsource Inc., a broker in the weather derivatives market. "People have seen dramatic effects on their businesses."
In the Manhattan trading room of Natsource, Ertel and his staff preside over weather data on 8,000 cities, following heat, cold, rain and snow.
"We had a major snow-blower maker do a hedge based on a basket of 10 different cities," Ertel said. "He got killed last winter because there was so little snow in New York."
There are few reliable studies about how much money businesses lose each year because of the weather. But a study by Yale economists said that about 5 percent of the gross national product of the United States is affected by climate change -- a broader measure than weather. That's about $350 billion a year.
Natsource held its first conference on weather derivatives here in April. About 150 companies showed up -- from agricultural firms to trading houses to energy companies.
The big players right now in the weather derivatives business are companies such as Koch Industries, Enron and Natsource. Natsource is a broker between the two principals in any derivatives deal. Enron and Koch are both power companies that take a position on one side of a derivatives contract, essentially betting that the weather will be better -- or worse -- than the company betting on the other side.
One party in the deal, for instance, agrees to pay the second party if temperatures fall below an agreed-on level. If the mercury rises above a specific point, the other party pays.
Contracts can be based on degree days, minimum and maximum temperatures, rain and snowfall levels, wind speed, sunshine and humidity indexes.
A few mainstream brokerage firms are getting into the act. Merrill Lynch & Co., for example, is using weather derivatives as another way to manage risks for its clients.
"Last year was a great year to get the business started," said Eric Tell, vice president of global new derivatives at Merrill Lynch. "El Nin~o really demonstrated to companies that earnings would take a hit because of a warm winter. . . . We take this very seriously."
The industry that will likely be the biggest user of weather contracts is the utility business. More than a dozen states have deregulated utilities, allowing customers to choose their provider of gas or electricity. That competition -- and the entry of new energy providers into the market -- makes it more important for utilities to be able to hedge their risks with the weather.
One of the country's largest providers of energy, Consolidated Edison Inc., is already considering a spinoff of weather derivatives.
"We think new market participants will be looking for volume hedges," said Charlie Weliky, chief operating officer of Con Edison Energy, a subsidiary of Con Ed that is part of the restructured wholesale energy market. "If a company predicts that customers will use X amount of energy and they don't, the company won't earn as much. Con Ed Energy is planning to buy weather hedges and reformat them specifically so energy companies will want to buy them . . . in addition to buying them for ourselves."
For example, new energy companies that supply energy directly to Con Ed's retail customers must now forecast on an hourly basis the customers' energy use. Con Ed will offer a service that will allow those companies to hedge their risk in case their forecasts are wrong.
The hedges are not risk free for those taking a position in weather derivatives. "You have to have financial staying power," Weliky said. "It's just like Las Vegas. Is 100 years of weather data enough to hedge against? . . . The real downside is if you haven't done the math correctly."
With all the interest in weather, there needs to be a reliable source for weather information. That's where the U.S. government comes in.
Allan Eustis, chief of the National Weather Service's office of industrial meteorology, has become a popular figure on the weather derivatives conference circuit as companies realize they can't just stick a temperature gauge in the window to come up with an official temperature.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is the quality control because it keeps the official highs and lows that are used in legal proceedings. NOAA creates an index using heating degree days and cooling degree days. Each of those terms measures the departure of the average temperature of any day from 65 degrees -- which is considered the temperature at which most people need neither heat nor air conditioning.
"I was worried about the government weather folks being able to make or break a market," Eustis said. "But we're just the baseline forecaster against whom they bet."

WASHINGTON - With every photo of flooded streets, burning forests and tornado-torn mobile homes, it seems that the weather has gone stark raving mad.
But there's more at work than Mother Nature and her problem child, El Ni o.
The effects of a record hot global atmosphere are being magnified by an overheated media beaming each catastrophe into living rooms and a real estate boom that has placed growing numbers of people in disaster-prone areas, experts in several fields say.
"It's a combination," National Weather Service Director John Kelly said. "It's been a busy year. I don't think the world is going nuts. Fires have always been there. Think of life before CNN."
Even without the hype, the weather this year has lurched from extreme to extreme.
The federal government has declared 35 disasters in 1998 - with eight more disaster declarations pending - and the year is barely half over. With 34 disasters declared before July 1, the number of catastrophes is 26 percent higher than recent mid-year averages. While 1998 isn't near the 75 disasters declared in 1996, there are already more disasters this year than in either 1993 or 1995.
Flooding morphed into drought and then into fires to bedevil Florida. Vermont, Massachusetts, Ohio and West Virginia are awash in disastrous floods.

Chagall has arrived, but don't ask how Vanessa Thorpe on the secrecy and danger that surround the transport of art: [FINAL Edition]

Author: Thorpe, Vanessa

Abstract: IN ONE of the most complicated fine art transport operations ever carried out, more than eight separate agencies have combined to bring a series of large Chagall murals to Britain for the first time. The perilous six-day journey began two weeks ago at the murals' permanent home in Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery. Each work was painstakingly packed in specially made Swedish crates and then moved by crane. From there, they travelled in convoy by road and sea, following a secret route and under the devoted guardianship of a team of Russian curators and restorers, until they reached the Royal Academy in London. The unique Chagall paintings, which are watercolour and gouache on canvas, at one time decorated the walls of Moscow's Yiddish Theatre and show a colourful assortment of Jewish entertainers. Neglected for years as the Yiddish tradition dwindled under Communism, the recently restored works will be on display at the Royal Academy of Arts from Thursday. Each mural has been positioned around the main hall of the academy's Sackler Gallery in a close copy of the positioning originally intended by the artist.

Full text: IN ONE of the most complicated fine art transport operations ever carried out, more than eight separate agencies have combined to bring a series of large Chagall murals to Britain for the first time.
The perilous six-day journey began two weeks ago at the murals' permanent home in Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery. Each work was painstakingly packed in specially made Swedish crates and then moved by crane. From there, they travelled in convoy by road and sea, following a secret route and under the devoted guardianship of a team of Russian curators and restorers, until they reached the Royal Academy in London.
The intricate transport operation surrounding the murals is new proof of the way modern technology is defeating the multiple hazards of moving international works of art. Hurdles such as customs, climate change and security have all now become negotiable. The price tag though, remains high.
Government indemnity schemes such as those currently underwriting exhibitions in Great Britain and the United States have helped to make insurance less expensive, but the cost of hiring lorries and equipment can still be prohibitive for all but the biggest name galleries. The fee for the hire of the climate- controlled vehicles used on the murals' journey from Moscow, for example, was around pounds 12,300.
The unique Chagall paintings, which are watercolour and gouache on canvas, at one time decorated the walls of Moscow's Yiddish Theatre and show a colourful assortment of Jewish entertainers. Neglected for years as the Yiddish tradition dwindled under Communism, the recently restored works will be on display at the Royal Academy of Arts from Thursday. Each mural has been positioned around the main hall of the academy's Sackler Gallery in a close copy of the positioning originally intended by the artist.
The largest painting, 284x787cm, faces what would have been the entrance to the original Yiddish theatre and features, among many other characters, the image of Chagall himself being carried by the theatre manager towards the figure of the proprietor. On the right hangs a group of individual panels: one showing a fiddler, one a dancer and one a cantor.
The curtains that Chagall designed to hang around the stage have long since disintegrated, but bore the image of a goat's head, the artist's own shorthand symbol for Judaism. An accompanying ceiling painting has also been lost, but the Royal Academy's Sue Compton believes it portrayed a loving couple rather like the pair of entwined, translucent dancers on the mural which now hangs at the back of the make-believe auditorium.
When the rolls of canvas arrived in London at the beginning of last week, they were slowly stretched out over wooden frames and then left overnight to settle on a table that took up most of the gallery.
"Unfortunately our chief restorer, the man who breathed life back into these canvasses, is now dead," sighed the Tretyakov's curator of 19th- century and early 20th-century art, Alla Loukanova, as she watched over the unpacking of her babies. "All the same, it is very good indeed for me to see them here."
The restored murals were first shown in the new wing of her gallery in Moscow seven years ago. "There were still people around in Moscow who remembered them," said Miss Loukanova, "although, of course, only in the second Jewish Theatre building - a larger one, which was in turn closed down in 1949 when the tradition was destroyed."
Visitors to the academy's Chagall exhibition this week should be mindful of the expense and effort which have gone into its staging, according to the former freelance curator Michael Tarantino, the man now in charge of organising exhibitions at Oxford's Museum of Modern Art.
"It is so difficult to stage an important foreign show these days," he said. "The hire fees are very high, unless you can work in collaboration with other institutions to reduce the cost of catalogues, and even then, when you add the transport to the total, it shoots up."
The newest technology does not come cheap, and Helen Wilson, exhibition coordinator for Wingate and Johnston, the Peckham-based company that brought in the Chagalls, argues that cutting edge equipment is vital because it reduces the risk of damage or theft. For her the worrying part about the murals' transportation was coping with Russian bureaucracy.
"It was hard to find out what the regulations were and what was going on," she said. "Although, to be fair, there is now a transportation company which is allied to the State Russian Museum and that allows you to have some confidence in the vehicles provided."
Ms Wilson refuses to discuss the route the convoy took and confirms that her staff are instructed not to talk about their precious cargo during the journey. "We keep things very low key, except in countries where a police escort is provided, such as Italy or Spain," she said.
"It is usually an indemnity condition that the vehicle is never left alone. So this time the driver slept in the cab."
To reduce the risk of theft, customs officials now rarely examine fine art and simply accept signed authorities from the museums. Any unnecessary opening of containers could result in theft and could destroy the controlled atmosphere. And it is damage, says James Emson of the Art Loss Register, which is the chief enemy.
"Insurance is high because of the dangers of breaking or knocking the work of art in transit," he said. "There was frightful damage, for example, nine years ago at Heathrow when fire ravaged a depot."
Theft still poses a problem. There are currently 355 stolen Picassos, 109 Andy Warhols and 121 Rembrandts unaccounted for somewhere in the world and, while it might seem unlikely that anyone would attempt to walk off with a crate full of Chagall murals, Mr Emson points out that, even when a work is too well known to be sold, a ransom can be demanded.
On two separate occasions in the past decade, masterpieces, including two Picassos and a Meijer de Haan, have been temporarily snatched as they languished in customs at JFK airport in New York.
"Security is only ever as good as the people you have," said Mr Emson. "That is always the weak link, and works of art are always vulnerable in transit."

Abstract: House Republicans are pumping billions into antidrug programs that have also become a front line of defense for the GOP in the political wars over tobacco this election year. From the Customs Service to the Pentagon and even the Small Business Administration, appropriations bills this week are heavy with spending items ordered up by a leadership drug task force. About $2 billion in add-ons are being sought, running from $120,000 for four Toyota Land Cruisers for drug agents along the Bolivian border to hundreds of millions for Coast Guard cutters and Customs Service planes. Just as the White House paints the GOP as serving big tobacco companies at the expense of children, Republicans counter that President Clinton has been lax in fighting drugs. Increasingly, GOP leaders speak of tobacco in the same context as drugs, and the party's teenage-smoking bill will be packaged with antidrug legislation next month.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are pumping billions into antidrug programs that have also become a front line of defense for the GOP in the political wars over tobacco this election year.
From the Customs Service to the Pentagon and even the Small Business Administration, appropriations bills this week are heavy with spending items ordered up by a leadership drug task force. About $2 billion in add-ons are being sought, running from $120,000 for four Toyota Land Cruisers for drug agents along the Bolivian border to hundreds of millions for Coast Guard cutters and Customs Service planes.
Budget restraints have so far prevented funding of the most costly new hardware, but Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested yesterday that a "year-end deal" with the White House could yet yield extra money for drug interdiction.
The speaker made the drug war an early priority this year. But it has taken on greater political significance now with the collapse of major tobacco legislation.
Just as the White House paints the GOP as serving big tobacco companies at the expense of children, Republicans counter that President Clinton has been lax in fighting drugs. Increasingly, GOP leaders speak of tobacco in the same context as drugs, and the party's teenage-smoking bill will be packaged with antidrug legislation next month.
The Federal Trade Commission would be given increased power to police tobacco ads aimed at underage smokers. And a new Republican-backed national advertising campaign against teenage smoking would also target drug use and be run through an existing antidrug office in the government.
Melding the two issues may be good politics, but the leadership itself still struggles with the message. "Tobacco is a drug," said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R., Texas) flatly. Yet Ohio Rep. John Boehner, chairman of the House GOP conference, took a more resigned tone. "Teenagers are going to smoke," he said. "It's one of those rites of passage."
Tobacco wasn't the GOP's only worry as lawmakers went home for the July Fourth recess yesterday. Conservative plans to kill funding for the National Endowment for the Arts were upended in a surprise vote in the House Appropriations Committee. And on the House floor, 155 Republicans joined an almost equal number of Democrats to trounce a leadership-backed resolution governing debate on a Treasury and general government spending bill.
Election-year fears in the Farm Belt prompted a Capitol news conference by Mr. Gingrich promising "to lead on the issues that matter to American farmers and ranchers." The House GOP was embarrassed last month by its handling of popular crop-insurance legislation, but Mr. Gingrich pledged action on trade and the long-delayed debate on financing for the International Monetary Fund.
The trade votes are expected in September, but the IMF issue could be joined as early as next month when the House takes up the foreign-aid budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
Following is a summary of major spending legislation yesterday:
House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved competing versions of a $13 billion-plus natural-resources bill funding the Interior Department and arts agencies. The NEA emerged triumphant, after a 31-27 vote restoring $98 million for the coming fiscal year. But the Clinton administration's wildlife and environmental initiatives took a beating on both sides of the Capitol.
The House bill would terminate a Columbia River basin environmental-planning project covering millions of acres in six Western states. The Senate measure adds dozens of pages of its own affecting the management of federal lands and forests as well as the rights of Indian tribes. Oil interests won a one-year moratorium on new regulations governing royalty payments owed the government for oil produced on public lands. Ranchers blocked the introduction of grizzly bears into Idaho and Montana, and Appropriations Chairman Ted Stevens added a provision to allow construction of a gravel road in the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, a protected wilderness area in Alaska.
The chairman has fiercely defended the amendment, entitled a "health and safety act" for the small hamlet of King Cove, which would be served by the road. But the proposal has infuriated environmentalists, and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt says the sacrifice of habitat is "incalculable."
The White House won at least a partial victory in its efforts to raise the ceiling on government-insured home mortgages. Despite misgivings by the GOP leadership, the House Appropriations panel endorsed a move allowing the Federal Housing Administration to insure mortgages up to $109,000 nationwide -- an increase of $23,000. For high-cost areas, the ceiling would jump to $197,000 from $170,000.
The decision is in line with a similar Senate plan and fits into a $93.5 billion bill funding not only housing but also veterans, science and environmental programs. As part of the same bill, auto-industry allies have added sweeping new language intended to bar the Environmental Protection Agency from educational and outreach activities related to climate change and last year's Kyoto Protocol global-warming pact.
-- A $33.2 billion budget for the departments of Commerce, State and Justice won approval from the Senate Appropriations panel after fierce, angry exchanges between Chairman Stevens and Sen. Slade Gorton (R., Wash.,) over a fishing-rights dispute in West Coast waters. Mr. Stevens, who is waging a war with Norwegian-financed American Seafood Inc., based in Mr. Gorton's home state, agreed to back down on major points. But the final bill would still bar three large trawlers owned by the Seattle company from returning to U.S. waters until the fall of 1999. The measure also sets a standard that individual fishing quotas issued after Sept. 30, 2000, will go only to U.S. citizens or entities that are 75%-owned by Americans.

Abstract: Disease and habitat loss will take a major toll on the millions of birds and animals that make use of the Prairies if the climate warms as predicted, says a study commissioned by the World Wildlife Fund. Droughts are a fact of life on the Prairies regardless of greenhouse gas emissions. A serious drought generally strikes the Prairies once every 30 to 50 years. The last significant drought in 1988 led to net income losses for farmers that reached as high as 78 per cent in Saskatchewan. More than $1.3 billion in drought, crop insurance and special drought assistance was paid out to mitigate the damages that occurred that year. Scientists asked by the department to look at global warming scenarios are predicting warmer temperatures, generally drier conditions and less severe winters for the Prairies.

Full text:   Disease and habitat loss will take a major toll on the millions of birds and animals that make use of the Prairies if the climate warms as predicted, says a study commissioned by the World Wildlife Fund.
The year-long study commissioned scientists to use sophisticated computer modelling programs to simulate potential changes in the environment based on the rise in greenhouse gases.
Predictive studies on climate change have been done before, but this one was unique in that it focused on the impact on vegetation and habitat.
University of Toronto scientist Jay Markham says such changes can be predicted by looking at climatic conditions that favour different types of plants and then by comparing them with the various climate scenarios in the future.
"Whichever scenario you use, and there are a number of them out there," says Markham, "the end result is that the Prairies end up being particularly hard hit."
Malcolm says he was initially surprised by the findings which he arrived at with Adam Markham of World Wildlife Fund International in Washington.
"I thought that we would see the tree line rising quickly up the Rocky Mountains," he says. "And that is the case. But the pace of change on the Prairies was most pronounced."
Looked at more closely, the results aren't so difficult to explain, says Malcolm.
The Prairies are home to hundreds of thousands of shallow potholes and wetlands that provide critical habitat for millions of shorebirds, ducks, and geese, which in turn are an important food source for predators.
Even under so-called normal conditions, the slightest variation in precipitation and temperatures can significantly alter the size of these wetlands in a given year.
"Many kinds of migratory birds take shelter in temporary marshes that form on the prairie early in the year," says Malcolm.
"As the climate warms, these marshes will dry up earlier. Farmers will be tempted to use these dry conditions to cultivate earlier. And this will force birds to fly farther north for acceptable nesting sites."
Any trend towards further warming will likely dry up many of these wetlands altogether, irrespective of the fact that global change may bring more precipitation, says Malcolm.
Droughts are a fact of life on the Prairies regardless of greenhouse gas emissions. A serious drought generally strikes the Prairies once every 30 to 50 years. The last significant drought in 1988 led to net income losses for farmers that reached as high as 78 per cent in Saskatchewan. More than $1.3 billion in drought, crop insurance and special drought assistance was paid out to mitigate the damages that occurred that year.
The World Wildlife Fund study falls into line with many of the predictions of Environment Canada.
Scientists asked by the department to look at global warming scenarios are predicting warmer temperatures, generally drier conditions and less severe winters for the Prairies.

Water everywhere - except in the tap: It costs more to buy a house beside a river or the sea - for now. Changes in climate could alter all that. Anne Spackman reports: [Surveys edition]

Abstract: Homeowners still counting the cost of Easter's freak rains in Britain might be interested to hear what is happening to flood victims in America. Residents in exposed areas of the US - in particular, Florida - are discovering there is a limit to the pity and the pay-outs their plight engenders. Some Florida homeowners have already seen their flood insurance premiums quadruple. As the state's weather becomes more volatile, the fear is that cover may be withdrawn completely from those living in the most vulnerable areas. Insurers in the UK insist flood cover will continue to be provided as part of a standard insurance package. (In this respect the UK is unusual, as in most European countries flood protection is either an extra or not offered at all.) However, coastal erosion is not an insurable risk and tends to affect properties in the same vulnerable areas - particularly East Anglia.

Full text: Homeowners still counting the cost of Easter's freak rains in Britain might be interested to hear what is happening to flood victims in America. Residents in exposed areas of the US - in particular, Florida - are discovering there is a limit to the pity and the pay-outs their plight engenders.
Some Florida homeowners have already seen their flood insurance premiums quadruple. As the state's weather becomes more volatile, the fear is that cover may be withdrawn completely from those living in the most vulnerable areas.
For now, houses on the seafront in the UK are expected to sell for a 20 per cent premium; in the US, with its far sunnier coastline, the premium is even higher. But if the evidence is that global warming is changing weather patterns for good, buyers will have to balance great views against great risks.
Figures from the Insurance Information Institute show that 21 of 25 of the biggest weather-related insurance pay-outs in the US have occurred in the past 10 years. Hurricane Andrew, which hit south Florida in August 1992, was the event that changed attitudes.
It produced a bill for damages of $15.5bn. Only one previous incident had exceeded the $1bn barrier. "If a major hurricane like that were to hit a city like Miami, the damages claims could exceed $50bn," says the institute's Loretta Worters.
"All coastal areas are high-risk, whether they are in Florida, Long Island or New Jersey. It's a question of how close the individual property is to the water."
She says the size of the insurance pay-outs, coupled with increasingly sophisticated systems of risk analysis, mean homeowners' "catastrophe loading" has risen fourfold since Hurricane Andrew. Now, insurers are questioning whether the system can continue in its present form. "There is a reluctance to continue to pay out," she says.
By comparison, the UK's weather-related claims are tiny. In 1997 they cost the insurance industry £377m, compared with £393m for subsidence (also a weather-related issue), £247m for fire and £513m for domestic burglaries.
Insurers in the UK insist flood cover will continue to be provided as part of a standard insurance package. (In this respect the UK is unusual, as in most European countries flood protection is either an extra or not offered at all.) However, coastal erosion is not an insurable risk and tends to affect properties in the same vulnerable areas - particularly East Anglia.
The Association of British Insurers dismisses reports that surfaced after the floods which suggested that areas such as East Anglia and the Northamptonshire flood plain might be blacklisted by insurance companies. But they admit insurance costs could well rise.
"If flooding has occurred more than once, an insurer might refuse cover until certain protection works have been carried out," says Vic Rance of the ABI. "The company might increase the premium or impose a high excess in case of flooding, but it would be exceedingly rare for cover to be withdrawn."
It is possible that insurers will adopt the postcode system to identify areas of highest flood risk, as they do when setting premiums for subsidence and burglary. "Insurers may start to differentiate on flood risk in the long term," Mr Rance says, "but so far flooding has been so erratic, it seems unlikely".
In Florida and California, insurers are most concerned about damage to coastal property caused by hurricanes, mudslides and earthquakes. In the UK, insurers say they are "relaxed" about the coastline. They believe coastal defences will withstand the expected increase in sea levels in East Anglia, of 38cms by 2050.
However, if climate change intensifies and sea levels rise more quickly, the industry would have to reassess that risk. As a result, a number of UK insurers, led by General Accident, have signed up to a United Nations initiative on environmental responsibility.
"If there is an increase in severe weather, it is the insurance industry which will bear the brunt initially," David Crichton of GA points out. "We are lobbying governments to do something about climate change and committing ourselves to behave in an environmentally responsible way."
In the short term, the UK industry is far more worried about river, rather than sea flooding. It is worried that planners are approving housing developments in areas prone to flooding.
"With the pressure on available land we are concerned that building may take place against the advice of the Environment Agency," says Vic Rance of the ABI. There may be a shift towards the system which exists in Scotland, whereby developers must check that insurance cover will be available before they start new housing schemes.
There is one other fear associated with climate change and new housing developments: it is not that too much water will come through the door, but that not enough will come out of the taps.
Michael Sayer, a Norfolk farmer, is also chairman of the local branch of the Country Landowners Association. His family have been measuring rainfall on their land since the day his father returned from war in 1945. For 30 years their recordings barely varied. Since then, they have become increasingly volatile. April was the wettest month ever recorded but there have also been periods of serious drought.
He says: "The basic theory of climate change is that as the hydrologic cycle intensifies, you get an increase in overall rainfall, but the distribution changes. There are more flash floods, more run-off and more erosion, but there are longer periods of drought. Our figures would suggest this is happening."
Such were the problems with water supply caused by drought in his part of Norfolk that a new borehole had to be sunk on Sayer's land to cope with the demands of a huge new housing development on the outskirts of Norwich, called Thorpe Marriott. "They simply ran out of water," Sayer says.
Five years on, building is continuing. But Sayer fears his water supply is not growing at the same rate. The CLA is opposing Norfolk's plans for a further 61,000 new homes on the basis that there is no evidence of sufficient water to supply them.
While the US faces up to a potentially wet and stormy future, it seems that homeowners in the UK may be in danger of facing the ancient mariner's dilemma: "Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink". Copyright Financial Times Limited 1998. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: In recommending early action rather than more study, [Stuart Smith] noted that if the worries about global warming prove premature, Canadians will have time to adjust their response. He put needed perspective on the cost issue by reminding Canadians of the important side benefits of boosting pollution control and energy efficiency: cleaner, healthier air, and a more efficient and therefore productive economy.

Full text: A non-partisan panel of distinguished Canadians is offering prudent advice in urging government, business and individuals to take action against global warming now. As the advisory group says, Canada needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions if only as insurance to protect itself against the potential worst effects of artificial climate change.
Coming from 25 Order of Canada recipients who approached the problem in objective fashion, the panel's report has considerable credibility. All regions and sectors of the economy were represented in the three-month study, including business, labour, environmental organizations and First Nations. The group reached a consensus that makes good sense.
Although they acknowledged that uncertainty surrounds the science of climate change, the panelists concluded there's enough evidence to suggest that rising temperatures pose potentially calamitous consequences.
They made a compelling argument that unanswered questions and concerns about the costs of better pollution controls can't be used to justify inaction. Former Ontario Liberal leader Stuart Smith, the panel moderator, made a telling point in urging Canadians to heed the lessons of the Titanic. "If we think those icebergs are out there, we'd better start steering now, because if we wait until we're 100-per-cent sure, we won't be able to steer away fast enough."
In recommending early action rather than more study, Smith noted that if the worries about global warming prove premature, Canadians will have time to adjust their response. He put needed perspective on the cost issue by reminding Canadians of the important side benefits of boosting pollution control and energy efficiency: cleaner, healthier air, and a more efficient and therefore productive economy.
Those benefits need to be considered along with the costs of controls -- and the costs of extreme weather events which could be caused by global warming. A new Environment Canada report suggests that warmer temperatures pose the danger of a rise in the number of extremely hot summer days; more heavy rainfalls, flash floods and hail storms; and fewer light rainfalls. Problems such as these would put severe strain on municipal sewers.
The panel's message should kick-start the federal and provincial governments to begin living up to the commitments they've made on global warming. At the Kyoto climate change summit last December, Canada agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by six per cent below 1990 levels as of 2012. But instead of proceeding, federal and provincial politicians already seem to have lost any sense of urgency. In fact, at a federal-provincial meeting in April, environment and energy ministers put concrete action on hold. They decided to spend the next 18 months studying the economic impact of emission cuts. That's a far cry from a call to action.
The lack of leadership in Ottawa is especially disappointing. All talk, and no action, is an invitation to failure and a gamble that simply isn't worth taking.

Abstract: The Government yesterday moved to avert fears that some parts of Britain could become "no-go" areas for insurance companies, who fear huge bills through flooding due to global warming. Environment Minister Mr Michael Meacher urged the public not to "leap to conclusions" after a warning from a climate action group that one firm had stopped cover in high-risk areas.

Full text: The Government yesterday moved to avert fears that some parts of Britain could become "no-go" areas for insurance companies, who fear huge bills through flooding due to global warming.
Environment Minister Mr Michael Meacher urged the public not to "leap to conclusions" after a warning from a climate action group that one firm had stopped cover in high-risk areas.
Mr Walter Menzies, chief executive of Sustainability North West, said insurance companies in the low-lying Fylde area of Lancashire feared the costs of rising sea levels could run into millions.
"One insurance company has stopped cover in high-risk areas, so we have clear implications," he said.
Mr Menzies spoke out at a Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions news conference in London on the threat to the economy in every part of the UK as the effects of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere take hold.
Mr Meacher, who was unveiling the Government's plans for the world's first integrated inquiry into the impact of climate change, said: "I don't think we should leap to the conclusion that the Fylde coast is a no-go area for future development."

"If an industrialised, heavily-developed region like ours can get its act together, so can the rest of the UK."
Mr Meacher, who yesterday5 unveiled the Government's plans for the world's first integrated inquiry into the impact of climate change, said: "I don't think we should leap to the conclusion that the Fylde coast is a no-go area for future development.
"But it is precisely this attempt to quantify the consequences of climate change that we need to look at.

Abstract: HALF of Britain's most fertile farmland could be barren within 100 years because of global warming, Government scientists warned yesterday. All land lying less than 15ft above sea level will be at risk from salt contamination as the oceans slowly rise, they said. For the next two years, scientists will study the likely effects of climate change on East Anglia and the North-West. A full UK study will follow.

Full text:   HALF of Britain's most fertile farmland could be barren within 100 years because of global warming, Government scientists warned yesterday.
All land lying less than 15ft above sea level will be at risk from salt contamination as the oceans slowly rise, they said.
That would devastate the agricultural industry and force Britain to rely more and more on imported food.
The predictions came as the Government launched the big- gest study yet into how global warming will change our lives.
For the next two years, scientists will study the likely effects of climate change on East Anglia and the North-West. A full UK study will follow.
Although a handful of scientists still refuse to accept that greenhouse gases from industry and cars are warming the planet, almost all agree global temperatures are rising.
The world is predicted to become 3.5c warmer over the next century, causing ice caps to melt and sea levels to rise by 20 inches.
The higher waters will flood parts of Britain's low-lying coastlines and put the fenlands and farms of East Anglia at risk.
'Salt intrusion could be an even bigger problem than rising seas themselves,' according to a report from the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions published to mark World
Environment Day. 'Half the UK's Grade One agricultural land is below the five-metre contour and much of it could become saline.' Scientists at Oxford University's Environmental Change Unit will draw up climate predictions for the entire UK.
East Anglia, with its flood risk, and the North West, with its flat Lancashire plain and high rainfall, will be the first areas examined.
Launching the scheme, Environment Minister Michael Meacher said Britain had agreed to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent of the 1990 level within the next 11 years.
'However, we mustn't forget too that climate change may also offer opportunities for businesses, such as the opportunity to grow crops previously suited to sunnier climes such as olives, grapes and sunflowers,' he said.
'Whether climate change represents a threat or an opportunity, there will certainly only be advantages to be had in being ahead of the game when it comes to being best placed to deal with it.' Some experts fear the drought of 1995-97 and April's records floods are the first signs of climate change.
Last year, one insurance company stopped offering cover to firms starting up in high-risk flood and storm zones. However, it has since changed that policy.

Canadians urged to reduce consumption of energy: [Final Edition]

Abstract: He left Wednesday, along with the 24 other distinguished Canadians brought together to assess the threat posed by climate change, convinced that the government must take immediate action. The panel, however, warned Canadians to prepare themselves for higher energy costs since any action to seriously reduce greenhouse gases will likely raise the cost of fuel. "Even if we have tradable greenhouse gas emission permits, that will have the effect of putting a cost on the release of carbon dioxide. So one way or another, anything that releases carbon dioxide will have to cost more." [Stuart Smith] said Canadians concerned about the cost of taking action should heed the lesson of the Titanic.

Full text: OTTAWA - Physicist Colin Franklin joined the National Forum on Climate Change as a skeptic, believing the dangers of global warming to be greatly exaggerated.
He left Wednesday, along with the 24 other distinguished Canadians brought together to assess the threat posed by climate change, convinced that the government must take immediate action.
"I guess I got converted," Franklin said in an interview. "There's a lot of evidence that the majority of scientists throughout the world think this is a problem.
"And from the point of view of precautionary action, from the point of view of insurance, I was convinced there's a need to take action now."
The citizens' panel, composed mostly of Order-of-Canada recipients, issued a declaration Wednesday that calls for urgent action by government, industry and individuals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
"Canadians have little to lose and everything to gain by taking action immediately. Each of us can and must make a difference," the declaration says.
The panel, however, warned Canadians to prepare themselves for higher energy costs since any action to seriously reduce greenhouse gases will likely raise the cost of fuel.
When burned, coal, oil and gasoline produce carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that most scientists believe is responsible for trapping heat inside the earth's atmosphere.
Natural Resources Minister Ralph Goodale told reporters he remains unconvinced that energy prices will have to rise during the fight against greenhouse gases, provided the country uses market instruments to keep costs low.
But Dr. Stuart Smith, chair of the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, said higher energy prices are inevitable if climate change is to be addressed.
"Even if we have tradable greenhouse gas emission permits, that will have the effect of putting a cost on the release of carbon dioxide. So one way or another, anything that releases carbon dioxide will have to cost more." Smith said Canadians concerned about the cost of taking action should heed the lesson of the Titanic.
"If we think those are icebergs out there, we'd better start steering now," he said, "because if we wait until we're 100-per- cent sure, we won't be able to steer away fast enough."
The panel urged Canadians to reduce energy consumption by taking public transit and better insulating their homes.

The citizens' panel, composed mostly of Order-of-Canada recipients, issued a declaration Wednesday that calls for urgent action by government, industry and individuals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Canada agreed in Kyoto, Japan, to reduce its emissions by six per cent over 1990 levels by 2008-2012.

Agreed to reduction

"Canadians have little to lose and everything to gain by taking action immediately. Each of us can and must make a difference," the declaration says.

Diverse backgrounds
The round-table brought together 25 Canadians from diverse backgrounds -- people like dancer Frank Augustyn, Olympian Linda Thom and country singer Hank Smith -- to examine for three months the issue of climate change from the vantage point of the average citizen. They heard from climate experts, business executives and dissenting scientists.
Although at times overwhelmed by the complexity of the issue, the panel decided on what Smith calls a balanced, pragmatic, Canadian- type approach:
"They're saying we don't know for sure, but we have enough evidence that we have to start acting upon it now."
Both environmentalists and oil industry representatives applauded the citizens' efforts.
Elizabeth May, director of the Sierra Club of Canada, said she was pleased unbiased Canadians heard all the evidence.
Dee Parkinson-Marcous, president of Ensyn Energy Corp., said the energy industry accepts the careful, balanced that is being advocated by the panel.

The panel urged Canadians to reduce energy consumption by using public transit, bicycles and better insulating their homes. And it called on the federal government to establish a National Atmospheric Fund, modeled after the successful fund in Toronto that invests in energy-efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction projects.

But Dr. Stuart Smith, chair of the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, said higher energy prices are inevitable if climate change is to be addressed.
"Even if we have tradable greenhouse gas emission permits, that will have the effect of putting a cost on the release of carbon dioxide. So one way or another, anything that releases carbon dioxide will have to cost more." The citizens' panel said important uncertainties remain about the science of climate change, but those cannot be used to justify inaction.
Mr. Smith said Canadians concerned about the cost of taking action should heed the lesson of the Titanic.
"If we think those are icebergs out there, we'd better start steering now," he said, "because if we wait until we're 100-per- cent sure, we won't be able to steer away fast enough." The round- table brought together 25 Canadians from diverse backgrounds -- people like dancer Frank Augustyn, Olympian Linda Thom and country singer Hank Smith -- to examine for three months the issue of climate change from the vantage point of an average citizen. They heard from climate experts, business executives and dissenting scientists.
Both environmentalists and oil industry representatives applauded the citizens' efforts.
Elizabeth May, director of the Sierra Club of Canada, said she was pleased that unbiased Canadians decided "we have to act now."
Dee Parkinson-Marcous, president of Ensyn Energy Corp., said the energy industry accepts the careful, balanced approach advocated by the panel.
The panel urged Canadians to reduce energy consumption by using public transit, bicycles and better insulating their homes. And it called on the federal government to establish a National Atmospheric Fund, modeled after the successful fund in Toronto that invests in energy-efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction projects.
More drastic action, the panel said, should only be undertaken after a thorough examination of economic costs.

Abstract: The group characterizes Canada's commitment at the Kyoto, Japan, conference on climate change last December to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 by 6 per cent below 1990 levels as "a crucial first effort to move the global economy in the right direction." Canada is already emitting far more greenhouse gases than it did in 1990 so the real reduction will be somewhere between 20 per cent and 25 per cent, the group says.

Urgent action needed on climate, national forum says
Governments urged to ignore skepticism, work to avert effects of global warming
Wednesday, June 3, 1998
Parliamentary Bureau Chief
OTTAWA -- A forum of eminent Canadians brought together in the winter and spring to examine the climate-change issue will release a declaration today calling for immediate and urgent action.
The so-called national forum on climate change, largely composed of Order-of-Canada recipients, says it has been convinced that the balance of scientific evidence supports the view that global warming poses a real threat.
Its declaration acknowledges the existence of scientific and economic uncertainty and states that skeptical voices could be correct and must continue to be heard. The group expresses its own concerns about limitations in the computer models used to predict the seriousness of climate change and the costs of action.
But it rejects these uncertainties as an excuse for inaction.
If the challenge is as serious as many scientists believe, the group says, early action will help build momentum for the difficult adjustments that may be necessary.
On the other hand, if concerns about climate change turn out to be overstated, Canadians can adjust their response down the road. They will have taken out a measure of insurance and will reap side benefits, such as reduced pollution, better urban air quality and a more efficient economy.
"Canadians have little to lose and everything to gain by taking action immediately," the declaration says.
The group characterizes Canada's commitment at the Kyoto, Japan, conference on climate change last December to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 by 6 per cent below 1990 levels as "a crucial first effort to move the global economy in the right direction." Canada is already emitting far more greenhouse gases than it did in 1990 so the real reduction will be somewhere between 20 per cent and 25 per cent, the group says.
It suggests that many immediate steps can be taken to respond to the Kyoto commitment. "However, action to fully meet the terms of the agreement should be taken after thorough economic cost analysis and should be coupled with policies that address any negative impacts on Canadian communities."
The group concedes that an effective climate change response will likely mean higher energy costs for Canadians. It says that any increases to government revenues from these higher costs must be used to reduce the effects of global warming.
The declaration calls on federal and provincial governments to create a National Atmospheric Fund to provide seed money for climate change research, education and action, including support for the development of new energy technologies.
The declaration says that the group's 25 members came to the issue with an open mind.
While climate change could lead to some benefits, such as longer growing seasons, the forum finds the dangers more compelling.
It lists some of these as more frequent and severe storms along the lines of those leading to the Saguenay floods in July of 1996, Red River flooding in spring of 1997 and the 1998 ice storms; longer and more severe summer heat waves, and changes in precipitation patterns that could exacerbate droughts on the Prairies.

Top scientist denies threat of global warming : A former head of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences is making waves by arguing that climate change may be beneficial -- so the U.S. should reject proposals for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.: [Final Edition]

Abstract: He's the former head of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences who, earlier this year, circulated a petition urging the U.S. government to reject the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which calls for major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the next 15 years. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences also entered the fray. The most influential organization of scientists in the U.S. issued a news release expressing concern over "confusion caused by a petition being circulated via letter from a former president of this Academy." "The NAS Council would like to make it clear that this petition has nothing to do with the National Academy of Sciences and that the manuscript was not published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences or in any other peer-reviewed journal," the NAS says. "The petition does not reflect the conclusions of expert reports of the Academy."

Full text: Who is Frederick Seitz and why is he causing such a commotion over global climate change in the U.S.?
He's the former head of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences who, earlier this year, circulated a petition urging the U.S. government to reject the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which calls for major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the next 15 years.
The petition claims there is no convincing evidence that climate will be catastrophically altered " in the foreseeable future," and that there is substantial evidence that greater carbon dioxide concentrations are beneficial. By late April 1998, his supporters claimed more than 15,000 scientists had signed the petition.
Unfortunately for Seitz and his supporters, some of the names on the mail-in petition turned out to be bogus. They included Perry Mason, Michael J. Fox, Drs. Frank Burns, Honeycutt and Pierce, the trio from the TV show M*A*S*H, and even Geraldine Halliwell, better known as Ginger Spice, a member of the Spice Girls music group until recently.
The U.S. National Academy of Sciences also entered the fray. The most influential organization of scientists in the U.S. issued a news release expressing concern over "confusion caused by a petition being circulated via letter from a former president of this Academy."
The academy pointed out that the mailing included a "manuscript in a format that is nearly identical to that of scientific articles published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
"The NAS Council would like to make it clear that this petition has nothing to do with the National Academy of Sciences and that the manuscript was not published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences or in any other peer-reviewed journal," the NAS says. "The petition does not reflect the conclusions of expert reports of the Academy."
Referring to a 1991-92 NAS study on this issue called Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming, the academy said "even given the considerable uncertainties in our knowledge of the relevant phenomena, greenhouse warming poses a potential threat sufficient to merit prompt responses. Investment in mitigation measures acts as insurance protection against the great uncertainties and the possibility of dramatic surprises."

Did you know that the hottest temperature ever recorded on earth was 57.7 C (136 degrees F) at El Azizia, Libya on Sept. 13, 1922? Or that the hottest temperature ever recorded on Antarctica was only 15 C (59 degrees F) on July 21, 1983 at Vostok?
All these extreme temperatures and more about severe weather can be found at <http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ol/climate/severeweather/ severeweather.htm l>, the web site for the U.S. National Climate Data Center.
Canada gets two entries on the list of climate extremes by continent.
The coldest recorded in North America was --63.3 C (--81.4 degrees F) at Snag, Yukon on Feb. 3, 1947 and the highest average annual precipitation for North America is at Henderson Lake where during the past 14 years, it has averaged 650.24 cm (256 inches) of rain.
The driest place on earth is Arica, Chile where, on average for each of the past 59 years, only .07 cm (0.03 inches) of rain has fallen annually.

Full text:   Gregory Wright lives in Sherman Oaks and is a member of the Campaign on Auto Pollution & Efficiency, headquartered at the International Center for Technology Assessment, Washington, D.C. Readers can write to him in care of Daily News Opinions, P.O. Box 4200, Woodland Hills, CA 91365-4200.
HERE are some ways to reduce road rage (Daily News Drive section, May 11). (Bonus: Many of these measures will also reduce America's disproportionately high per capita contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions.
Increase the fuel economy of all U.S.-manufactured and imported vehicles by raising the corporate average fuel economy (C.A.F.E.) standards immediately, thereby ending the trend toward "faster and bigger" cars rightly fingered as a major source of the phenomenal recent increase in aggressive driving and road rage. Such driving, not surprisingly, stirs up in other drivers. The ridiculously overpowered cars on the road today are an automatic major source of the road rage phenomenon.
Support the long-proposed global "carbon tax" to provide incentive to reduce fossil-fuel use and help fund the many measures needed to transition the world from the fossil-fuel age and avert the worst consequences of global warming.
Institute a pay-at-the-pump state auto insurance program as a major supplement to (if not eventual replacement of) private auto insurance. This innovation will require all drivers automatically to pay for their car insurance, or some portion of it, and will require the drivers who drive "larger and faster" and more miles to pay more, in proportion to their increased gasoline consumption. (Out-of-state visitors also hereby will help foot the California car insurance bill.)
Encourage "green driving" to reduce fuel consumption, atmospheric and local air pollution, and high-fuel-consumption aggressive driving (all that speeding and rapid acceleration uses a lot more gas). That is, teach new and old drivers to drive moderate, fuel-efficient speeds (around 55 mph, the people's commitment to mitigating the U.S. contribution to global climate change) and to avoid excessive, pointless acceleration on surface streets and freeways. Also, set lower speed limits on sustained uphill runs on highways and freeways.
Experiment with "variable speed limits" to be read out on roadside digital speed limit signs that will temporarily and specifically lower urban-freeway speed limits, within a range of reduced speeds, when traffic has slowed further on. If cars do not approach jammed traffic at high speeds, the backward-spreading rapid braking of numerous cars can be avoided and the traffic can continue to move as a managed, slower-speed continuous "stream" (instead of driver- and car-racking stop-and-go), conferring easier driving, earlier arrivals at successive off-ramps and less pollution.
Enact laws mandating the placement of speed- and acceleration-reducing governors on the engines of the cars of convicted speeders and reckless and aggressive drivers. Consider mandating speed-reducing governors on all cars driven by more-accident-prone young drivers (under, say, age 25). And fund research into the perfection of speed- and acceleration-reducing technology for these purposes.
No doubt some readers will feel some road (-related) rage at my suggestions. But the alternative is a tremendous increase in the travail and danger of driving as our population mushrooms in the years ahead - and in the terrible consequences of the relentless accumulation of carbon dioxide and other pollutants in the global atmosphere, conditions like the climate-change-driven disruption of agriculture and the food supply, the spread of tropical diseases, hotter heat waves, super storms, and the destruction of natural beauty. Not the world I want to live the rest of my life in.

Environment report slams Ottawa: An excerpt from conclusions of the report by the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development: [Final Edition]

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/environment-report-slams-ottawa-excerpt/docview/269899434/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Of course, this estimate was based on perceived need for the 1994- 1995 period. Since then, more regulations and laws, as mentioned earlier, have been added to the roster of enforcement duties, and still more are to come. . . Also mentioned earlier in this report was the extent to which operating budgets have been reduced. . . The operating budget (minus salaries) for 1997-1998 in the Quebec Region was $115,000; in the Atlantic Region, it was $150,000. Given the extremely limited enforcement budgets and the unacceptably low number of enforcement officers which must cope with an ever-increasing workload, it is not surprising that Environment Canada is favouring voluntary approaches and the downloading of federal responsibilities on the provinces and territories. As the Supreme Court of Canada noted, protecting the environment has become "one of the major challenges of our time." It also stated that CEPA's provisions respecting the regulation of toxic substances served a public purpose of "superordinate importance." It is imperative, in the committee's view, that the enforcement program be given additional resources.

Full text: Throughout this report the committee has stressed the importance of effectively enforcing Canada's environmental laws. Based on the evidence presented, the committee concludes that this is not happening.
Lack of political will might be partly to blame, but the major cause, in the committee's view, is the lack of adequate resources.
In (the committee's) opinion, the enforcement program is woefully understaffed.
There are in total 60 enforcement personnel in the regions and a further 22 supporting personnel at the national office of enforcement.
In contrast, an internal study, prepared in 1993, conservatively estimated that over 300 staff (full-time equivalents) would be needed for effective enforcement.
Of course, this estimate was based on perceived need for the 1994- 1995 period. Since then, more regulations and laws, as mentioned earlier, have been added to the roster of enforcement duties, and still more are to come. . . Also mentioned earlier in this report was the extent to which operating budgets have been reduced. . . The operating budget (minus salaries) for 1997-1998 in the Quebec Region was $115,000; in the Atlantic Region, it was $150,000.
As mentioned earlier, the one for the Pacific and Yukon Region, at $87,100, dropped by 72 per cent from the last to the current fiscal year due principally to the termination of the Fraser River Action Plan on April 1, 1998! The committee finds these figures alarming.
VACANCIES UNFILLED
Also alarming is the fact that enforcement staff vacancies have been left unfilled for so many years on end in some regions -- a situation that may be perpetuated in the years to come if, as is being done in the Pacific and Yukon Region, jobs are being sacrificed so that the savings on salaries can be converted into desperately needed operating funds.
Given the extremely limited enforcement budgets and the unacceptably low number of enforcement officers which must cope with an ever-increasing workload, it is not surprising that Environment Canada is favouring voluntary approaches and the downloading of federal responsibilities on the provinces and territories.
The committee wishes to stress that it is not against work-share agreements with the provinces and territories. Some have worked out very well.
One example, cited by the Canadian Institute for Environmental Law and Policy (CIELAP) as a very good model of co-operative government action, is the Canada-Ontario Agreement respecting the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem (COA).
Noting, however, that the success of this agreement was limited recently by budget cutbacks and the restructuring of the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Energy, CIELAP observed that even efficient, effective cooperative government action fails without adequate funding and coherent staffing policy. The committee agrees with this observation.
Adequate funding and coherent staffing policy are fundamental elements if the job is to be well done.
In the committee's opinion, the purposes served by effectively enforcing environmental laws like the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) and the pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries Act cannot be over-emphasized.
We are talking about providing Canadians with safe, clean air that they can breathe without being placed at risk.
We are talking about providing Canadians with safe, clean water that they can drink and in which they can swim without being placed at risk.
We are talking about providing Canadians with a safe, uncompromised atmosphere in which they can live without being placed at risk.
On a less critical but nonetheless important level, we are talking about providing Canadians with healthy, green spaces, rich in biodiversity, that they can admire and enjoy and hand over to subsequent generations for the latter's benefit and enjoyment.
If toxic and other harmful substances are not adequately regulated and kept in check . . . all of these vital needs and interests are imperilled and might be irretrievably lost.
That such might be the outcome must be resisted at all costs.
The public interest demands no less.
COST-ANALYSIS STUDIES
The committee deplores the fact that the cost-analysis studies prepared by the department do not fully take into account, in a quantifiable way, the
full benefits, whether health, social, ecological or economic, of environmental protection regulations for Canadians.
We appreciate that methodologies for conducting such studies might not be fully developed. On the other hand, we believe that, at present, too much emphasis is placed on the short-term economic costs of implementing environmental legislation, and not enough on the overall medium- and long-term benefits.
The committee can think of a number of factors that should be counted as benefits, for example:
- Benefits to public health and improved quality of life.
- Benefits in terms of achieving long-term "sustainable development" commitments and practices.
- Benefits to the economy generally (increased employment, research and development and export opportunities).
- Benefits to the regulated industries (increased productivity, decreased litigation costs, improved public image, level playing field, export opportunities).
- Benefits to insurance companies and consumers (decreased liability, greater risk management).
- Benefits to all levels of government and local communities (lower health costs, increased tourism and recreation activities, increased yields and decreased disruptions for resource-based industries such as fisheries);
- Benefits to all levels of government (improved international reputation, decreased vulnerability to environmental litigation).
Unless these and other benefits of regulatory action are considered, the committee fears that the emphasis will continue to be placed exclusively on the short-term economic costs.
This situation must be remedied.
The committee recommends that the Minister of the Environment direct Environment Canada to include the full economic benefits of regulatory action in all cost/benefit analysis made in relation to the development and implementation of regulatory solutions to environmental problems.
It is clear that increased funding is required for Environment Canada's enforcement program. Adequate resources are lacking at present; the problem will only be magnified in the future if Environment Canada is serious about fulfilling its statutory mandate to preserve and enhance the quality of the natural environment.
Environmental protection is of paramount importance to Canadians.
As the Supreme Court of Canada noted, protecting the environment has become "one of the major challenges of our time." It also stated that CEPA's provisions respecting the regulation of toxic substances served a public purpose of "superordinate importance." It is imperative, in the committee's view, that the enforcement program be given additional resources.
Having reached this conclusion, the committee was undecided about whether, in light of the existing fiscal restraint, the additional funding should come from reallocations within the department, or whether new, additional funding should be sought.
In the end, the committee decided that new funding for enforcement was needed.
The committee considers that the other core activities within the department, such as science, wildlife protection, biodiversity, meteorology and climate change, are too important in their own right and should not be emasculated in order to subsidize the enforcement program.
he department has lost over one- third of its budget in recent years.
All programs have been pared to the bone. The public finances, however, are now under control and on the road to recovery.
It is time for the Minister of the Environment to seize the opportunity, reaffirm her commitment to environmental protection and seek new money for the enforcement program.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
- The issue: A Liberal-dominated Commons environment committee released a report calling for an overhaul of the system, citing serious oversights, insufficient staffing and resources, and intergovernmental bungling. It recommends that the auditor-general take a look at the situation, that an independent enforcement agency be created, and that the environment minister publish an annual report of any findings.

Abstract: This is particularly so over western Canada where El Nino (warm phase) brings milder and drier winters, while La Nina (cold phase) brings colder and wetter winters. The super El Nino of 1997-98 produced one of the warmest (and driest) winters over western Canada (there were no major blizzards this past winter over western Canada) while the La Nina of 1995-96 produced severe winter and heavy snowfall over the British Columbia and Alberta border, leading to a major disruption in the transportation of grain and oil.

Full text: Re Weather worse than it used to be: Scientists (May 8).
The contention of Dr. Henry Hengeveld of Environment Canada that "severe weather events like hail, floods, blizzards, etc. have increased in frequency in recent years in Canada" is completely baseless.
As a retired Environment Canada research scientist, I can say that there is not a single study so far published in reputable peer- reviewed scientific journals that clearly documents such an increasing trend.
Hengeveld's assessment of severe weather events based on increased insurance claims can be very misleading, since more people have been buying insurance in recent years.
Furthermore, lifestyle changes have prompted more people to live near lakeshore (or seashore) areas, which are prone to floods and related natural hazards.
In a couple of recent studies, appearing in the peer-reviewed journal Atmosphere-Ocean, published by the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society, my co-workers and I have clearly documented that the warm and the cold phases of El Nino have definite impact on the Canadian climate.
This is particularly so over western Canada where El Nino (warm phase) brings milder and drier winters, while La Nina (cold phase) brings colder and wetter winters.
The super El Nino of 1997-98 produced one of the warmest (and driest) winters over western Canada (there were no major blizzards this past winter over western Canada) while the La Nina of 1995-96 produced severe winter and heavy snowfall over the British Columbia and Alberta border, leading to a major disruption in the transportation of grain and oil.
These dramatic changes in weather patterns from the 1995-96 winter to 1997-1998 winter were in no way related to "global warming" as claimed by Hengeveld.
Hengeveld should first publish his results in peer-reviewed scientific journals before making any claims of climate change due to global warming.

Full text:   Weather defines Canadians, says one of the country's best-known weather scientists.
Dave Phillips, senior climatologist with the Atmospheric Environment Service of Environment Canada, said yesterday that "getting Canadians to talk about the weather is like asking them to breathe."
But, after recent weather-related disasters, "people around the world are doing the Canadian thing -- they're watching the skies and they're talking about the weather, which is second nature to Canadians.
"The media loves to cover extreme weather," Mr. Phillips told his audience. "I call it porno-weather. It lends itself to hyperbole and exaggeration."
The author and creator of the Canadian Weather Trivia Calendar, was speaking at an Environment Canada forum on understanding and dealing with weather disasters.
According to Environment Canada, weather causes an average 220 fatal car accidents and more than 11,500 injuries a year. But, said Mr. Phillips, "We live in one of the healthiest countries in the world. More Canadians die falling out of bed each year than from weather."
Location is also a key element in weather-related disasters. The January ice storm wouldn't have been such a disaster, perhaps, if it hit 200 kilometres further east or west, said Henry Hengeveld, senior science adviser on climate change with the Atmospheric Environment Service. But it hit one of the most populated areas in North America and made headlines because it affected 15 per cent of Canadians.
He said the greatest weather disasters are often linked to a combination of unusual weather features.
The ice storm, he said, resulted from a series of moist air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, a warm air mass and an unusual atmospheric block in the east that kept these around for a prolonged period.
Last year's Red River flood was the result of a wet fall that saturated the ground, a high snowfall in the river's headwaters, a major snowfall in Manitoba in April and a moderate melt rate.
The number of individual factors involved in such major events increases the odds against them, he said.
The media play a part in public perception that weather is getting worse, Mr. Phillips said.
There's also "the CNN effect." When Galveston, Texas, was destroyed by a hurricane in 1900, between 6,000 and 12,000 people died, but it took two weeks for news of the tragedy to reach New York, he noted.
"That wouldn't happen today with instant news," Mr. Phillips noted. "This will be the third year in a row where the No. 1 news story will be a weather story."
He said when people view scenes on television like the Saguenay River floods, the Red River flood and the ice storm, they think climate is dramatically changing.
Scientists don't know whether this heralds a trend toward more chaotic, turbulent weather, Mr. Phillips said. "Or is it just some bad weather luck, a cluster of extremes that will go away and we'll be back to cold winters and warm summers in the future? We just don't know."
But, he said, "We're warming the planet at a rate faster and greater than at any time in the last 600 years."
As for El Nino, Mr. Phillips said, "we blame El Nino for everything, even things that happen indoors. Even the demise of the Toronto Maple Leafs. It's unfair. El Nino doesn't cause specific weather events, it causes a condition, a kind of a circulation upon which storms can be blamed. ...
"I do know one thing for sure. The number of weather-related disasters has increased, and that's because not only are there possibly more extremes, but people are causing disasters."
He noted that in the 1940-1960 period the eastern seaboard of the United States was hit by 18 hurricanes. In 1970-80, there were only two, so people felt safe in developing coastal and off-shore properties. Then came the hurricanes of the 90s and the resulting multibillion-dollar disasters as the new developments were hammered.
The costs of disasters are rising, he said. There's more property damage, people are living in more vulnerable exposed areas and so these weather hits are big blows today.
"So those extremes our grandparents lived through are now not just little weather hits, they're weather blows or disasters because of the society and infrastructure that we have and where we're living, in more exposed and more marginal areas."
El Nino gets blamed for everything and the world is getting warmer, so the public connects global warming and El Nino, he said. But scientists are only beginning to understand El Nino, although it has been known since the 1500s.
"You warm up the world, you don't necessarily get more El Ninos," Mr. Phillips said. "Scientists have a gut feeling that there is a connection. But they need the proof to have 99 per cent evidence that warming the planet brings more El Ninos."
Science can't say yet whether we're experiencing more extreme weather, Mr. Hengeveld said. "The world is warming, but we need another 10 or 15 years to say if there are more extremes, like floods and heat waves."
He said he believes the climate is changing. The world is warming and measures must be taken to do something about it.
"We have to say to policy makers that we can't definitely say this is going to happen, but there is a high probability and we should take out some insurance.
"We know the global climate is changing, regardless of what is causing it. We know it's changing from what we've seen over the last 100 years, and that is indicating we should expect weather to change.
"It's not a question of waiting to see what's happening and then change things. Society takes a long time to change, the time to start taking measures is now."
Climate change will change the pattern of weather around the globe and we should prepare ourselves today to deal with weather we're not used to, he said.
"Studies to date, although not necessarily conclusive, suggest the probability that big storms in Canada will increase."

LLOYD ROBERTSON: Natural disasters seem more and more common in Canada these days. And the experts are saying it's not just our imagination. Our climate is, in fact, warming up. And that's responsible for a lot of catastrophic conditions. So the question now is this. Is the warming trend just a blip in time or a phenomenon that's here to stay? CTV's Diana Bishop reports.
DIANA BISHOP (Reporter): An unusually warm, dry spring and a disastrous result for Alberta's forests. Fire, hail, twisters, massive flooding. It all gets blamed on the weather. Has the weather gone mad? Environment Canada says the country has had more weather disasters in the last three years than ever before.
DAVID PHILLIPS (Environment Canada): We used to think that we were somehow weather proof or immune to some of these disasters around the world and these are happening in our own backyard. So certain Canadians are wondering, in fact, is this a sign of the times?
BISHOP: So blame it all on the warming effect of El Nino.
PHILLIPS: We blame El Nino for everything that happens, even things that happen indoors are blamed on El Nino. Even the demise of the Toronto Maple Leafs have been blamed on El Nino and, so it's unfair.
BISHOP: El Nino definitely gave us a mild winter and an early spring. But experts say it's not the cause, just another symptom of the current extreme weather pattern that they attribute to a global warming trend.
HENRY HENGEVELD (Environment Canada): Climate change may increase the probability of El Nino type events. So I think it certainly is prudent to prepare for more frequent types of El Nino weather that we've seen this winter.
BISHOP: Because not only is the weather more chaotic, it's costly. Take the January ice storm. Insurance companies paid out a billion dollars in claims.
PAUL KOVACS (Insurance Bureau of Canada): The insurance community is experiencing much higher costs because of severe weather and we're very fearful that the increase we've had in the last little while is going to get worse before it gets better.
BISHOP: But will it? Climatologists don't know whether the severe weather is here to stay...
PHILLIPS: Or is it just some bad weather luck?
BISHOP: They'll know more if the cycle of disasters continues. Diana Bishop, CTV News, Ottawa.

Full text: Insurers cool on global weather
Tuesday, May 5, 1998
THROUGH much of this decade, the world's insurance industry has been fanning the fires of global warming. At the extreme, some of the largest firms in the business have sounded like Greenpeace campaigners bent on spooking governments into taking drastic action. Proffering statistics that appeared to show a dramatic increase in floods and storms, along with evidence of massive insurance losses, the industry mounted a major effort in support of the United Nations' greenhouse gas control program.
New numbers suggest the campaign was based mostly on hot air, although the early warnings appeared ominous. Climate change "could bankrupt the industry," said Franklin Nutter, president of the Reinsurance Association of America. Gerhard Berz, head of Munich Reinsurance's geoscience research group and one of the industry's leading climate hawks, said he feared climate change "will lead to natural disasters of unprecedented severity and frequency . . . so somebody better do something."
The industry's war on fossil fuels peaked in July, 1996, when 57 firms signed a United Nations Position Statement on Climate Change. It was a slippery document that hyped the global warming scare, downgraded market forces and pushed for "political initiatives." Man-made climate change "will lead to shifts in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. This will probably increase the likelihood of extreme weather events in certain areas. Such effects carry the risk of dramatically increasing property damage, with serious implications for property insurers and reinsurers." To prevent that risk, the statement invoked the treacherous precautionary principle (there's no proof, but let's do something anyway to be on the safe side) and called on the world's governments to "achieve early, substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions."
Greenpeace was never far from the insurance industry initiative. Greenpeace International's climate change director, Jeremy Leggett, played a major role co-ordinating industry thinking and disseminating apocalyptic scenarios. Mr. Leggett, whose main objective is a world covered with solar power panels, wrote a 1993 Greenpeace report called Climate Change and the Insurance Industry that foretold of insurance disasters as the world's climate warmed. The report was widely endorsed by insurance industry officials. "Greenpeace makes a good case," Mr. Nutter said.
The latest figures, however, throw cold water on the industry's alarmist forecasts. Insurance industry losses from natural disasters have plunged over the past couple of years, according to Swiss Reinsurance. After peaking at $26.3-billion (U.S.) in 1992 -- the year of Hurricane Andrew -- losses from natural catastrophes fell back to $4.1-billion in 1997, a level that's not out of line with recent history. Swiss Reinsurance commented, moreover, that there is "no evidence of the influence of climate change. To date, there is no general scientific evidence of any significant change in the frequency of events."
The spikes in the early 1990s were caused by an unpredictable number of high-cost weather and earthquake events that the insurance industry was simply not prepared for. But even Swiss Reinsurance said these events do not amount to a trend. "The observation period of 20 years is much too short to make any conclusive statements, given the extremely volatile claims burden and the big impact that single events exert."
It is now also clear that a dramatic increase in natural disasters reported over the past decade may be a statistical development rather than a weather development. The increase in the number of events over the past decade can be explained by increased reporting in the media of storms and floods, greater population densities, industrialization and other factors unrelated to climate. As the chart shows, the number of man-made disasters -- fires, plane crashes and shipping mishaps -- increased at about the same rate during the same period. That suggests a change in the climate for collecting information, rather than climate change.

Full text: WORRIED ministers are spending more than pounds 1.6million to find ways to stop asteroids destroying the Earth.
It follows recent concern that a mile-long asteroid called 1997 XF11 was heading for the planet.
The Government fears a real-life version of Steven Spielberg's film Deep Impact, released here this month. The movie shows America gripped with panic as an asteroid hurtles to Earth.
Most of the pounds 1.6million will help pay for a European Space Agency survey craft to land on a comet called Wirtanen.
Scientists believe that may give clues on how to destroy an asteroid. They will also monitor thousands of objects swirling round the solar system.
The British National Space Centre said: "The risk is small but an asteroid could cause big damage, even climate change."
He said scientists had ruled out zapping them with nuclear weapons.
"That would probably cause more problems than being hit by an asteroid."
Industry Minister John Battle recently admitted: "We do not currently have the technology to deflect a sizeable asteroid."
A FOUR-pound meteorite crashed onto the roof of retired insurance manager David Lee, 57, at his home in Hove, near Brighton.

Finding the funds for cleaner air: [City Edition]

Abstract: Next week Secretary of State Madeleine Albright embarks on a mission to convince developing nations to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty negotiated by more than 150 countries to combat global climate change. Unfortunately, she goes without the one thing that could make it happen: resources. Climate is exhibiting increasing instability, and delaying our withdrawal from fossil fuel dependence may be extremely costly -- for our well-being and for our economy. In Kyoto, the community of nations agreed that burning fossil fuels an felling forests were major causes for changes in climate. Now we must focus on solutions and how to fund them. The Kyoto Protocol created a Clean Development Fund to stimulate renewable energy enterprises and energy-efficient technologies. But the fund is empty. Filling it would provide the incentive for developing nations to sign the treaty and enable development with new energy sources. With participation of developing nations, the US Congress could be convinced to support the treaty.

Full text:   Dr. Paul R. Epstein is associate director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School. Lewis Milford is director of the Clean Energy Group in Montpelier, Vt.
Next week Secretary of State Madeleine Albright embarks on a mission to convince developing nations to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty negotiated by more than 150 countries to combat global climate change. Unfortunately, she goes without the one thing that could make it happen: resources. Climate is exhibiting increasing instability, and delaying our withdrawal from fossil fuel dependence may be extremely costly -- for our well-being and for our economy. In Kyoto, the community of nations agreed that burning fossil fuels an felling forests were major causes for changes in climate. Now we must focus on solutions and how to fund them.
The Kyoto Protocol created a Clean Development Fund to stimulate renewable energy enterprises and energy-efficient technologies. But the fund is empty. Filling it would provide the incentive for developing nations to sign the treaty and enable development with new energy sources. With participation of developing nations, the US Congress could be convinced to support the treaty.
This fund could be used by nations to help jump-start "infant industries" until they reach "economies of scale" and create demand for their products and services. A large fund will be needed to move clean technologies into the global marketplace. But big problems warrant bold solutions.
Can the magnitude of funds necessary be raised? Recently more than $100 billion was raised for East Asian financial bailouts, much in the form of guarantees that may never be used. The purpose is to create confidence. Why can we not raise a comparable fund for a problem that could have dire consequences for all?
There are several options for building a Clean Development Fund. One proposal is to levy the approximately $1.5 trillion exchanged daily on the world's currency markets. A 0.1 percent tarriff -- one dime set aside for each $100 exchanged -- would generate some $300 billion annually. Several pennies on each $100 -- a small fee for using the global commons -- might be a pilot.
Yale University economist and Nobel winner James Tobin proposed a 1 percent tax on financial transactions in 1972 ($18 billion daily at the time) to reduce short-term speculation and stabilize currency markets. The "Tobin tax" -- the burden spread across the financial landscape -- could serve to limit the kind of speculation that contributed to Asia's financial ills, and generate a public goods fund and global insurance policy for our common future.
Are there models for such funds? Yes, existing clean energy mechanisms are in place. Already the World Bank has established the Solar Development Corp. and the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund to finance new, less polluting power projects in the developing world.Will an international fund threaten national sovereignty? Not if funds are disbursed through established national credit agencies and nations set their own expenditure priorities, within agreed upon global objectives.
A new international financial framework -- a network of existing credit institutions -- is needed to manage the economic mechanisms that drive the energy transition. Combining private financial institutions for implementation with public accountability is key.
In Massachusetts, a renewable investment fund of $150 million over 5 years will be managed by the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative. This fund -- using an economic development approach to clean power -- can help companies seeking local and export markets for new technologies. Such local funds can be part of utility restructuring or create as stand-alone initiatives.
Nationally, President Clinton has proposed a $6.3 billion "Credit for Early Action" program over 5 years, including substantial tax incentives (e.g., a $3,000 break for buying an energy efficient car). The Big Three automakers have called for new subsidies and government programs, such as electric-car charging stations to aid the process.
The full spectrum of local, national and international funds can help overcome barriers to developing, distributing and using low carbon emitting technologies, and generate a historic opportunity to establish the first links in a necessary chain to create clean economic growth. Coordinating these funds could lead to a "proof-of- concept" for managing the Kyoto Fund.
Moreover, individuals and institutions can examine their own energy use -- their sources of power and their efficiency. Switching from oil and coal to natural gas -- and wind, solar and fuel cells if possible -- will strengthen the demand for clean energy, while increasing energy-efficiency can generate immediate savings.
Eventually there must be an energy transition; the question is how soon it can be achieved. No process of transformation can rely on penalties alone. Incentives are needed to push and pull the process, to overcome the built-in inertia and incentives for nations to continue to abuse their environments.
Secretary Albright will undoubtedly hear from her hosts that financial support is needed to meet the new international goals. Building the Clean Development Fund called for in the Kyoto Protocol -- while using existing funds to finance early stage development of technologies that lower greenhouse gas emissions -- can catalyze a climate change solution with full and fair global participation, the economic benefits of which may surprise us all.

Full text:   Pundits, politicians and the press have argued that global warming will bring disaster to the world, but there are good reasons to believe that if warming occurs, we will like it.
Where do retirees go when they are free to move? Not to Duluth. People like warmth. When television weather reporters say, ``It will be a great day,'' they usually mean it will be warmer than normal.
The weather can be too warm, of course, but that is unlikely to become a major problem. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the U.N. body that has been studying this possibility for more than a decade) has forecast that the world's climate will be about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer and precipitation about 7 percent higher by the end of the next century. Most of the warming will occur at night and during the winter, the panel predicts.
Temperatures are expected to increase the most toward the poles. Thus, Minneapolis should enjoy more warming than Dallas. But even the Twin Cities should find that most of their temperature increase occurs during their coldest season, making their climate more livable. Over this century, summer highs have actually declined while winter lows have gone up, records show.
Warmer winters will produce less ice and snow, facilitating commuting and making snow-shoveling less of a chore. Families will have less need to invest in parkas, bulky jackets, earmuffs and boots. Department of Energy studies show a warmer climate would reduce heating bills more than it would boost outlays on air conditioning. If we now enjoyed the weather predicted for the end of the next century, heating and cooling expenditures would be cut by about $12.2 billion annually.
Most economic activities would be unaffected by climate change. Manufacturing, banking, insurance, retailing, wholesaling, medicine, education, mining, finance and most other services can be carried out in cold or hot climates. Some weather-related or outdoor services would be affected. Transportation would benefit generally from a warmer climate, with fewer slippery or impassable highways. Airlines would experience fewer weather-related delays in the winter.
Doomsayers have predicted that a warmer world will inflict tropical diseases on Americans. They neglect to mention that those diseases - including malaria, cholera and yellow fever - were widespread in the United States in the colder 19th century. Their absence here today is attributable to modern sanitation and the American lifestyle, which prevent the microbes from getting a foothold - not to a climate unsuitable to their propagation. It is actually warmer along the Gulf Coast, which is free of dengue fever, than on the Caribbean islands where the disease is endemic.
My research shows that a warmer world would be healthier for Americans and would cut the number of deaths in the United States by about 40,000 per year - roughly the number killed on highways.
According to climatologists, the villain causing a warmer world is the unprecedented amount of carbon dioxide we keep pumping into the atmosphere. As high-school biology teachers emphasize, plants absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen. Researchers have shown, moreover, that virtually all plants will do better in an environment enriched with carbon dioxide than in the current atmosphere, which contains only trace amounts of their basic food.
Warmer winters and nights would mean longer growing seasons. Combined with higher levels of carbon dioxide, plant life would become more vigorous, providing more food for animals and humans. Given a rising world population, longer growing seasons, greater rainfall and an enriched atmosphere could be just the ticket to stave off famine and want.
A slowly rising sea level constitutes the only significant drawback to global warming. Oceans will rise about 2 inches per decade, scientists say. The cost to Americans of building dikes and levees to mitigate the damage would be less than $1 billion per year - an insignificant amount compared to the likely gain of more than $100 billion for the American people as a whole.
Let's not rush into costly programs to stave off something we might like if it occurs. Warmer is better; richer is healthier; acting now is foolish.

Full text:   El Nino and global warming may be changing our climate, but there is no conclusive evidence to suggest the Atlantic is getting systematically rougher, an international ocean weather conference heard in Dublin yesterday.
Current conditions in the north-eastern Atlantic may be no worse than they were a century ago, Mr Vincent Cardone, a US weather expert, told representatives of the major oil companies, scientists and researchers at the Fifth Annual Metocean Workshop in Dublin Castle.
Opening the workshop, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Dr Woods, said several studies indicated that significant hydrocarbon potential existed in the Rockall Trough.
He recently launched a petroleum infrastructure programme, funded by the 16 companies awarded licences in the trough last June. As part of this programme, a budget of nearly (pounds) 5 million had been earmarked by a Rockall studies group - a reflection of confidence in the exploration work.
Paying tribute to the "spirit of co-operation" among the offshore sector, the Minister said he welcomed the development of a metocean or weather ocean strategy for the Rockall area.
Dr Woods said he expected a high level of interest in exploration licences under the South Porcupine Frontier licensing round, which will be awarded next year. Under the round, which closes on December 15th, some 40,000 square kilometres are available in a water depth varying from 2,000 metres in the east to more than 2,500 metres in the north-west.
The two-day workshop, which is sponsored by BP, Statoil and Shell, is being hosted for the first time in Ireland by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Marine Institute, and the Galway-based consultancy, MCS International.
Considerable research into climate change and the effect on the Atlantic ocean during the last decade had not come up with incontrovertible evidence, Mr Cardone of Oceanweather Incorporated suggested. This research had been prompted by growing concern within the northern European insurance industry, the offshore exploration sector and the media and general public about an increase in storminess.
Similar concerns had been expressed in North America in response to measurements of extreme waves made by calibrated instruments on data buoys, moored off the east and west coasts of the US and Canada. Much of the research had culminated in a project known as Wave and Storms in the Atlantic, which was now complete, he said.
One of the big problems was the variability of data, he said. It was virtually impossible to come up with a homogeneous marine data bank for wind and waves. Historical weather maps had creeping inconsistencies, and there was also a lack of consistency in marine reports of wave heights.
Most of the information recorded on ships was concentrated in the southern part of the North Atlantic, due to the location of the busiest shipping lanes, and was hampered by the fact that some vessels used anemometers and others used Beaufort systems for measuring wind speeds, he said.
Observational and storm proxy studies indicated that the storm and surge climate of north-west Europe had not systematically worsened in the past hundred years. Certain data also suggested that the climate now was no worse than earlier this century.
However, there is evidence of inter-annual and inter-decadal variability in the wave climate of the Atlantic margin, he said. Improvement in climate models would yield better information, but more studies were required.

Germany -- Campaign '98 --- Animal House: Will German Greens Be the Kingmakers Or Liability to SPD? --- Poised for Linchpin Role In Toppling Kohl, Party Rankles Nearly Everyone --- Marsh Birds vs. 4,000 Jobs

Abstract: Now, the party that fights for animals is poised for its biggest success yet. If the Social Democratic Party gets more votes than Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats in the federal election in September, the SPD will likely turn to the Greens to form a coalition government. The latest poll by Germany's Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, a polling group in Mannheim, shows the SPD leading with 43% while the Greens have 8%, giving the two a majority. Mr. Kohl's party and its ally, the small Free Democratic Party, have a total of 40%. The rise of the Greens -- from protest movement to kingmaker -- has profoundly changed Germany's political landscape in recent years. Now the country's third-largest political force, the Greens share power in five of Germany's 16 federal states, including its richest, Hesse, and its most populous, North-Rhine Westphalia. On a national level, their ability to rally behind a Social Democratic chancellor could be decisive in the opposition's hopes of ending Mr. Kohl's 16-year reign. But in recent weeks, the Greens have alienated the SPD, German business and even the public with an election program that raises doubts about the Greens' political judgment and, indeed, the likelihood of a stable partnership with the SPD. The agenda the Greens issued last month demands, among other things, a dissolution of NATO, a halt to German participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions and a tripling of gasoline prices over 10 years.

Full text: MAGDEBURG, Germany -- To save an endangered bat, Germany's Green Party blocked construction of a police station here. The Greens stopped a housing development in Hamburg to rescue a rare bird, and held up construction of a road along a Frankfurt riverbank for the benefit of some toads.
Now, the party that fights for animals is poised for its biggest success yet. If the Social Democratic Party gets more votes than Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats in the federal election in September, the SPD will likely turn to the Greens to form a coalition government. The latest poll by Germany's Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, a polling group in Mannheim, shows the SPD leading with 43% while the Greens have 8%, giving the two a majority. Mr. Kohl's party and its ally, the small Free Democratic Party, have a total of 40%.
The rise of the Greens -- from protest movement to kingmaker -- has profoundly changed Germany's political landscape in recent years. Now the country's third-largest political force, the Greens share power in five of Germany's 16 federal states, including its richest, Hesse, and its most populous, North-Rhine Westphalia. On a national level, their ability to rally behind a Social Democratic chancellor could be decisive in the opposition's hopes of ending Mr. Kohl's 16-year reign.
But in recent weeks, the Greens have alienated the SPD, German business and even the public with an election program that raises doubts about the Greens' political judgment and, indeed, the likelihood of a stable partnership with the SPD. The agenda the Greens issued last month demands, among other things, a dissolution of NATO, a halt to German participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions and a tripling of gasoline prices over 10 years.
In the land of no speed limits, the plan to boost gasoline prices to five German marks ($2.77) a liter -- from about 1.53 marks now -- sparked an immediate outcry. Public hostility was so strong that the SPD leaders feared the Greens could seriously damage their election prospects. Indeed, the Greens' agenda seemed designed to abet Mr. Kohl's campaign strategy of fanning fears of a so-called red-green coalition.
"The current talk of a grand coalition only aims to conceal that a Social Democratic victory would mean Greens in government," Mr. Kohl told a news conference Monday.
Fast to sense the danger of being linked with Green radicalism, the Social Democrats dismissed the ideas of their likely coalition partner as "nonsense." Their candidate for the chancellor's job, Gerhard Schroeder, declared the Greens "unfit to govern." And at a party convention Friday, he pledged that a government led by him would stay in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, continue to send German troops abroad and "prevent gasoline prices from becoming a source of new social injustice." The SPD is aiming to put more money in the pockets of low-income families and therefore cringes at the thought of a big tax increase affecting rich and poor equally.
Even the Greens themselves are now backpedaling on their most controversial idea. They plan to publish a new, trimmed-down version of their manifesto that will still include the goal of higher energy prices but not mention the disputed five-mark threshhold.
German industrialists, never big fans of the party, have grown increasingly anxious about the prospect of Greens in government. "The Greens are dreamers who have as much understanding of business as a tree frog has of algebra," says Ignaz Walter, president of the powerful German Industry Federation, or BDI.
A look the Green record would certainly frighten many a Chamber of Commerce member. The party currently is holding up plans to expand airports in Dortmund, Duesseldorf and Frankfurt. In Hamburg, the Greens are opposing plans to enlarge an aircraft factory that could bring 4,000 new jobs to a city with 13.3% unemployment.
To build a new plane for the European consortium Airbus Industries, Dasa, the aerospace arm of Daimler-Benz AG, wants to enlarge its existing Hamburg factory into the adjoining marsh. But the Greens argue that the site, a habitat for 200 species of birds and a rare aquatic plant, must be spared. In January, Hamburg's government of Greens and Social Democrats designated the area a nature reserve.
"The Social Democrats alone certainly wouldn't have done this," says a proud spokesman for the Greens in Hamburg.
The city says it is looking for alternatives. But Dasa says only the marsh area is feasible, and the Airbus consortium says it has other sites being offered by Seville in Spain, Toulouse and Saint Nazare in France, and the eastern German town of Rostock. Observers say the Greens' move makes it unlikely that Hamburg will win the bid for the plant expansion when a decision is made at the end of this year.
Two years ago, a factory in Dormagen belonging to chemicals maker Bayer AG set up a self-policing mechanism to safeguard against environmental problems. It was the sort of system permitted in other German states and endorsed by the European Union. But local authorities in North-Rhine Westphalia, where the Greens share power with the SPD, have refused to scale back inspections. Bayer and others complain of "administrative overkill" that stands in the way of competitiveness. They also dislike a continuing debate on new special charges for waste-producing companies.
"The discussion about extra charges and the extra financial, managerial and organizational burdens send the wrong signals, especially to foreign investors," the chemical industry group said last month.
One of the biggest problems for companies is the uncertainty that often results from political haggling between Greens and their coalition partners. In January, the state government in North-Rhine Westphalia nearly collapsed after a long festering row over the planned extension of a brown-coal, or lignite, mine known as Garzweiler II. Environmentalists are alarmed at the mine's impact on carbon-dioxide -- brown coal is considered a particularly dirty substance -- and its impact on local nature reserves. Proponents of the projects, which include the state's Social Democratic economics minister, say the Garzweiler extension will maintain 50,000 jobs and is strategically vital: Brown coal generates a third of Germany's electricity.
"The worst is the uncertainty," says an executive close to Rheinbraun AG and RWE AG, the two companies involved in the project. "If politicians banned brown coal, or slapped a hefty tax on it, then we'd know what we're dealing with. The problem is the uncertainty and the fighting."
The Greens' plans for governing also give industry little cause for comfort. Wolfgang Piech, chairman of Volkswagen AG, strongly denounced Green plans to raise the price of gasoline to five marks a liter. "That's an idea for the rich in big cities," he told the German magazine Die Woche, suggesting that urban drivers use less fuel and have more money to pay for it. "The majority of the population will be punished for where they live."
German airlines and tour operators are outraged by a recent Green demand to reintroduce taxes on jet fuel. A Green parliamentarian said Germans should be content to take a vacation by airplane every five years. That rankled the public as well as the businesses.
So far, the Greens are proposing only a modest increase of 10 pfennig a liter of kerosene, with a gradual increase to 50 pfennig a liter. "Ten pfennig would be conceivable, but anything more would lead to a massive losses in the industry," says Michael Iwand, environmental director for TUI, one of Germany's biggest package-tour operators.
Worse, Mr. Iwand says, the environmental merits of the tax are far from proven. The income from the tax would likely be used for budget gaps rather than environmental projects. Third World countries that greatly depend on tourism would suffer. And introducing the tax in Germany alone would backfire: To avoid German fuel prices, planes would fly detours or stop for fuel in other countries, boosting costs and harming the environment rather than helping it.
But Juergen Trittin, one of the Green leaders, says the party's program is far from being the "economic dictatorship" that industry makes it out to be. Industry opposes the Greens, not because they would make less money, but because the Greens would bring change and force them to adopt new policies. "They complained about catalytic converters, too," he says.
Even the vilified gas tax is grounded in economic arguments, he says. The proceeds raised from increasing pump prices can be used to cut employer contributions to social benefit programs. Currently, for every mark employers pay in wages, another mark goes to insurance, retirement and vacation pay. Employers' high contributions are one of the problems often cited in Germany's inability to make a dent in unemployment.
If the Greens spark so much doubt, anxiety and even outrage, why do German voters seem bent on handing the party a share of federal power? One factor often cited is Germany's political system, where a party needs only 5% of the vote to gain representation in Parliament. In the U.S., by contrast, "it's winner take all," says Betty Wood, who coordinates information for the Green Party USA. "If we had proportional representation, other people besides Democrats and Republicans would have a chance to win something."
In addition, the German Greens, despite their recent bouts of radicalism, have grown more pragmatic. Party leader Joschka Fischer stunned his own ranks a couple years ago when he abandoned the party's traditional pacifism and supported the deployment of German troops in the former Yugoslavia. Such concessions to Realpolitik, combined with an organization that has ensured at least a Green voice, if not always a victory, in state and federal politics, have helped put the party solidly within the political mainstream.
"Throughout the 1980s, the Greens have managed to build up a large group of regular voters," says Juergen Falter, a political scientist at Mainz University. "And through their relatively modest course in various state governments, they have won additional supporters, largely from the center."
Fundamental to the party is the widespread concern in Germany for the environment, even if it means paying extra for cleaner and healthier surroundings. The signs of this are everywhere. At a McDonald's in Frankfurt, drinks are served in reusable plastic cups. Cologne, Munich, Heidelberg and other cities have vast downtown areas off limits to cars. Bicycle lanes are ubiquitous. Public transportation is well-developed. A nationwide recycling programs takes in not only bottles, cans and newspapers but plastic packaging material.
The most famous example of German environmental fervor came in 1995 over Royal Dutch/Shell's plan to sink the Brent Spar oil-storage platform. While environmental activists elsewhere could muster only limited protests, German consumers -- fired up by Greenpeace -- boycotted Shell gas stations and forced the company to find an alternative. Indeed, a third of Greenpeace's world-wide income comes from Germany, whereas only 16% comes from the U.S.
Germans are said to care more about the environment because they can afford it. With their basic needs assured by a paternalistic welfare state, Germans can look beyond material issues. "People focus on what's highest up in their needs. In America, that's food, clothing and shelter and not climate change," says Kalee Kreider, an official with Greenpeace in Washington.
Perhaps the leading source of the Greens' strength is their strong roots among the country's baby boomers, the now middle-age generation that protested in the streets in 1968, formed Germany's peace movement in the early 1980s and embraced environmentalism as part of an effort to do the world more good than its parents had.
Formed in 1980, Germany's Greens first entered Parliament in 1983 on a strictly ecological, pacifist and antinuclear platform. Their speaker, Joschka Fischer, caused a scandal when he took his oath of office in tennis shoes. Beards and sandals were other trademarks of party members in the legislature. Protest badges were common, bras less so, and some members knitted and tended to children during legislative sessions.
Both pacifism and the environment were popular causes in the affluent West Germany of the 1980s when the Greens prospered, and they still are for large parts of Germany's first postwar generation. In addition, the Greens' idealism and their uncompromising views on issues ranging from nuclear weapons to nuclear energy are falling on fertile ground in a nation known for its perfectionism and dislike of political deal-making.
To many Germans -- whose parents' Nazi past turned them early against politics -- the Greens' ideals seem worthy and pleasantly removed from the political mainstream. In addition, the Greens attracted that portion of more radical, left-leaning voters who in other European countries vote for Communist parties. But in Germany, where real-life communism was ever-present across the infamous Berlin Wall, Communist parties never stood a chance, and the Greens benefited.
"Without the Iron Curtain, the Greens wouldn't exist in their current strength," says Mr. Trittin, the party leader.
At the same time, analysts say Germany has changed since the days of the Iron Curtain, and the Greens must still prove that they have changed also. At a time of economic hardship, analysts say, job creation now tops voters' agenda, not environmental concerns. The Greens aren't widely associated with having answers to the jobless crisis. They played hardly any role in the debate last year over tax and market reforms. And the end of the Cold War has given way to far more complex conflicts in areas from Rwanda to Yugoslavia that don't allow for the clear-cut positions of the 1980s.
"Many things that helped the Greens' ascent in the 1980s are beginning to hurt them in the changed climate of the 1990s," wrote Renate Koecher of the renowned Allensbach Institute, a private polling institute, in a recent study of the Greens. "Their distance from business, their skepticism toward technological progress, their distrust of state power, their educational zeal and their support for a militant protest culture."
In the U.S., those concepts never made big inroads in the first place. The American Greens can claim a municipal judge in New Mexico, a few county commissioners and a handful of other officials, most of which are in California. In the northern Californian city of Arcata, population 15,000, Greens control the city council.
In the 1996 presidential race, the Green candidate, consumer advocate Ralph Nader, won a mere 0.6% of the popular vote. Mr. Nader refused to run on the Green platform and turned down offers of campaign support from Green officials. But the Greens considered the campaign a success because at least they had made it onto the ballot, albeit in only 22 states.
Says Carl Lankowski, research director for the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies in Washington: "Germany has the Greens, America has the Sierra Club."

Abstract: JOEL GORDES, an energy consultant, believes that Connecticut's multibillion-dollar insurance industry has a choice: face possible financial ruin from losses due to more frequent and severe storms, droughts and wildfires or commit some of the industry's considerable resources to efforts to stem global warming. Mr. Gordes is a consultant to Dr. Jeremy Leggett, formerly of Greenpeace International, and now of Solar Century in Britain. Dr. Leggett began the discussions about climate change between insurers and environmentalists in Europe. Mr. Gordes now engages in similar discussions with Connecticut and other United States insurers, proposing products he feels would both increase insurers' bottom lines and reduce emission of climate-changing gases.

Full text:   JOEL GORDES, an energy consultant, believes that Connecticut's multibillion-dollar insurance industry has a choice: face possible financial ruin from losses due to more frequent and severe storms, droughts and wildfires or commit some of the industry's considerable resources to efforts to stem global warming.
Mr. Gordes is a consultant to Dr. Jeremy Leggett, formerly of Greenpeace International, and now of Solar Century in Britain. Dr. Leggett began the discussions about climate change between insurers and environmentalists in Europe.
Mr. Gordes now engages in similar discussions with Connecticut and other United States insurers, proposing products he feels would both increase insurers' bottom lines and reduce emission of climate-changing gases.
Mr. Gordes has been involved in energy-related work since 1975, when he was hired by a solar energy company in Waterbury. He was vice chairman of the Connecticut General Assembly's energy committee when he served as a State Representative from 1987 to 1991.
A lifelong Connecticut resident, Mr. Gordes, 51, lives in Colebrook. In a recent interview, he discussed global warming and the insurance industry. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. Why should the insurance industry be concerned about global warming?
A. The insurance industry is based upon stability of weather within certain types of boundaries.
There has to be an actuarial experience to be able to say, ''This is what the premium should be for this property in this place.'' If climate is changing, the probability of risk changes, and that's not good. There could be more flooding, hail storms, intense wind storms, intense precipitation events.
Some recent research from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says that climate change may make hurricanes worse. Brushfires could become urban firestorms if they come off the ridges and go into Los Angeles.
It's going to be erratic and volatile, and that's not a great situation to base insurance premiums on.
Q. What is the magnitude of losses from these kinds of events?
A. If Hurricane Andrew had hit a more populated and wealthy area, like Miami, it would have been a $50 billion loss rather than the $16.5 billion loss it was. If a similar event hit metropolitan New York, New Jersey and then went into Connecticut, it could be as much as $110 billion.
Q. Have insurance losses been increasing in the 1990's?
A. Of the 25 largest weather-related insurance losses in the United States, 21 have occurred in the past decade. There has been a remarkable increase in billion-dollar catastrophic losses. Two primary reasons are greater wealth and people building more in harm's way. However, even when you normalize for that, it appears there are other factors at work.
Q. With all the uncertainty involved in projecting the future of global climate, why should the insurance companies take this seriously?
A. Absence of certainty does not mean absence of risk. If you wake up at the end of the day and say, ''What if I'm wrong, what if there really is climate change?'' it may be too late by then to do anything about it. The insurance industry is the first in line to be bankrupt if climate change is real.
Q. What should the insurance industry do about climate change?
A. European insurers usually have staff climatologists on board. The United States industry, with the exception of Employers Reinsurance of Kansas, generally does not.
They need to start looking at the probabilities of what could happen. Then they can ask what they can do to help mitigate climate change that at the same time will increase their bottom line -- for instance, making their own facilities more energy efficient. They own tremendous amounts of property. It will make it lower cost to maintain, at the same time they are reducing emissions.
The other thing is reducing property-casualty losses through energy types of upgrades.
A few winters ago we had all the huge icicles, called ice dams, forming along the edges of roofs. They are caused by heat escaping from poorly insulated ceilings, melting the snow on the roof from below, the water running down over the unheated eaves, refreezing, working its way back under the shingles and causing water damage inside the home. Insulating the ceiling correctly and ventilating the air above it stops ice dams.
So here's a case where saving energy, which is saving emissions, saves future claims for the insurance industry. The insurance industry could say, ''We're going to give you 10 percent off your insurance for three years, if you will insulate your ceiling.''
Q. Did the insurance industry have a presence at the December global warming conference in Kyoto?
A. The European and Asian insurers certainly did, and they came out with some very, very strong statements calling for emission reductions. Even as far back as 1995, Lloyd's of London, Munich Reinsurance and Swiss Reinsurance were calling for reductions. The American industry has not been there.
Seventy-one insurers have signed a United Nations accord, pledging to consider the issues of climate change and other environmental problems in all business practices. Employers Reinsurance is the only United States company to sign.
Q. Have the European and Asian insurers been involved in encouraging energy efficiency?
A. They've gone even further. They've started to invest in renewable energy. Swiss Reinsurance has put money into a fund to help people in the third world with photovoltaics. There are a number of English insurers joining the campaign called Solar Century.
Q. Why can't insurance companies simply not insure vulnerable areas instead of trying to mitigate global warming?
A. Then you don't have much of a business. And you are going to have to have the insurer of last resort take over, which is usually the government. In the long run that usually doesn't work too well. Somebody has to pay somewhere. If you're an insurer, you calculate the risks and do your business. There are a lot of other tools they are developing to manage those risks, financial tools mostly, but that ignores what may be the biggest threat.
Q. Why can't insurance companies simply raise their rates as their response to global warming?
A. They have been doing that -- in Florida, in certain other prone areas. But remember, it's a regulated business, and the minute you start raising rates, people start squawking to their state senators and representatives and insurance commissioners. It's a politically driven process.
Q. Are there precedents for the insurance industry advocating social policy changes that would reduce risks?
A. Absolutely. What about the support they've given to Mothers Against Drunk Driving? What about seat belt safety and air bag safety? In one case they took some pension funds and invested them in businesses that created jobs for union members from whose pension funds the money came.
Why should insurance companies, if there is a solid link to climate change from fossil fuel emissions, be investing in fossil fuel projects? It's like a health insurance company investing in tobacco.
Q. What has been the response of United States insurance executives to your arguments?
A. They are, as insurers usually are, very cautious. They want to see more ironclad links before they begin to take action. However, a few are starting to make some statements, one that will be putting something in their annual report.
We've come up with certain reasons why the United States insurers have not followed in the footsteps of the European Community. The Europeans have more global exposure to losses. The Europeans do not have a massive disinformation campaign going on by their fossil fuel industry, as we do.
United States companies don't want to scare their stockholders and customers by saying climate change is imminent. Many also sell auto insurance. And one of the things we're going to have to do, if we want to stop emissions, is get a lot of people out of their autos.
Q. How important is this issue for Connecticut?
A. Connecticut's economy is still heavily invested in the insurance industry. Some statements were made by Republican State Chairman Chris DePino about how Democratic Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's support for climate change legislation and the Kyoto treaty holds a risk for him. I don't think the Republican chairman has reckoned with the threat that climate change could present to the insurance industry in his home state. So I think he's barking up the wrong tree.
