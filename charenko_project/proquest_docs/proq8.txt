Abstract: Global warming, environmental degradation and rising populations are likely to increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters, a Red Cross report warned today. The World Disasters Report said 1998 was the grimmest year on record --- with Hurricane [Hurricane] Mitch killing 10,000 in Central America, Indonesia parched by the worst drought in 50 years, and flooding affecting 180 million people in China. Natural disasters created more refugees than conflict, the report said. Declining soil fertility, drought, flooding and deforestation drove 25 million "environmental refugees" from their land.

Full text:   Global warming, environmental degradation and rising populations are likely to increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters, a Red Cross report warned today.
The World Disasters Report said 1998 was the grimmest year on record --- with Hurricane Mitch killing 10,000 in Central America, Indonesia parched by the worst drought in 50 years, and flooding affecting 180 million people in China.
Fires, droughts and floods from last year's El Nino weather phenomenon claimed 21,000 lives and contributed to an overall natural disaster bill of more than $90 billion, it said.
Natural disasters created more refugees than conflict, the report said. Declining soil fertility, drought, flooding and deforestation drove 25 million "environmental refugees" from their land.
The report warned of a new era of "super disasters."
"Everyone is aware of the environmental problems of global warming and deforestation on the one hand and the social problems of increasing poverty . . . on the other," said Astrid Heiberg, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
"But when these two factors collide, you have a new scale of catastrophe," she said.
The report pointed out that 1 billion people live in unplanned shantytowns and that 40 of the 50 fastest-growing cities are at risk of earthquakes. It said half the world's population lives in coastal zones, with 10 million at constant risk of flooding. About 96 percent of all deaths from natural disasters are in developing countries, it added.
But as the number of disasters increase, the amount of aid for poor countries is falling, the report said. Over the past five years, emergency aid funds have been slashed by 40 percent.
Insurance coverage also is shrinking, as the industry tries to protect itself against bearing the costs of climate change.
After suffering a number of "billion dollar" storms, many insurance companies now refuse to insure the hurricane-hit Caribbean area. In the case of Hurricane Mitch, which devastated much of Honduras and Nicaragua, only 2 percent of the total $7 billion in losses was covered, it said.
It urged governments to spend more on disaster preparedness. In China, a study showed that $3.5 billion invested in flood control over the past 40 years saved the economy $12 billion in potential losses.

Abstract: SWALLOWS arrive earlier in the spring, while oak trees and insects show signs of life much sooner than was the case in the 1950s, experts said yesterday. Details are unveiled in a new report, Indicators of Climate Change in the UK, in a bid to instill a sense of urgency among the public about the problem caused mostly by too much carbon dioxide from traffic fumes, in the atmosphere. Scientists from the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, reveal that spring is arriving earlier, oak trees are bursting into leaf sooner, insects are quicker to show signs of activity andswallows arrive sooner on UK shores.

It is firm evidence of changes in the climate - which scientists warn will affect our lifestyles including work patterns, holiday destination choices and investment decisions.
Details are unveiled in a new report, Indicators of Climate Change in the UK, in a bid to instill a sense of urgency among the public about the problem caused mostly by too much carbon dioxide from traffic fumes, in the atmosphere.
Environment Minister Michael Meacher told a London news conference: "Although I cannot emphasise enough the need for action globally to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, these indicators also suggest that we need to turn our attention to adapting toclimate change."
Scientists from the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, reveal that spring is arriving earlier, oak trees are bursting into leaf sooner, insects are quicker to show signs of activity andswallows arrive sooner on UK shores.
The period of 1988-97 was the warmest in central England since records began, with twice as many hot days (more than 20 deg C) per year as the long-term average.
Previous dry summers have led to poor health of beech trees, an increase in insurance claims for subsidence, reduced yields of root crops and later upstream migration of salmon.
Climate models have given some clues as to the likely behaviour of some of the indicators in response to global warming.
In central England temperatures should rise, while geographical contrasts should become more marked with Northern Ireland and Scotland becoming wetter and south-east England becoming drier.
Winters are expected to become wetter and summers drier.
Dr Tim Sparks of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology said his research into swallows is based on data from coastal observatories in Britain at Dungeness, Portland, Bardsey and the Isle of Man.
It shows the birds arrive three days earlier with every one degree rise in temperature.

Increase
The period of 1988-97 was the warmest in central England since records began, with twice as many hot days over 20C each year as the long-term average.
Sea levels in eastern Britain are increasing by 1.5 centimetres per decade and there has been an increase in the number of Thames Flood Barrier closures over the last 14 years.
Previous dry summers have led to poor health of beech trees, an increase in insurance claims for subsidence, reduced yields of root crops and later upstream migration of salmon.
Cases of Lyme disease, spread by ticks, have doubled since records began in 1986.
Climate models have given some clues as to the likely behaviour of some of the indicators in response to global warming.
In central England temperatures should rise, while geographical contrasts should become more marked with Scotland becoming wetter and southeast England becoming drier.
Winters are expected to become wetter and summers drier.

Abstract: When El Nino hit Indonesia, causing the worst drought in 50 years, it set off a chain reaction of crises which the report calls "super-disasters." The home rice crop failed, the price of imported rice quadrupled, the currency dropped by 80 per cent and forest fires burned out of control, blanketing parts of the country in heavy smoke. Fires, droughts and floods from El Nino claimed 21,000 lives, while the deforestation of the Yangtze basin in China contributed to flooding which affected the lives of 180 million people. The natural disaster bill for last year was more than $130 billion.

Full text: A record number of natural disasters last year caused extensive damage and drove more refugees from the land than war and conflict combined, the Red Cross said Wednesday.
Its 1999 World Disasters Report predicts that the developing world will continue to be hit by a succession of "super-disasters" because of human-driven climate change, environmental degradation and population growth.
The report, an annual survey of humanitarian trends, says events including Hurricane Mitch and the El Nino weather phenomenon, plus declining soil fertility and deforestation, drove 25 million "environmental refugees" from their land and into shantytowns around the fast-growing cities of the third world.
This represents 58 per cent of the global refugee population.
When El Nino hit Indonesia, causing the worst drought in 50 years, it set off a chain reaction of crises which the report calls "super-disasters." The home rice crop failed, the price of imported rice quadrupled, the currency dropped by 80 per cent and forest fires burned out of control, blanketing parts of the country in heavy smoke.
Fires, droughts and floods from El Nino claimed 21,000 lives, while the deforestation of the Yangtze basin in China contributed to flooding which affected the lives of 180 million people. The natural disaster bill for last year was more than $130 billion.
The report says 96 per cent of deaths from natural disasters took place in developing countries.
As the numbers of such disasters increase, for human-driven reasons, it is becoming harder to obtain insurance cover for certain areas, particularly in the poorest countries.
Hurricane Andrew, in 1992, drained one-tenth of the global insurance industry's reserves in one night, says the report.
The world's largest reinsurance company, Munich Re, says insurance losses in the last decade have cost the world economy nine times more than in the '60s.
After a series of billion-dollar storms, many companies refuse to cover the Caribbean. Flood losses, the most serious, are impossible to insure against in some countries.
"Who will insure the uninsurable?" asked Peter Walker, director of disaster policy for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The answer, it believes, is investing money in flood control and disaster preparedness.

Energy tax which will cripple industry: [1 Edition]

Abstract: The proposed Climate Change Levy is a typical example of ill- considered legislation with a potential to seriously harm our manufacturing sector both in terms of competitiveness and the resultant knock-on effect on jobs. This levy, or indeed to give it its proper name "Energy Tax" was introduced by the Chancellor in his last Budget under the guise of helping Britain, via the Kyoto Agreement, achieve its commitments with regard to greenhouse gas emissions. A GROWING number of Scottish Engineering member companies have calculated that they will be significant losers in this situation. We are being inundated with complaints as companies recognise how they will be penalised under this new tax. Already several companies have discovered that they will lose in excess of #100,000 per annum as a result of this tax and indeed one member company has identified that it will lose more than #300,000. To give just one example, Sheffield Forgemasters Rolls who have a facility in Coatbridge and specialise in the production of large cast steel rolls, have calculated that their energy bill will increase by #210,000. In return, they will receive National Insurance contribution reductions totalling #8,000, resulting in an additional overall cost to the company of #202,000.

Full text:   PETER HUGHES, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, says the Climate Change Levy is a threat to manufacturing
THE manufacturing engineering sector looks like slowly emerging from recession as companies throughout the country see a reversal in the downward trend of order intake, and whilst we are experiencing lowest interest rates for some time we are certainly not celebrating but we are more optimistic than we were a few months ago.
The Scottish manufacturing engineering industry sector includes many companies who are at the top table in terms of world class performance, a position they have fought to achieve and will fight hard to maintain.
Against that background, the last thing they need are further Government burdens.
The proposed Climate Change Levy is a typical example of ill- considered legislation with a potential to seriously harm our manufacturing sector both in terms of competitiveness and the resultant knock-on effect on jobs. This levy, or indeed to give it its proper name "Energy Tax" was introduced by the Chancellor in his last Budget under the guise of helping Britain, via the Kyoto Agreement, achieve its commitments with regard to greenhouse gas emissions.
Unfortunately, the proposals as they currently stand will do little to minimise these greenhouse gas emissions. Let me explain briefly. By placing additional cost burdens on British manufacturing, thereby making it less competitive, we will drive business into the hands of other countries who are less committed to environmental measures. This could in fact have the net effect of actually increasing the greenhouse gas emissions globally.
The Treasury claims that the "Energy Tax" in the region of #1.75 billion, will be revenue neutral, this supposedly being achieved via a 0.5% reduction in National Insurance contributions. The calculation is based on an increase of 0.6p per kilowat hour for electricity and 0.21p per kilowat hour for gas and coal. These extra costs are planned to hit the industry in April of 2001.
A GROWING number of Scottish Engineering member companies have calculated that they will be significant losers in this situation. We are being inundated with complaints as companies recognise how they will be penalised under this new tax. Already several companies have discovered that they will lose in excess of #100,000 per annum as a result of this tax and indeed one member company has identified that it will lose more than #300,000.
To give just one example, Sheffield Forgemasters Rolls who have a facility in Coatbridge and specialise in the production of large cast steel rolls, have calculated that their energy bill will increase by #210,000. In return, they will receive National Insurance contribution reductions totalling #8,000, resulting in an additional overall cost to the company of #202,000.
It is unfair to expect the manufacturing industry to absorb such increased taxes, particularly since they will adversely affect our overall competitiveness. It is pointless to have the Government claiming to be business friendly, claiming we need to be more competitive and yet giving us even more tax burdens.
The Chancellor has been known to lecture the manufacturing industry on productivity, although his figures are hideously complicated and far from convincing.
Such Government activities merely add to the workload of the hard- pressed manufacturing engineering industry which is already trying to come to terms with numerous pieces of workplace legislation emanating from Brussels and Westminster - particularly Brussels.
What really creates the burden for us is the fact that so much of the legislation is merely putting a bureaucratic gloss on what we in this country are already doing in the workplace.
Without doubt there are rare instances of bad practice, but the vast majority of our companies have a human resource policy which is either up to world class levels, or they are positively working to achieve this standard.
As soon as you start to legislate for practices which are currently being carried out then you load the company with costs in management time and in money.

Abstract: AN INFLUENTIAL group of businessmen has warned the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, that the Government's proposed energy tax will have a disastrous effect on Scotland's manufacturing industry. In an open letter to Mr Brown, published in The Scotsman today, five senior industry figures say that the imposition of the tax - officially known as the climate change levy - could result in manufacturing job losses north of the Border. Led by Peter Hughes, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, the body which represents that industry, the group protesting includes Iain McMillan, director of the CBI in Scotland; Alan Wilson, the chief executive of the Scottish Council Development and Industry; Douglas Millar, the deputy director of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce and John Carruthers, chief executive of Metcom, the foundry industry's representative association.

Full text:   AN INFLUENTIAL group of businessmen has warned the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, that the Government's proposed energy tax will have a disastrous effect on Scotland's manufacturing industry.
In an open letter to Mr Brown, published in The Scotsman today, five senior industry figures say that the imposition of the tax - officially known as the climate change levy - could result in manufacturing job losses north of the Border.
The powerful group says the tax, which is supposed to help the United Kingdom achieve its targets in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, will hit the manufacturing sector harder than other areas of business which do not use as much energy.
Led by Peter Hughes, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, the body which represents that industry, the group protesting includes Iain McMillan, director of the CBI in Scotland; Alan Wilson, the chief executive of the Scottish Council Development and Industry; Douglas Millar, the deputy director of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce and John Carruthers, chief executive of Metcom, the foundry industry's representative association.
Claiming some businesses will be hundreds of thousand of pounds worse off because of the tax, the five senior figures question the Government's claim that the GBP 1.75 billion raised will be redistributed through reductions in employers' national insurance payments to make the measure "tax neutral".
In the letter to Mr Brown, the business leaders argue strongly that the Government must change its policies.
The group says: "By making efficient British heavy energy users less competitive, they could lose orders to foreign competitors who are less efficient in terms of environment controls. This would mean that instead of improving the global emission levels, it would make them worse.
"In terms of job losses -which we in Scotland can ill-afford - we are already facing trading problems because of the strength of the pound, the level of interest rates and the current world economic situation. We do not need a further increase in taxation for this key sector."
Although the group says that business accepts the need to reduce greenhouse gas emission, as agreed at the Kyoto summit, they argue that the measures should be introduced in ways which do not undermine the UK's international competitiveness.
The letter, which has also been sent to Donald Dewar, the Scottish First Minister and John Reid, the Scottish Secretary, concludes: "Punitive taxation is not the way forward unless the government seeks to reduce emissions by reducing manufacturing output and employment even further."
However, Patricia Hewitt, the economic secretary to the Treasury, disputed the business leaders' claims.
She said in a statement: "The climate change levy will play a key role in helping the United Kingdom meet the tough environmental targets that we are committed to achieve. It will not increase the overall burden of tax on business, since the revenues will be fully recycled via a 0.5 per cent cut in the main rate of employer national insurance contributions and support for schemes intended to promote energy efficiency."
Ms Hewitt added: "The Government recognises the special position of energy intensive industries by setting significantly lower rates of the levy for those environmentally intensive sectors that agree targets for improving their energy efficiency.
"We will help conserve the environment and safeguard our competitiveness - as we are determined to do.
"Detailed negotiations are now under way with the sectors concerned. No decisions have yet been taken on the rates that will apply.
"We are determined to work closely with business on the detailed design and implementation of the climate change levy," she said.
However, the Government's explanation for the climate change levy did not impress Scottish opposition politicians who sided with industry.
John Swinney, the Scottish National Party's deputy leader, said: "The Government has hoodwinked the public and the business community over taxation. The Chancellor makes flash announcements about low personal and corporate taxation and then by the back door puts on levies like this and the fuel escalator."
David McLetchie, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said: "This tax is supposed to be eco-friendly, but is clearly going to do serious damage to Scottish jobs and business. The Government should urgently review this measure."

Abstract: Sir, Your coverage of the debate over the energy tax is failing to reflect both sides of the argument ("Labour MPs attack energy tax", June 14). The government is cutting tax on employment and wealth creation while penalising activities that contribute to climate change. This is good for the vast majority of British business, unfortunately no one has a vested interest in publicising the fact.

Full text: From Mr Chris Hewett,
Sir, Your coverage of the debate over the energy tax is failing to reflect both sides of the argument ("Labour MPs attack energy tax", June 14). The government is cutting tax on employment and wealth creation while penalising activities that contribute to climate change. This is good for the vast majority of British business, unfortunately no one has a vested interest in publicising the fact.
The funds raised from the climate change levy are being used to cut employer's National Insurance contributions, which will cut the costs of labour for services and manufacturing alike.
Government figures show that the number of energy intensive plants is only a very small proportion of UK industry. The government has also cut corporation tax twice since taking power, benefiting all businesses.
Industrial gas prices plummeted during the early l990s. This did not lead to chemical plants in Germany shutting up shop and moving to the UK but it did mean that investments in energy efficiency were delayed in this country because they were not cost effective.
Japan's steel industry is 30 per cent more energy efficient than the USA's, largely because of historic differences in energy price. The costs of moving manufacturing to a different country are large and often an improvement in technology will be a more cost effective response. This will be good for the economy and environment.

Abstract: OTTAWA - Low water levels in the Great Lakes. Freakish winds that rip off roofs in Toronto. Shrinking glaciers in the Rockies. Melting ice cover in the Arctic. Drought in Atlantic Canada. Declining populations of Pacific salmon. "Heat waves in India are causing deaths with temperatures soaring above 50 degrees Celsius. Killer tornadoes of unprecedented strength are being witnessed. Droughts plague much of the world, with unprecedented drought now being seen in Northern Mexico." For years there has been scientific debate about when it will be possible to detect the irrefutable "signal" of long-term climate change over the "noise" of climate variability.

Full text:   OTTAWA - Low water levels in the Great Lakes. Freakish winds that rip off roofs in Toronto. Shrinking glaciers in the Rockies. Melting ice cover in the Arctic. Drought in Atlantic Canada. Declining populations of Pacific salmon.
All these apparently separate phenomena are signals of a global change whose worst-case scenario has "not even been whispered to the public," the Sierra Club of Canada says in a report yesterday.
"The atmosphere is sending increasingly strong signals that we ignore rising greenhouse gas emissions at our peril," the environmental group says.
Last year was the hottest year on record and last July was the hottest month ever recorded, the report says.
"Ferocious storms destroying life and property have become a steady diet on the evening news.
"Heat waves in India are causing deaths with temperatures soaring above 50 degrees Celsius. Killer tornadoes of unprecedented strength are being witnessed. Droughts plague much of the world, with unprecedented drought now being seen in Northern Mexico."
For years there has been scientific debate about when it will be possible to detect the irrefutable "signal" of long-term climate change over the "noise" of climate variability.
Now even skeptics are admitting the issue is real. Studies released in the last month suggest rising temperatures are causing a decline of Pacific salmon and a northward shift in some species of butterflies.
The insurance industry just completed a major conference in Switzerland to discuss a dramatic rise in weather-related losses.
The Sierra Club mocked the federal effort to devise a climate strategy by setting up 14 different "issues tables" involving hundreds of "stakeholders" to discuss the issues.
Sierra Club director Elizabeth May blamed Prime Minister Jean Chretien for a lack of leadership, noting that Canada still has not ratified the Kyoto Treaty negotiated in December, 1997.
The treaty calls on Canada to cut greenhouse emissions 6 per cent from 1990 levels by 2008-12.
The most recent government figures indicate greenhouse emissions are well above 1990 levels.
The main source of emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels like gasoline.
Brigitte Nolet, an aide to Environment Minister Christine Stewart, said the government is confident it will achieve the Kyoto target.
Nolet said she did not know when Canada will ratify the Kyoto convention, but no other country has ratified it either.
Most computer simulations of global warming have assumed a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, but now scientists are beginning to look at a tripling or quadrupling.
The report gives federal and provincial governments generally dismal marks for their performance on environmental issues during the last year.

Abstract: The Confederation of British Industry is confident the government is rethinking plans for an energy tax in the face of overwhelming opposition from industry. Peter Agar, CBI deputy director-general, said yesterday that a substantial reduction in the impact of the levy appeared possible following meetings with senior cabinet ministers. "We believe there is now a full recognition that our concerns are well-founded and I am hopeful that the government is now willing to look for a more flexible approach in the final form of any climate change levy," he added.

Full text: The Confederation of British Industry is confident the government is rethinking plans for an energy tax in the face of overwhelming opposition from industry.
Peter Agar, CBI deputy director-general, said yesterday that a substantial reduction in the impact of the levy appeared possible following meetings with senior cabinet ministers.
"We believe there is now a full recognition that our concerns are well-founded and I am hopeful that the government is now willing to look for a more flexible approach in the final form of any climate change levy," he added.
Tony Blair is believed to have accepted the case put forward by the CBI and other industry organisations that the levy would seriously damage competitiveness.
But there is likely to be resistance to substantial changes from the Treasury, which sees the levy as a way of raising £1.75bn to reduce employers' national insurance contributions.
Mr Agar told an environment conference in Birmingham yesterday that heavy energy users would need a discount of up to 95 per cent on the levy to avoid damaging international competitiveness.
The government has offered a reduction of 50 per cent to some companies but the CBI says the basis on which ministers propose to select eligible companies means many intensive users would be excluded.
Heavy energy users say the levy is unfair because most of the revenue will come from industrial companies but most of the benefit of lower national insurance contributions will go to labour-intensive service companies.
There have also been complaints that a levy on energy use by companies will fail to curb domestic energy use and fails to provide a mechanism to encourage energy from renewable sources.
The UK has agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 12.5 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012. The CBI says business emissions will stabilise at 1990 levels by 2010 without further government action. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Energy tax threatens N Ireland plans for gas link: [London edition]

Author: Murray Brown, John

Abstract: The government's new energy tax is threatening one of the key economic objectives of Northern Ireland's Good Friday peace agreement, jeopardising plans to build a north-south gas pipeline between Belfast and Dublin. The climate change levy, the government's response to emission reduction targets agreed by the main industrial countries at Kyoto and introduced in the March Budget, will result in electricity prices in Northern Ireland higher than any region outside Japan, according to the Confederation of British Industry.

Full text: The government's new energy tax is threatening one of the key economic objectives of Northern Ireland's Good Friday peace agreement, jeopardising plans to build a north-south gas pipeline between Belfast and Dublin.
The climate change levy, the government's response to emission reduction targets agreed by the main industrial countries at Kyoto and introduced in the March Budget, will result in electricity prices in Northern Ireland higher than any region outside Japan, according to the Confederation of British Industry.
Douglas McIldoon, director of Ofreg the province's energy regulator, warned the tax "will be damaging to Northern Ireland's competitiveness and do little to reduce CO{2} emissions".
The CBI says the tax will add to business costs, make Northern Ireland a less attractive place to invest and runs counter to the government's environmental targets, because cleaner fuels like gas are treated the same as coal and oil. The CBI also says the tax will restrict the growth of an all-Ireland energy market.
BG, formerly British Gas, currently has a licence to supply gas to household and industrial users in Greater Belfast through Phoenix, its joint venture with Keyspan, a US company.
Chris Murray, Phoenix chief executive, said the economic case for a north-south gas inter-connector could be damaged. Keyspan has proposed forming a joint venture with Bord Gais, the Irish Republic's gas company, for a north-south link. But Bord Gais is understood to favour an undersea gas pipeline from Scotland.
Industry officials believe Dublin will opt for the cross-border option as this will further its political objectives of bringing the halves of Ireland together.
Northern Ireland already has the highest energy prices in the European Union as a result of the inflation-proofed contracts given to the generation companies at privatisation in 1992.
For small users, the tax will add 8 per cent to electricity prices, 15 per cent to gas prices. For large users, electricity prices will rise between 15 and 20 per cent and 40 per cent for gas.
Stewart Pollard at Dupont, the Londonderry-based US chemicals company and Northern Ireland's largest industrial energy consumer, said the proposed rebate on national insurance contributions would "nowhere near" compensate for the tax increase.
The tax is also likely to affect the economics of a gas pipeline to the north-west of the region. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: A GOVERNMENT measure aimed at helping the UK achieve its targets in reducing greenhouse gas emissions will have a "disastrous" effect on Scottish manufacturing and could cost jobs, industry leaders have warned. Peter Hughes, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, warned yesterday that manufacturing would be hit hardest by the Government's Climate Change Levy due to be enforced in April 2001, and claimed that despite the costs the measure might be ineffectual. The Government expects to raise GBP 1.75 billion per annum on the tax on greenhouse emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, but it claims that money will be redistributed through a reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions. It says that the intention is to make the tax revenue neutral.

Full text: A GOVERNMENT measure aimed at helping the UK achieve its targets in reducing greenhouse gas emissions will have a "disastrous" effect on Scottish manufacturing and could cost jobs, industry leaders have warned.
Peter Hughes, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, warned yesterday that manufacturing would be hit hardest by the Government's Climate Change Levy due to be enforced in April 2001, and claimed that despite the costs the measure might be ineffectual.
The Government expects to raise GBP 1.75 billion per annum on the tax on greenhouse emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, but it claims that money will be redistributed through a reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions. It says that the intention is to make the tax revenue neutral.
Mr Hughes said the measure was a tax on manufacturing industry.
"We have examples already of companies which are, by the very nature of their processes, high energy users who will be net losers of hundreds of thousands of pounds," he said. "These companies have worked to become efficient in terms of manpower and therefore will receive relatively little recompense in employers' National Insurance contributions."
Mr Hughes warned that by making British heavy energy users less competitive they could lose orders to foreign competitors who were less efficient in terms of environmental controls.
"This would mean that instead of improving the global emissions levels, it would make them worse."
The increase in energy costs outlined by the Government is 0.6p per kilowatt hour for electricity and 0.21p per kilowatt hour for gas.
Sheffield Forgemasters, which has a factory in Coatbridge specialising in the production of large steel rolls, estimates that its energy bill will increase by GBP 210,000 a year.
Another member company of Scottish Engineering, which operates in Livingston, anticipates that it will face a tax increase of about GBP 300,000 because of the "so-called revenue neutral" energy tax.
That breaks down to an increase of GBP 255,000 in gas costs and GBP 94,000 in electricity costs, giving a total increase in energy costs of GBP 349,000. The firm will receive in return GBP 42,0000 as an National Insurance rebate, giving an additional cost to the company of GBP 307,000.
Mr Hughes said that as a subsidiary of an American company, its costs were always being compared with plants in the US. He asked how the parent company would view this hike in costs.
"Once again we see a failure of government to recognise the importance of having a strong wealth-creating manufacturing sector," Mr Hughes said.
"The cost to the manufacturing industry will be spread across all sizes of company, with the undoubted result that some companies will be significantly less competitive," he added.
"This in itself will have a serious knock-on effect for jobs - which we in Scotland can ill-afford."
Scottish Engineering warns that the job losses will be exacerbated if companies decide they can source more cheaply in a country which has not signed up to the Kyoto Agreement to reduce the CO2 emissions and decide to place the orders outwith the UK.

Abstract: By 2010, 51 percent of local greenhouse gases will come from transportation, 33 percent from electricity, 13 percent from natural gas and 3 percent from solid waste, according to city projections. Since transportation is the primary source of greenhouse gases, the proposed plan urges the council to accelerate measures already outlined in existing transportation documents.

Full text:   Fort Collins looks at ways to cut greenhouse gases; price tag is $$@$!75M
The Coloradoan
The worldwide push to cut levels of carbon dioxide and other gases contributing to global climate change will soon hit close to home.
This week, the Fort Collins City Council will consider a "greenhouse gas" reduction plan developed as part of its commitment to the international Cities for Climate Protection.
If the council followed through over the next decade with all the proposals outlined in the plan, it would cost taxpayers an estimated $$@$!75 million and make driving an automobile more costly and inconvenient.
In return, following the plan would mean Fort Collins could get commuter rail to Denver, more energy-efficient homes, new recycling opportunities, more trees, less expensive solar technology, day care in the workplace and a smaller "brown cloud."
"In many cases, there are benefits beyond reducing greenhouse gas emissions," said Lucinda Smith, air quality specialist with the city's Natural Resources Department.
Despite renewed attention on greenhouse gases, their effect in the atmosphere isn't new.
Gases such as carbon dioxide and methane trap heat in the atmosphere and radiate it back to Earth - a process commonly referred to as the greenhouse effect.
But activities such as burning fossil fuels and cutting down trees are adding to this effect.
Left unchecked, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will double by 2050.
Though experts disagree over what that could mean, worst-case predictions include stormier weather, coastal flooding, increased heart and respiratory problems, disease outbreaks, food shortages and depleted water supplies.
Fort Collins and other communities have a responsibility to take action on this issue, Smith said.
"Cities are major sources of carbon dioxide," she said, "and they can be vulnerable to the costs of climate changes."
If weather gets more severe, for instance, insurance costs will go up, Smith said.
Cities for Climate Protection is encouraging its 290 members to aim for a 30 percent reduction of 1990 levels by 2010.
In 1990, Fort Collins produced 1.36 million tons of carbon dioxide, or 15.5 tons per person, according to city calculations. Without action, that number is expected to reach 3.5 million tons by 2010, or 24.56 tons per person, mostly because of increasing automobile use.
That's almost a 160 percent increase. Even implementing all the measures suggested in the 92-page plan going to City Council this week would not get local greenhouse gases close to the voluntary target.
"That would be aggressive for us," Smith said.
By 2010, 51 percent of local greenhouse gases will come from transportation, 33 percent from electricity, 13 percent from natural gas and 3 percent from solid waste, according to city projections.
Since transportation is the primary source of greenhouse gases, the proposed plan urges the council to accelerate measures already outlined in existing transportation documents.
Some are educational: encouraging people to buy fuel-efficient vehicles or lobbying state and federal governments to raise fuel-efficiency and emissions standards on new cars.
Others are more drastic: limiting parking, buying cleaner-burning buses, installing fueling stations for alternative-fuel vehicles and building commuter rail to Denver.
But funding for these sorts of programs took a major hit at the ballot box in April, when local residents voted down a transportation sales tax that would have raised $$@$!92 million over the next 10 years.
Ron Phillips, the city's transportation services director, said staff is looking at new ways to find money, but he knew of no official plans to introduce another ballot initiative - another recommendation included in the proposed climate protection plan.
The plan also highlights measures such as planting more trees to absorb carbon dioxide, offering reduced-cost fluorescent bulbs to lower residential power use, encouraging at-work day care centers to cut down on driving, making more pollution prevention help available to local businesses, improving waste water treatment processes and mandating recycling.
Eric Levine, chairman of the city's Air Quality Advisory Board, said the plan will put Fort Collins on the right track but may not go far enough.
"There's the concern that we may not be doing enough, especially as far as our efforts to keep our VMTs (vehicle-miles traveled) from going through the roof," Levine said.
The plan certainly doesn't need to limit local actions, nor does it etch anything in stone, said Susie Gordon, senior environmental planner with the city.
"It's just trying to get the community to start thinking about these issues," Gordon said.
Interested?
City Council will discuss the proposed Cities for Climate Protection plan in a study session at 6 p.m. Tuesday at City Hall, 300 W. Laporte Ave.
Highlights of the 92-page plan include recommendations to:
n Build commuter rail from Fort Collins to Denver.
n Limit parking around town.
n Expand the Larimer County Recycling Center.
n Offer incentives for "green" building practices.
n Increase the local use of wind power.
n Plant more trees.
n Lobby for higher fuel-efficiency and emissions standards on new cars.
n Install fueling stations for alternative-fuel vehicles.
n Complete a pedestrian/bicycle corridor along Mason Street.
n Improve methane-producing processes at the wastewater treatment plant.
n Make reduced-cost fluorescent bulbs available to local homeowners.
n Replace the standard incandescent light bulbs in traffic signals with an energy-efficient alternative, light-emitting diodes.
Council will vote on the plan later this summer. Additional discussions and votes would be needed to implement any of these recommendations.

Full text: The seas are rising, the atmosphere is warming and it is time for South Floridians to start preparing for some important changes, scientists warned at a conference on Wednesday.
The big picture for South Florida in the next century: Reduced supplies of drinking water, higher insurance bills for homeowners, more-frequent flooding of roads and yards in coastal areas, and storms that periodically demolish the region's beaches -- costing millions in lost tourism revenues.
These changes are likely to be noticed before today's children reach middle age, speakers predicted. But they need not be catastrophic if people start making plans now and reduce their use of petroleum-based fuels whose waste products are thought to contribute to a warming atmosphere, speakers said.
"If half of what they say about climate change is true, we have a lot of issues facing us that are going to cost us a lot of money," said Mike Farrell, director of the Center for Global Environmental Studies at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. "It's been said that climate is the granddaddy of all environmental problems."
The link between the burning of fossil fuels and the warming of the atmosphere that has been recorded during the past century has yet to be proven. But many scientists say the link seems fairly clear.
A minority scientific view attributes the changes to the natural variability of the Earth's climate. Even most of these skeptics, however, acknowledge that the globe's climate is warming, on average, and that the trend seems likely to continue.
The conference on Wednesday at the Wyndham Hotel near downtown Miami was sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to provide information for local and state environmental regulators, private environmental consultants, businesspeople, teachers and others. About 150 attended.
Beginning about 1930, seas began rising much faster than they had previously, said Hal Wanless, a University of Miami geologist. Since then, the ocean's level has increased by about 9 inches in South Florida.
"We're not even dealing with that reality as we manage our urban and natural areas: We are having a sea level rise -- and have for the last 70 years -- that is 10 times {the rate of} the last 3,000 years," Wanless said. "This is significant."
An additional 2-foot rise in sea level is entirely reasonable to expect in South Florida by 2100, Wanless and other speakers said. A small part of the increase is caused by melting glaciers and ice in the northern latitudes. But most of it occurs because the water in Earth's vast oceans, heated even slightly, expands.
The areas of the eastern United States most likely to suffer are South Florida, southern Louisiana, coastal North Carolina and Maryland, said Jim Titus, head of the EPA's sea level rise project.
Of the three, Florida is best off. People here already are subject to flooding from tropical storms and hurricanes and have consequently been more careful about building in low-lying areas, Titus said.
However, a rising sea is bound to reduce South Florida's drinking- water supplies, Titus said, as salt water surges inland underground, ruining large parts of the aquifer from which water is drawn. Also, large portions of the freshwater Everglades will be turned salty.
And hundreds of millions of dollars will be required to retrofit the region's water-control system, elevate streets, improve drainage, raise homes and perform similar tasks, Titus said. "The Everglades are really at risk. Your water supply is in trouble and your infrastructure is going to need a lot of work," Titus said. "But, hey, let's look at the bright side: You have decades to prepare."
As seas rise, hurricanes will be more damaging to the coastline, speakers predicted. More than one-quarter of the $200 million in damages Hurricane Georges did in the Florida Keys resulted from flooding -- which is bound to accelerate as the seas rise, said Melinda Harris, an economist who studied South Florida for the EPA.
Tourists spend $3.2 million a day in the Keys, which were closed for 10 days, costing roughly $32 million in lost revenues. Had Georges hit Miami Beach, where visitors plunk down $4.4 million a day, the losses would have been even worse, she said.
In pockets throughout South Florida, homeowners in zones that are not currently considered prone to floods will find themselves reclassified and facing big hikes in their insurance costs, Harris said. With three-quarters of the United States' population living within an hour's drive of the coast, the problem is not confined to South Florida, speakers said.
"Folks, this is going to happen," Titus said. "The sea is going to rise. Do we deal with it today, or pass it on to the next generation?"

Expert sounds warning on El Nino
Economic impact of climatic abnormalities could be grave, conference told
Tuesday, May 25, 1999
Science Reporter
Banff, Alta. -- El Nino, the patron saint of weird weather, has been showing up more often and with greater intensity since 1976, says a scientist who has studied corals and ocean temperatures in an effort to unlock the history of the Southern oscillation.
The Southern oscillation -- the seesawing of atmospheric pressure between the eastern and western halves of the Pacific Ocean -- corresponds to a marked increase in global temperatures and concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but Harvard University professor Dan Schrag is loath to link global warming to El Nino.
Although scientists don't have enough data to prove climate change is responsible for a more intense El Nino, Dr. Schrag told members of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research on the weekend he predicted future oscillations would have grave social and economic impacts.
"Let me put it this way: If I was an insurance company and I had to perceive this problem in terms of risk, I'd be extremely worried," he told more than 200 scientists there for an update on the CIAR's earth-system-evolution program.
El Nino, which usually occurs every three to seven years, refers to an abnormally warm patch of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru.
It affects weather around the globe, usually turning it upside down. The El Nino of 1982-1983 was considered "truly a traumatic event" that caused billions of dollars worth of damage. And the world experienced an even bigger one last year that caused droughts in southeast Asia and rain in Peru, where people perished from landslides caused by the downpours.
Add to that another strong oscillation in 1987 and an almost persistent El Nino event in the mid-1990s, and Dr. Schrag said it's "a string of behaviour" that points to a statistically significant deviation.
It's a hotly debated topic, but most scientists agree that 23 years represents too short a time to allow accurate analysis.
Dr. Schrag's approach was to study corals, organisms that grow in one place in the surface water for a long time, from both sides of the Pacific. He took core samples from living colonies and examined fossils, both of which contained bands like the growth rings in trees that tell their age. He also analyzed the chemistry of the coral skeletons, made of calcium carbonate, for a naturally occurring radioisotope of carbon called carbon-14. It is actually produced in the atmosphere, but invades the surface of the ocean through gas exchange. The C-14 is then taken into deeper water, where it is found at lower concentrations.
The differing concentrations of C-14 found in the corals and a corresponding increase in the sea-surface temperature led the Harvard geochemist to the thermocline, the layer of water between the ocean's surface and deeper, colder water.
Normally the deeper cold water wells up to the surface and mixes there, cooling off the top layer of sea water.
But Dr. Shrag thinks the thermocline deepened in 1976 in the east, but not in the west, trapping cold water that normally wells up from the depths.
The significance of this is that the warm water at the surface leads to a more intense El Nino.

Lydia Dotto takes us on a timely guided tour through the brave new world we have made for ourselves: the era of violent weather. As long ago as 1895, Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius suggested that human activities might warm the atmosphere. Combustion creates carbon dioxide, a gas that traps heat. Other heat-trapping gases have joined the list since then, notably methane and nitrous oxide. Dotto's Storm Warning takes up the story there. She writes: "There's virtually no question that the earth's surface temperature has increased about 0.50 C over the past century."
Earth's atmosphere is a vast heat engine, with hot air rising over the tropics, pushing north and south, cooling as it moves toward the poles. Allowing for the Earth's rotation, the result is a series of heat-powered convection currents. If global warming heated the atmosphere evenly, it might not trigger violent weather events. But the presence of heat-trapping gases raises the thermal differential between equator and poles, speeding the rush of air from the tropics to higher latitudes.
Toronto science writer Dotto ( The Ozone War , Asleep in the Fast Lane ) is careful to address the "question of proof." The pace of human-induced climate change can only be slowed by cutting our production of heat-trapping gases. This, in turn, requires major changes in technology, investment patterns and lifestyle. She notes that major sectors of the business community demand "proof that global warming is happening, that human activities are causing it, and that it will have adverse effects on human society and the environment." These skeptics are well financed and well organized, and have bought time by clouding the debate. But their days may be numbered in terms of scientific proof.
The skeptics have relied heavily on satellite-derived data interpreted as showing the lower atmosphere to be cooling. In fact, allowing for orbital decay of the relevant satellites, these data actually show a warming trend of about 0.07 C a decade, a figure "more consistent with [other] climate models." Commenting on the skeptics' reversal of fortunes, New Scientist magazine notes that "one of [their] last props is crumbling." Evidence of a significant human fingerprint on climate change is mounting fast.
Dotto writes that 1995 "was a year for wild weather all over the world. It was the hottest year in more than a century since record-keeping began." But 1995 was beaten by 1997, and then 1998 broke high-temperature records for every single month, according to U.S. Vice-President Al Gore.
The insurance industry -- which pays for violent weather through damage claims -- has been sounding the alarm for years. The Reinsurance Association of America is particularly active. European insurers regularly speak at conferences discussing heat-trapping gases. Paul Kovacs, point man for the Insurance Bureau of Canada, says insurance payments for natural catastrophes used to be small. He told me a year ago: "1987 was the first year something happened anywhere for which the insurance industry had to pay $1-billion. The industry has been hit 18 times in the past 11 years with multi-billion-dollar events." Floods, droughts, hurricanes, hail, the apocalyptic ice storm of '98: Dotto cites them all.
Canada is one of the best places on earth to research climate change. Canadian scientists have led the world in seeking to understand how the atmosphere works since the pioneering days of Kenneth Hare. The Canadian Climate Centre General Climatic Model is used around the globe. Beyond outlining the science, Dotto provides a valuable service in tracking the political debate. Scientists can only create models that tell us how much heat, how soon. It is in the political arena that this problem must be solved.
Storm Warning is not an easy read, and Dotto could have sacrificed some statistics in favour of style. But her book gives an impressive overview of a crucial subject and serves as a valuable reference resource.
The Industrial Age that began two centuries ago gradually taught us to divorce ourselves from nature -- which is how recent generations came to distort the tale of Canute and the tide. In the 11th century, King Canute ordered his advisers to sit on a beach while he commanded the tide to retreat. They nearly drowned. Until the start of the Industrial Revolution, the lesson Canute was trying to teach was understood perfectly. In a dramatic way, he succeeded in demonstrating to arrogant courtiers the limits of human power. Storm Warning provides valuable ammunition on global warming, which must drive home a similar lesson before it's too late.

Abstract: The signs of warming-driven changes to our climate have become impossible to ignore. Despite congressional opposition, the United States will ultimately have to join the rest of the world in tackling the potentially catastrophic problem of global warming by cutting emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from coal and oil burning. But the Clinton administration's mechanism-of-choice for those reductions centers around a dubious system of international "emissions trading" designed to find the least costly ways for wealthy nations to reduce emissions. To truly address the climate crisis we need to embark now on large-scale energy efficiency and conservation programs. Ultimately we need a global project to replace coal-burning power plants, oil- burning furnaces and gas-burning cars with low-carbon and renewable energy. That kind of frontal approach, moreover, could substantially expand the real wealth and the stability of the global economy far more than a system of illusory trading credits.

Full text:   Ross Gelbspan is the author of "The Heat Is On" (Perseus Books).
Announcements of the "hottest year in recorded history" are becoming annual events.
The escalating losses from severe storms, droughts, and floods is sending shock waves through the property insurance industry. Last year's 9,000 hurricane casualties in Central America and the $1 billion in damages earlier this month from 318-mile-an-hour tornadoes are two recent examples.
The signs of warming-driven changes to our climate have become impossible to ignore. Despite congressional opposition, the United States will ultimately have to join the rest of the world in tackling the potentially catastrophic problem of global warming by cutting emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from coal and oil burning.
But the Clinton administration's mechanism-of-choice for those reductions centers around a dubious system of international "emissions trading" designed to find the least costly ways for wealthy nations to reduce emissions.
Unfortunately, by embracing unrestricted trading, the administration is pandering to the fossil fuel lobby, alienating allies in Europe and the developing world, and ignoring what nature requires to keep this planet hospitable to civilization.
Scientific research states unambiguously that to stabilize the climate requires cuts of 60 to 70 percent in emissions. Against that background, a loophole-riddled paper system of international carbon trading is no more than an expression of institutional denial.
To truly address the climate crisis we need to embark now on large-scale energy efficiency and conservation programs. Ultimately we need a global project to replace coal-burning power plants, oil- burning furnaces and gas-burning cars with low-carbon and renewable energy. That kind of frontal approach, moreover, could substantially expand the real wealth and the stability of the global economy far more than a system of illusory trading credits.
Two years ago, 160 nations met in Japan to forge the Kyoto Protocol, which calls on wealthy nations to cut emissions by the year 2012. The US obligation amounts to 7 percent below 1990 levels. Developing nations will cut emissions under the next phase of the treaty.
Since the Kyoto agreement, the concept of permit trading has gathered momentum. Companies are researching schemes to pay others to preserve or increase their own emissions. The World Bank is attempting to price emissions to jump-start a trading market. Even the Environmental Defense Fund plans to make money by brokering carbon trades.
Trading between industrial countries allows a nation (or company) that reduces emissions by more than its quota to sell off leftover rights. Under a North-South variation, a company in the North can get credit for "emissions avoided" by paying for low-cost reductions in a developing country -- planting trees in Costa Rica, upgrading old Chinese generating plants or financing coal cleaning equipment in India. But the "emissions avoided" will exist as accounting artifacts with little impact on our overheated atmosphere.
Most European and developing countries are angered by the Clinton administration's insistence on achieving virtually all cuts through trading -- with no meaningful reductions at home.
The recognition is growing, moreover, that trading is simply inadequate to the climate crisis. "International carbon trading is a scam that is going to give emissions trading a bad name," said John Henry, a Washington-based entrepreneur who made sizable profits brokering trades for the domestic US sulfur dioxide trading program.
Henry explained the domestic sulfur dioxide trading program worked because virtually all those emissions came from 2,000 smokestacks -- a manageable number to monitor. Moreover, the program operated under an enforceable national regulatory system. By contrast, carbon is emitted from millions of sources all over the world -- far too many to monitor. And there is no international regulatory system to enforce emission limits.
The reliance on permit trading, moreover, is inflaming North-South relations. In assigning quotas, the wealthy nations adopted a 1990 baseline to ensure continuity of their economies. But developing countries want allocations based on a more democratic per capita formula. Since an average American uses 20 times the carbon fuel of his Indian counterpart, a per capita system would scuttle the US economy.
A leading Indian environmentalist points out that the Kyoto Protocol allows wealthy countries to buy limitless amounts of cheap reductions in poor countries. That means that when developing nations must cut their own emissions under the next phase of the Protocol, they will be left with only the most expensive options, said Anil Agarwal, of the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi.
Trading appeals to the prevailing antiregulatory, free-market mentality. But that mentality ignores the physical realities of the planet. The laws of supply and demand do not supercede the laws of nature. We can't buy off the climate with derivatives.
The climate crisis requires binding international regulation. One possible approach involves changing subsidy policies, removing barriers to energy competition, adopting progressively higher efficiency rates, and paying for the transfer of clean energy to developing nations.
The United States spends $20 billion a year subsidizing fossil fuels; globally the figure is about $300 billion. If those subsidies were diverted to renewable energy (with a portion set aside to retrain coal miners), it would create a big incentive for oil companies to develop solar, wind and hydrogen technologies.
A meaningful regulatory response would remove barriers to free energy competition, especially protections for dirty, utility coal- burning plants. It would also establish a progressively more stringent fossil fuel efficiency standard.
In the United States, that would increase the efficiency of electrical generation from its current 35 percent efficiency rate to the 70-to-90 percent available with cogeneration technology. It would increase the dismally low gasoline mileage of cars by phasing in more efficient and alternative-fuel vehicles. And it would create the mass market renewable energy needs to become economically competitive with fossil fuels. Internationally, if each country began at its current baseline to increase its efficiency by specified amounts at designated intervals, it would eliminate the North-South impasse over the inequities of carbon trading.
Finally, since emissions from countries like India, China, Mexico, and Brazil will soon exceed our own, a fund is needed to transfer climate-friendly energy to poor nations. A tax on international currency transactions seems the most equitable, broad- based, and invisible mechanism.
With $1.5 trillion a day in currency transactions, a tiny tax of a quarter of a penny on a dollar would generate $200 billion to $300 billion a year for wind farms in India, cogeneration plants in South Africa, and solar assemblies in El Salvador. The tax, conceived by James Tobin, the Nobel laureate in economics, would help stabilize the destructive volatility of capital flows at the same time.
This kind of plan would do more than help return the global climate to the relative stability it has enjoyed since the end of the last Ice Age. It would create millions of jobs all over the world and allow poor nations to raise living standards without compromising economic achievements in the North.
Schemes like "emissions trading" look neat on paper. Unfortunately, they will not slow the melting of the earth's glaciers, the breakup of Antarctic ice shelves, rising sea levels, warming-driven migrations of disease, the intensification of El Ninos, and the relentless increase in floods, droughts, and severe storms.
To do that we must restore the 10,000-year-old balance of our atmosphere that we are destroying with the 6 billion tons of carbon we emit every year.

Abstract: Far be it from us to argue bankruptcy and insolvency legalities with an expert, but it does seem passing strange that the region wouldn't have the right to terminate its contract with PUMC even though the original agreement offers escape clauses in the event that PUMC or its parent company file for creditor protection, become insolvent, or transfer control to another company. In any case, legal threats notwithstanding, the region should have adhered to the higher principle of ensuring the best possible deal for taxpayers. It should have moved to cancel its agreement with PUMC, citing Philip's looming insolvency as sufficient reason. Then it should have opened the process to competition, getting an objective assessment of PUMC's assets and inviting prospective operators, including Azurix, to tender bids. In short, it should have learned from the mistakes that were made with Philip. In hindsight, it appears that all of us were wrong. Too many benefits promised by PUMC didn't materialize, while public progress reports and performance appraisals were short-lived. Recriminations are pointless now, except to the extent that they help us learn from past mistakes and make better choices in the future. If we learned nothing else from the PUMC experiment, it should be obvious that a public competition remains the best way to decide which private sector partners are best qualified and suited to operate public services.

Full text: Hamilton-Wentworth taxpayers should be furious today. Regional council has agreed to the sale of Philip Utilities Management Corp. - - the company that holds the region's sewage and water treatment contract -- without first knowing that the deal in question is the best one for taxpayers.
In its haste to strike a deal before PUMC's parent company, Philip Services Corp., applies for protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, council has committed taxpayers to a contract with Azurix Corp., a subsidiary of Texas-based Enron Corp. Is it a good deal? We're left to take the word of regional council and staff, who assure us it is. Is it the best deal available? Who knows? There was no tendering, no competition for the lucrative contract. It was largely a closed process that discouraged public scrutiny and opposition.
Regional council's defence of this decision goes something like this. An expert legal opinion strongly urged councillors to consent. What are the specifics? We can't tell you, because the legal advice was rendered to council in a closed-door session. In general terms, the lawyer questioned the region's right to break the contract prior to the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act action beginning. And the lawyer warned that once the CCAA proceedings get under way, the region would risk losing benefits now being offered by Azurix and would surrender any decisions on the present contract to the judge in charge.
Far be it from us to argue bankruptcy and insolvency legalities with an expert, but it does seem passing strange that the region wouldn't have the right to terminate its contract with PUMC even though the original agreement offers escape clauses in the event that PUMC or its parent company file for creditor protection, become insolvent, or transfer control to another company.
In any case, legal threats notwithstanding, the region should have adhered to the higher principle of ensuring the best possible deal for taxpayers. It should have moved to cancel its agreement with PUMC, citing Philip's looming insolvency as sufficient reason. Then it should have opened the process to competition, getting an objective assessment of PUMC's assets and inviting prospective operators, including Azurix, to tender bids. In short, it should have learned from the mistakes that were made with Philip.
In 1994, PUMC/Philip was awarded the sewage and water treatment contract as part of a drive to privatize some services. The fact that there was no tendering process at the time was criticized by a few people, but had broad support including the unanimous agreement of regional council as well backing from the unions involved and The Spectator's editorial board.
In hindsight, it appears that all of us were wrong. Too many benefits promised by PUMC didn't materialize, while public progress reports and performance appraisals were short-lived. Recriminations are pointless now, except to the extent that they help us learn from past mistakes and make better choices in the future. If we learned nothing else from the PUMC experiment, it should be obvious that a public competition remains the best way to decide which private sector partners are best qualified and suited to operate public services.
Armed with that knowledge, regional council had an opportunity in this case to make a better choice, using a tried and true process that by its very nature promotes competition and accountability.
None of this is to suggest that Azurix isn't an attractive suitor. The company is offering a compelling package: A $7.7- million investment in much-needed construction of a pre-treatment plant, 50 to 60 jobs in downtown Hamilton and more than $600,000 to pay outstanding insurance claims.
Azurix may well have been the successful bidder had the contract been open to competition, but we'll never know that now. Thanks to regional council, we'll never know whether taxpayers got the best deal possible or not.
RE: 'Experts agree -- our climate is changing' (May 3).
I wish to comment on David Suzuki's response to The Spectator feature: 'Why Suzuki struck out' and to offer a different point of view on Canada's position in the so-called global warming controversy.
The cornerstone of Suzuki's argument is the United Nations- sponsored, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) "dire consequences" report on global warming -- supposedly peer reviewed and endorsed by 2,500 experts.
What Suzuki omits is that by 1997 more than two thirds of the original signatories to the IPCC report had withdrawn their support because the report's conclusions were modified without peer review, to exclude dissenting views and to present a more politically expedient message. In other words, the results were "fixed."
Suzuki omits that in 1997, a petition was signed by 17,000 climatologists, physicists, environmental engineers, disclaiming the findings of the IPCC report and providing convincing evidence that human fossil fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), chiefly carbon dioxide, have not contributed demonstrably to an increase in global temperatures.
There is much physical evidence to discount Suzuki's assessment that global temperatures are presently higher than hithertofore. This also is not addressed in his response. For example, one thousand years earlier, Viking explorers established arable farming communities on the West coast of Greenland. Today, the remains of those communities are covered by several metres of ice. No global warming here.
Recently, just 1,000 kilometres from the North Pole, the fossilized remains of a cold-blooded creature resembling a crocodile, were discovered. By examining and dating the creature's surroundings, it was concluded the climate in the Canadian Arctic, several million years earlier, was similar to what is experienced in Florida, today. No global warming here either.
These two examples of many, contradict the findings of the IPCC Report, which was the result of computer models attempting to predict climate change during coming decades. Those same models are incapable of accurately predicting tomorrow's weather.
We should be concerned that Canada has not rejected the United Nations IPCC report. Environment Canada currently employs thousands of scientists, researchers, ministerial functionaries and hangers- on, supposedly studying climate change. More are being hired. Why would Canada make such a huge commitment based on a flawed report from the IPCC?
In 1995, Canada lobbied to obtain a seat in the prestigious United Nations Security Council. Canada gave unconditional support to the United Nations IPCC Report and in Kyoto in 1997, committed all Canadians to reduce fossil fuel consumption by 25 per cent over the next 10 years or so.
We set an example for the rest of the world. However such reductions would have a seriously debilitating effect on our present standard of living, were they achievable.
While Canada was endorsing this ill-conceived plan, it agreed to specifically exclude the so-called "non-tier 1" countries, China, Brazil, India, CSSR and others, who are significant GHG producers. They are excluded from the Kyoto protocol on the grounds that to include them would "irretrievably damage their economies."
So in these countries it will be "business as usual." Unlike Canada, their industries will not have to buy expensive, alternative energy technology. Canada's global competitiveness will be damaged further. This is not sound policy. It is duplicitous and it just does not make sense, so why are we doing it?
Through the haze of climate change controversy, one thing is crystal clear. A new, multi-billion dollar industry of lobbyists, government agencies, environmental consultants and self-professed salvationists, has been created. It is in their interest to keep us confused and feeling guilty, so we will continue to support their jobs and pay their salaries.
I fear Mr. Suzuki is no different in this regard. By serious omissions in his recent response, Suzuki has, unwittingly or otherwise, subscribed to the notion which he finds most abhorrent; that of scientists acting as lawyers for political and financial gain.
And by the way, Canada was awarded a UN Security Council seat in December, 1998. It is now front and centre in the Kosovo conflict.

Full text: B.C.'s Wild Weather
Roger Pannett is a self-confessed weather addict.
Watching the sky, checking temperatures and measuring rainfall have always been part of his life, and for the last 11 years they've been a daily ritual.
And while his practised eye lets him take a good stab at a weather forecast, Pannett is more in the business of recording what is past than what is coming.
He is the Chilliwack connection in the Volunteer Climate Observers Program, a 350-strong network of people who take weather readings twice daily from home-based stations throughout the province.
The readings are sent in regularly to Environment Canada, providing a solid record of B.C.'s climate.
Peter Greenwood, of Environment Canada's climate services, says the unpaid volunteers come in all shapes and sizes.
"The people come from just about every walk of life. We've had them in a prison. We still have them in the seminary in Mission. We've had everyone from priests to farmers to convicts."
Pannett, a provincial milk quality inspector, says recording the weather has been a hobby for years.
"I regard it as my contribution towards society. I'm just trying to help out."
Twice a day, week in, week out, Pannett opens up the Stevenson screen that shelters his instruments from direct sun and wind to check for high and low temperatures.
He records the humidity and when it rains or snows, he measures that, too.
"There's a practical connection because I have a good working relationship with farmers, and a lot of them depend on weather information for their livelihood."
Pannett began supplying temperatures from his Chilliwack backyard in 1988, after his predecessor died. Chilliwack has been producing records since 1878, and continuity is everything.
"I heard they were looking for a volunteer, so I applied. They came and checked my backyard to make sure I had enough exposure and said O.K.
"I take readings at 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. I'm starting to work my son Thomas in right now, because he can do it while I'm away with work."
Greenwood says the volunteers' work is indispensible.
"Because it's not a sexy, contemporary style program, it sometimes gets overlooked. But it's something we in this country should be extremely proud of.
"In some cases the station has been in the family and been passed on for 60 or 70 years."
The recordings are sent in monthly to Gary Myers, who is in charge of climate data at the weather office in Vancouver.
The information is used, not only by climatologists, but by insurance companies for claims, lawyers pursuing lawsuits and for engineers in designing buildings and structures.
Weather information is even used by forensic pathologists who combine it with insect activity on a body to find out the time of death.
"It's used a lot for monitoring trends," said Myers. "Climate change is one of the biggies with Environment Canada and if you don't have a long period of records from a number of stations, then you can't tell if the climate is changing."
Myers says twice-daily rain observations are especially important during the flood season.
After a 60-year absence, a weather observer was re-established in 1996 for Henderson Lake in Vancouver Island's rainforest.
In 1997, that site recorded 8,997.1 millimetres of rain -- the most anywhere in North America.
"We enjoy that," said Myers, "even if it means you're the wettest place in North America."
Budget tightening has reduced the number of climate stations, which cost up to $1,800 each for set-up and training.
Some climate observers serve double duty as Severe Weather Watchers, who call in emergencies to meteorologists in Vancouver.
"Sometimes they don't believe what I'm telling them because they're sitting in the main computer centre with the satellites," said Pannett. "But they appreciate the ground observations.
"One time we had a hailstorm through here with hailstones about an inch in diameter. It was really unusual for the Fraser Valley but it was a localized event that could have had an impact on aircraft."

Abstract: The first meeting of states party to the Ottawa convention banning anti-personnel landmines begins in Maputo, Mozambique, one of the countries most affected by the landmine scourge. The Ottawa convention, which came into force on March 1, has been ratified by 68 countries and signed by 133, though these do not include leading landmine users such as the US, Russia, India, Pakistan and China. The week-long meeting will consider plans for implementing the treaty, which requires the destruction of stockpiles within four years and the elimination of laid mines within 10 years. Yassir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, is due to decide whether or not to declare an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza when a five-year interim peace deal with Israel expires today. A declaration of statehood could wreck the peace process, playing into the hands of the Israeli right and alienating Arafat's support in Europe and the US. Delaying the declaration would add to the growing impatience among Palestinians for an end to Israeli settlement in the West Bank and undermine Arafat's support. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe begins its annual meeting in Geneva. The three-day session will focus on eastern Europe in the light of the Russian crisis and the war in Kosovo. According to the ECE's economic survey published today, much of eastern Europe was already heading for a slowdown but the Kosovo conflict could tip many countries into recession. The ECE is urging a "Marshall plan" solution to post-war reconstruction in south-east Europe.

Full text: IN 1989 environmentalist Bill McKibben published a book called The End of Nature. In it he argued that humans had so drastically reshaped the Earth that it was no longer possible to speak of a natural world separate from their control. Even on top of the most remote mountain, the air, and its temperature, will show signs of human influence. For McKibben the proclamation in Genesis giving Man dominion over every living thing had come fully and alarmingly to pass.
McKibben was describing a fundamental philosophical shift in our conception of the planet. One person strongly influenced by it was Phillip Toyne. "When anti-flammable compounds are turning up in polar bears' milk in the Arctic, you realise there's nowhere free of human hands."
As director of the Australian Conservation Foundation between 1986 and 1992, Toyne was at the heart of the environment movement when it was at the heart of Australian politics. He helped to lead campaigns against mining at Coronation Hill, Wesley Vale pulp mill and development in the Daintree. He was central to the Labor Government's 1990 re-election strategy based on the green vote.
Despite these successes, Toyne had a growing sense of frustration. "I always felt that the environment movement was seen as being against everything. What I always sought were things you could be for." What's more, the movement's focus on protecting endangered wild places created its own problems: you didn't just save a place once, you had to save it again and again (Toyne cites the Barrier Reef, declared a marine park in the 1970s but now threatened by tourism and mining). And big public victories over development came at a huge cost - the perception in industry and government that, as Toyne puts it, "the greens were getting too much".
McKibben's book showed Toyne that environmentalists had to do more than just fight to protect pristine wilderness. In 1997 he and his wife, Molly Harriss Olson - an American who had headed Bill Clinton's Council for Sustainable Development - created a company, Eco Futures. In the early '90s Toyne had worked with the National Farmers Federation to create Landcare; now he wanted to work with businesses that wanted to improve their environmental record. He calls it "going upstream to try and address the problem at its source. How do you identify those who are going to be a threat to the environment, and how do you change their behavior and mindset?"
As Toyne moved upstream, he met Doug Dean coming the other way. As managing director of Collex Waste Management, Dean says he wanted to "show the public that we are not just another garbage contractor" clogging up the country with waste. He saw that in the long-term popular concern over the environment would continue to grow. "Unless we embrace sustainable development we are going to get run over with it anyway, by regulation or by public perception. And I would rather lead it than get belted into it."
Today Dean is working with Toyne and Olson to create an unusual waste dump at Woodlawn, 30kilometres from Goulburn, New South Wales. Waste from northern Sydney will be transported by rail instead of truck, significantly reducing greenhouse emissions. It's a more costly method of transport, but an impost of $20 a year on each north Sydney resident is a price local councils are prepared to pay. At Woodlawn the methane that landfills produce will not go straight into the sky, as it does at many conventional dumps, but will be captured and used to generate electricity that will be either sold on to the national grid or used to power new industries on site. Carbon dioxide and heat will also be trapped and used to warm hot houses on site that will grow flowers for commercial sale. All this not only comes at no extra cost to the company but creates efficiencies that bring a financial benefit, says Dean. "Quite honestly, the reason we have embraced environmental concerns is because there is an economic as well as a social result."
Are such green-business partnerships the future of environmental politics? Toyne says he quit as deputy secretary of the Federal Environment Department in 1997 in part because he realised that business, rather than government, "was going to lead the changes. The commercial imperatives - not to lose money, and even to make money - will drive it".
In 1996 the Club of Rome, which raised the alarm about unrestrained use of natural resources in its 1972 report, Limits to Growth, published a book called Factor Four. It argued that better technology and dramatically more efficient use of resources and energy - spurred by new eco-taxes - could enable economic growth to continue, without hurting the environment. It proposed a way out of the old economy-ecology impasse; we could be rich and green.
Unsurprisingly, the report has many admirers. Environmentalist David Suzuki calls it priceless; Greg Bourne, regional director of BP Amoco Australia-New Zealand, says it is a "tremendous work". Just as unsurprisingly, the idea that growth need not be challenged has sceptics. Without strong government to rein it in, "the private sector will never deliver a livable environment," says environmentalist Peter Hay of Tasmania University. "It runs against all the short-term imperatives of capitalism."
Other environmentalists warn against "greenwash" - company policies that go no further than placing dolphins on the side of packets, for example. Yet overseas there have been some road-to-Damascus conversions. Ford Motor Company chairman Bill Ford has predicted that environmental concern will see the demise of the internal combustion engine that was mass-produced by his great-grandfather Henry. Insurance companies such as the giant German re-insurer Munich Re, alarmed by the effect on their bottom line of a sharp rise in natural disasters over the past decade, now openly acknowledge the threat of global warming.
Perhaps most remarkably, in the past two years BP Amoco and Shell have left the Global Climate Coalition, a body set up by the oil companies to lobby against action on greenhouse emissions, and declared that evidence of global warming is strong enough to warrant big changes in their business. BP Amoco promises that by 2010 it will have reduced greenhouse emissions at its operations to 20per cent below 1990 levels. It has also pledged to increase turnover from its solar power businesses to $US1billion in two years. BP Amoco group chief executive, Sir John Browne calls the science of solar power immature but promising. Clive Hamilton of the Australia Institute says that "solar power is no longer hippy country. It's serious big business".
THE car bumper sticker reads No environment, no economy. But, with some striking exceptions, Australian business has been slow to read that message. Greg Bourne of BP-Amoco worries that mounting pressure for environmental change overseas has not registered here. Bourne thinks the agreement that Australia won at the Kyoto summit on climate change "was read by much of Australian industry and press that we got away scot free" and "we're allowed to be dirty". However, "a huge reduction has to happen and it's still not clear how it's going to be made".
Australia lags in other areas, too. European Automobile Manufacturers have committed themselves to reducing CO2 emissions from new passenger cars by 25per cent in the next 10 years. Executive director of the Australian Automobile Association, Lauchlan McIntosh, concedes the Australian car industry is behind the Europeans, but says that given the industry's low profit margins it needs "leadership" from the Federal Government - including tax breaks - to help it change.
A Cabinet note leaked last year revealed that the Government had resolved not to ratify the Kyoto agreement until the agreement's (unlikely) ratification in the United States Senate. Last month Greenpeace and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics clashed over Australia's likely increase in greenhouse emissions by the year 2010. Greenpeace said the figure would be 70per cent over 1990 levels; the bureau says 35 per cent. At the Kyoto conference Australia promised to increase by no more than 8per cent. Greenpeace researcher Shane Rattenbury thinks Australia has reached its Kyoto target already.
ACF president Peter Garrett says that while eight European countries have introduced carbon taxes, the Government has not even considered adopting "polluter pays" principles in the current GST debate. (An interview with Environment Minister Senator Robert Hill was sought for this article but he was unavailable.)
Garrett predicts that environmental sustainability will be the great issue of the 21st century. Yet his optimism runs counter to the near absence of the environment movement from national debate.
Kyoto, Hinchenbrook, uranium, logging, the transfer of environmental responsibility back to the states... the election of a Liberal Government in 1996 has seen one defeat after another for environmentalists. But their exclusion from the main corridors in Canberra began under Paul Keating. Both Labor and Liberal have taken to heart Bill Clinton's 1992 injunction, "It's the economy, stupid." How can the greens reinvent themselves?
Both the ACF and Greenpeace say membership numbers are again on the rise. Garrett says that "every city, every town has some group. Landcare, neighborhood groups, youth activists, people trying to bring a river back to life, or stop a development, being part of Clean Up Australia Day. There's a tremendous amount of activity, but people are desperate for firm leadership."
Garrett says the movement must seek "to embed the principles of sustainability into all our institutions, governments and corporations". That means people doing nothing at work, play or home that leaves the Earth worse off - and even leaves it better. It's a grand vision, but sustainability is a dry concept. Can it inspire activism? Garrett acknowledges green groups have to make this issue "as recognisable to the community as the consequences of damming a river or polluting a wetland. This is no easy task".
While the world haggles over small greenhouse gas reductions, the UN climate change panel of 2500 scientists says that to stabilise world climate, emissions must fall by 60per cent. Bill McKibben has written that if that happened, and if all remaining fossil fuel were shared equally among all human beings, population increase would mean that in the year 2025 each of us would be allowed enough CO2 to drive our car 10kilometres a day, with enough left over to run a highly efficient fridge. "Forget your computer, your TV, your stereo, your stove, your dishwasher, your microwave, your light bulbs, your clock ...Conservation, efficiency and new technology will help ... but the tremendous momentum of growth will work against them."
And that doesn't even consider the plight of poorer countries. In a 1994 Atlantic Monthly article, American journalist Robert Kaplan predicted wars over the impact of rising populations, deforestation, water depletion, air pollution and, possibly, rising sea levels. It is time, he wrote, "to understand The Environment for what it is: the national-security issue of the early 21st century".
Such predictions may in part explain why the environment has receded as a political issue. Some things seem just too hard to think about. Yet the paradox is that people think about it all the time: as they visit zoos, or wash dishes in detergent; waiting while paper churns out of the office printer, as their cars idle in traffic. They think about it in the bush, and other places they love.
It's hard to believe the environment won't return to the centre of public life. Environmentalists, says Australian writer Richard Flanagan, "have asked the great question that continues to haunt the industrial age, and that will shape the next century. How do we create a livable world?"
Peter Garrett, Robert Hill and Greg Bourne, along with Wendy Craik of the National Farmers Federation, will be speakers at The Age's next Vision 21 millennium series event, "Building a sustainable environment". It will be held at Melbourne's Exhibition Centre on Thursday 6 May. For more information, call 03 96506932. Advertisement, page 26.

Full text: Disaters such as the Sydney hailstorm are costing the world insurance industry more and more. Is this natural, or an early warning of human-induced climate change? Murray Hogarth reports.
STARTLING figures emerged late last year when Munich Re, the world's biggest reinsurer, compared the frequency and impact of the great natural catastrophes of the past decade with those of the 1960s. The number was up threefold, the overall economic losses had risen ninefold, and the payouts for the insurance industry had climbed 15-fold after allowing for inflation.
For those in the multi-billion-dollar global reinsurance industry, which allows insurance companies around the world to spread the risk of paying out on local disasters ranging from storms to earthquakes, such analysis is incredibly important. And Munich Re is widely acknowledged as having the best long-term data anywhere.
Based on past years, there is little doubt that when the insurance industry counts the financial cost of 1999, Sydney's $1 billion-plus autumn hailstorm will be in the global top 40. Locally, insurance premiums are almost certain to rise as a consequence. But even disasters far from Australia can have major implications for our economy.
Last week, as Sydney was struggling to deal with up to 20,000 hail-devastated houses, not to mention the damage to many thousands of vehicles, the financial media was reporting the business woes of locally based New Cap Reinsurance Corporation, which
is facing losses of nearly $US140 million ($215 million).
A major reason quoted for New Cap volunteering to bring in outside administrators, one step short of going into liquidation, was its share of insurance losses from 1998. This was a particularly bad year for catastrophes of all kinds, including hurricanes Georges and Mitch, the North American icestorms, and several satellite launch failures.
As The Australian Financial Review reported, two other Australian-based reinsurers, GIO Reinsurance and Reinsurance Australia Corporation, have also announced heavy losses from the 1998 disasters. And according to international predictions, 1999 is set to be another big year for at least one of the key destroyers, hurricanes off the East Coast of the United States.
So is this just the outcome of natural causes, combined with ever-growing numbers of people and amounts of property in the firing line? Or is the surge in losses from natural disasters early proof of something else: the dire scientific projections for planet-wide climate change, resulting from global warming, caused in turn by greenhouse gas pollution from human activities?
Certainly a key projection from climate change modellers is for there to be more frequent, and more ferocious extreme weather events. Also, anecdotally, many people believe they have seen the climate change for the worse in their lifetime.
In January, a report produced for the British insurance firms by the Benfield-Greig Hazard Research Centre suggested that global warming is causing a greater frequency and severity of weather- related natural disasters. Benfield-Greig found "a perceptible change which goes beyond natural cycles".
Greenpeace, which has focused heavily on the insurance industry in its international climate-change campaign, is adamant that proof is mounting. "Recent increases in Australia's climate extremes are disturbingly similar to those scientists expect from climate change," says Sydney-based campaigner Erwin Jackson. "It is about time Australian finance and insurance companies woke up and realised the threat posed to their industry by climate change."
Jackson cites research by the CSIRO, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other sources suggesting that the intensity of heavy rainfall events has increased over the past 80 years, that Australian cyclones, while decreasing in numbers, are becoming stronger, and that flood events can be expected to become much more frequent.
Three years ago the IPCC, in a report focused on Australasian vulnerability to climate change, noted that the cost of insured catastrophes in Australia (as a percentage of non-life insurance premiums) was nearly five times the global average. It also found that "the cost of insurance in the region has risen already because of increasingly large losses in the international reinsurance market from recent, mainly weather-related disasters".
But the expert jury is still undecided on whether or not the weather really has become more destructive already because of greenhouse pollution.
"I have a fairly open mind on the whole business," says Professor Russell Blong, director of the Natural Hazards Research Centre at Macquarie University. His centre, which is funded mainly by the insurance industry, is collecting details of all natural disasters in Australia over the past 100 years, and is matching them to postcode numbers.
Blong, despite having co-authored a book on the greenhouse issue a decade ago, says that his centre has not given its insurance industry backers "any advice at all" on the implications of global warming.
He believes, however, that the most important issue for Australia will be whether or not the El Nio/La Nia cycle, which is crucial to local weather patterns, is affected by greenhouse-driven changes. "I do not believe we can say that at the moment," says Blong. He also argues that it would be a mistake to confuse Sydney's latest hailstorm with "any aspect" of climate change. "There is absolutely no evidence," he says, quoting historical records of similar storms hitting Sydney on average once every 20 to 25 years.
And, says Blong, when Greenpeace retained him to study Pacific Ocean cyclones, he failed to find any trend from 70 years of records.
But Munich Re's figures show that, with the exception of a relatively disaster-free 1997, the economic toll of natural catastrophes has been running at near record levels right through the decade from 1989. And most of the huge loss of life, property and insurance dollars is being caused by weather- related events.
Last year, for example, Munich Re recorded 700 "large loss events", compared with the average for recent years of between 530 and 600 such events. The most frequent natural catastrophes were windstorms (240) and floods (170), which together accounted for 85 per cent of the economic losses, and no less than 90 per cent of the insured catastrophe losses.
The big three disasters of 1998 in terms of insured losses were Hurricane Georges at $US3.3 billion, a hailstorm that hit Minnesota and Iowa causing damage worth $US1.3 billion in insurance payouts, and $US1.1 billion for the icestorms that ravaged Canada and the northern US.
In disaster parlance, location and the term "insured losses" are crucial. Sydney's hailstorm, for example, is being described as the third-worst natural disaster in Australian history by the Insurance Council of Australia, topped only by Cyclone Tracy in Darwin in 1974 and the Newcastle earthquake of 1989.
But there was no loss of life in the hailstorm. If the same storm had hit cow paddocks, or a coastal national park - instead of some of the most expensive, aged and densely packed real estate in the country - the damage and the insurance losses were likely to have been negligible. The storm might have gone virtually unnoticed.
Likewise, if a hurricane hits the US coastline, a lot of people and property covered by insurance are likely to be affected. But in the developing world, there is little insurance cover, although loss of life and property may be huge. By far the biggest disaster last year in terms of economic loss, put at $US30 billion, was the floods in China. About 3,600 lives were lost, but insured losses amounted to only $US1 billion.
For Dr Gerhard Berz, the head of Munich Re's Geoscience Research Group, its figures suggest that greenhouse gas pollution is indeed causing global warming, leading to actual climate change.
"A further advance in man-made climate change will almost inevitably bring us increasingly extreme natural events and consequently increasingly large catastrophe losses," Berz has said. "Even radical environmental protection measures cannot prevent the occurrence of ever more and ever costlier natural catastrophes worldwide."
Munich Re's attention has been drawn to the fact that eight of the 10 hottest years recorded by humans have occurred in the past decade, including last year being the hottest since world-wide measurements were first taken 150 years ago.
"The unusually large number of tropical cyclones and other extreme weather conditions, such as the heat wave, forest fires, and storms in the United States and the icestorm in the south-east of Canada at the beginning of the year, may in part be explained by the natural climate fluctuations of El Nio and La Nia," says Munich Re's 1998 report.
It continues: "The noticeable accumulation of extreme atmos- pheric events may be taken as an indication that global warming is leading to an exacerbation of the natural catastrophe hazard in many regions of the world. As recent years in Europe have shown, the warmer the winters, the more frequent and more severe the storms."
Russell Blong, however, expresses reservations about Munich Re's data, and its conclusions regarding climate change, which he says are largely driven by Berz himself (who, coincidentally, did his PhD on hail). Blong points to work by another global reinsurance giant, Swiss Re, which publishes its annual sigma report based on records back to 1970.
This report also concludes that the number and extent of both natural and human-made catastrophes increased between 1970 and 1998. Of 35 $US1 billion-plus disasters recognised by Swiss Re over this period, only 11 occurred between 1970 and 1988, while 24 have come since 1989. Similarly to Munich Re, it attributes this to higher population densities, more insured values in endangered areas, and a higher concentration of such values in industrialised nations.
But on climate change, Swiss Re is less bullish than Munich Re.
"Scientifically speaking there is as yet no indication of a significant long-term change in the frequency of events which can be ascribed to climate change," says sigma. "Science is concentrating increasingly on longer-range probability forecasts for natural events, with natural climatic variability being a central consideration."
On the hard scientific evidence, therefore, Sydney's latest hailstorm was by no means unique. It was not even especially rare, considering that the last big one was in 1990. As Blong argues, it cannot be cited as proof of climate change at work. But to the world's insurers, and their hundreds of millions of customers, the sheer impact of this and similar catastrophes may well be a taste of worse to come.
For consumers, even increased uncertainty about what the risks of disasters are will be enough to push their premiums higher.

Full text: Highly destructive hailstorms such as the $1 billion-plus catastrophe that hit Sydney 13 days ago can be expected four or five times a century, a natural disaster expert warns.
Professor Russell Blong, director of Macquarie University's Natural Hazards Research Centre, also said hailstorms had overtaken cyclones as our biggest cause of "insured losses".
He criticised claims that the hailstorm havoc still gripping the city was a rare, one-in-100-year event.
"It's a one-in-20 to 25-year event, in terms of the hail," Professor Blong said.
A major hailstorm in 1990 affected a larger area, a 1976 storm blanketed a huge area with smaller hail and Sydney had been hit by a very intense hailstorm on New Year's Day 1947.
Professor Blong said hailstorms were the number one natural disaster problem for the insurance industry, despite the higher profile of tropical cyclones.
"Hailstorms are much more important for insured losses than cyclones," said Professor Blong, whose research centre is heavily funded by the insurance industry.
The Insurance Council of Australia has ranked the Sydney hailstorm as its third most expensive natural disaster, behind Darwin's Cyclone Tracy in 1974 and the Newcastle earthquake in 1989.
A 1993 study of climate change and the insurance industry by a Greenpeace International scientific director, Dr Jeremy Leggett, ranked cyclones as the top destroyers of insured property, ahead of hailstorms and earthquakes.
Dr Leggett quoted Insurance Council records showing that 46 cyclones between 1967 and 1990 had average insured losses of $33.5 million, while 17 hailstorms over the same period had average losses of $62.9 million.
But Professor Blong is adamant hailstorms since 1990 have taken them to number one.
However, he also said the direct impacts of hailstorms, cyclones and earthquakes would all lag behind floods and droughts in terms of total economic losses for the country, as opposed to insured losses.
Most of the impacts of floods and droughts are not covered by insurance because it is either unavailable or prohibitively expensive in a land of drought and flooding rains.
On the basis of total economic value, Professor Blong said the east coast floods of 1974 and the 1982-83 drought could be the worst natural disasters ever recorded in Australia, with latter potentially costing $7 billion in 1985 dollars.
The hailstorm is also a big destroyer overseas.
One in the United States Midwest last May was the second biggest "insured loss" event of 1998, with payouts for damage in Minnesota and Iowa reaching $US1.3 billion. It took more than six months for the full extent of the bill to emerge.
Professor Blong said the three main factors influencing extreme disaster events were plate tectonics, related to earthquakes, the tropical cyclone belt, and aspects of the El Nio and La Nia cycle.
Australia was relatively stable in regard to earthquakes, and cyclones tended to be more severe in the Northern Hemisphere. However, Australia was the most-affected region in the world in regard to El Nio and La Nia.

Full text: You want to buy a new home. But after Sydney's rising insurance bill for a hailstorm 13 days ago, what is the risk of being hit by another natural disaster?
By the end of next year help may be at hand, thanks to new research, and a huge project to cross-reference 10,000 natural disaster events over the past century with 2,300 postcode districts.
When it is finished a hazard-by-hazard risk rating - covering hailstorms, cyclones, floods, bushfires, earthquakes, landslides and tornadoes - will be available on computer.
The project is being undertaken by Macquarie University's Natural Hazards Research Centre for the Insurance Council of Australia.
Meanwhile, the owners of hailstorm-damaged premises are being advised to repair homes and buildings in the most environmentally friendly ways by a NSW Government agency.
The Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA) is advertising in suburban newspapers to promote energy-efficient alternatives.
The suggestions include reflective glass or double glazing for windows, roof insulation to save on heating and cooling costs and lighting options.
SEDA also advises installation of skylights to let in "lots of lovely light". However, when the hailstorm hit, many skylights were smashed by hailstones up to nine centimetres in diameter.
So why rebuild to save energy, apart from cutting power bills?
SEDA explains that more than 90 per cent of electricity used in NSW comes from coal-fired power stations, which produce massive amounts of carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas causing global climate change.
Although left unsaid by SEDA, a key forecast by climate change scientists is for more and more extreme weather events.

Insurers' risk slight from global warming

Full text:   NEW YORK (Agencies via Xinhua) _ Global warming may melt the ice caps but it will not sink the US insurance industry.
Politicians and other activists have been trying to turn up the heat on insurers, warning that the industry faces devastating losses if it does not take more steps to reduce the global warming threat.
New York politicians in February held a hearing to discuss the threat to the insurance industry and to force it to play a greater role in efforts to tackle the problem.
A warmer global climate would melt the ice caps, raising sea levels, and would disturb weather patterns, causing droughts, severe storms, tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards.
US government scientists on Thursday said carbon dioxide emissions could heat up the Earth by an average of 3 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) over the next century.
Fears about the threat to the US insurance industry are overblown, according to David Unnewehr, senior research manager for the American Insurance Association, a trade group that represents more than 375 property-casualty insurers.
That is because only about 20 per cent of the industry's nearly US$300 billion in annual business is affected by weather, Unnewehr said in a report released last week.
"Climate change does not pose a severe threat to the US property- casualty insurance industry," Unnewehr said in a statement. "About one-fifth of the industry's business is affected by weather and the industry is diverse and resilient enough to cope with any change in loss experience," he said.
For insurers, the biggest weather threat comes from hurricanes, which have the potential to cause tens of billions of dollars in losses.
Unnewehr said scientific research showed little evidence that global warming would increase the frequency and severity of hurricanes.
"Much of the research seems to indicate that global warming would not increase the frequency of hurricanes and might even suppress hurricane development," he said in the report.
In addition, Colorado State Professor William Gray, a noted hurricane forecaster, believes there is little or no connection between global warming and hurricane development.
"The real problem is the tremendous growth in population, homes, commercial development in hurricane-prone regions of the United States, especially Florida and other states along the Southeast and Gulf coasts," he said.
Meanwhile, global warming could help to lessen the losses from winter storms and freezing, he said.
Over the past 10 to 15 years, property-casualty insurers have paid more than US$8 billion in winter storm and freeze losses, he said. Those losses include burst pipes, ice damming on roofs, collapsed roofs because of heavy snow and downed power lines.
If global warming did result in increased storm losses from tornadoes, hailstorms and other events, insurers would have the ability to adjust premiums, he said.
These adjustments do not always take place quickly or easily, he said. But the solvency of insurance companies is one of the responsibilities of state regulation.
Insurers also have some flexibility in deciding where they want to do business.
"The property-casualty insurance industry is very resilient and, where necessary, adapts to changing loss experience," he said. "Furthermore, the industry is a leader in advocating measures to minimize damage and injury that can be caused by weather-related events.

Full text: THE Government should scale down its proposed energy tax to help give the UK's hard-pressed industry a breathing space, CBI boss Adair Turner told Midlands business chiefs.
Mr Turner warned that the plan for a "climate change levy" could heap extra burdens on manufacturers at a time when they were least able to bear it.
And he picked out the idea of giving a 50 per cent rebate to high energy users for criticism, saying the amount was too small.
Speaking at the regional Confederation of British Industry dinner in Nottingham, he said: "While the whole economy has avoided recession, the manufacturing sector hasn't.
"Any levy will inevitably create winners and losers but our concern is that the majority of losers will be manufacturing companies since the rebate is going to be paid via national insurance contributions - not helpful for a cement plant that uses a lotof energy but doesn't have that many staff."

Full text:   Global warming may not carry such a stiff health warning for the U.S. property/casualty insurance industry as was once thought, according the American Insurance Association.
An analysis of that and other climate changes released April 19 by the AIA found that P/C insurance lines facing either moderate or significant exposure to weather-related losses represent less than 20 percent of the industry's premium base.
"Advocates of aggressive climate change action have overestimated the vulnerability of the U.S. P/C insurance industry to climate change," said David Unnewehr, AIA senior research manager."The property/casualty insurance industry is very resilient and, where necessary, adapts to changing loss experience. Furthermore, the industry is a leader in advocating measures to minimize damage and injury that can be caused by weather-related events."
LONG DEBATE
The insurance industry has long had an uncomfortable position in the debate over man's affect on weather patterns, which then go on to cause disasters.
The environmentalist community has long argued that continued reliance on fossil-fuel powered electricity production will lead to altered weather behavior, particularly fiercer storms.
It has, in the past, appealed directly to the insurance industry to encourage more environmentally friendly companies by channeling the huge amount of money it invests commercially in that direction.
The idea is that this would be a self-interested move on the part of insurers as fiercer storms mean heavier property insurance claims. However, climate changes, whether good or bad, take a long time to happen.
In its recent report AIA noted that little evidence exists in any case to show a correlation between climate change and hurricane development and intensity.
In the meantime, the insurance industry has taken a fairly soft approach in looking for ways of putting investors' money into funds that are both profitable and environmentally responsible.
Hurricanes are the most potent weather events, with the potential for tens of billions of dollars in losses.
"Regarding hurricane damage potential, climate change is not the most critical factor," Mr. Unnewehr said.
"The real problem is the tremendous growth in population, homes and commercial development in the most hurricane-prone regions of the United States, especially Florida and other states along the Southeast and Gulf coasts. The increasing amount of insured exposure in hurricane-prone areas is of substantial concern, whether or not climate change occurs."
Mr. Unnewehr noted that three metropolitan Miami Counties in South Florida -- Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach -- now have a greater combined population than did all of the nation's coastal counties from South Texas to Virginia during the 1930s.
DENSE COASTAL COUNTIESIncreased population density in the nation's most hurricane prone areas -- the coastal counties of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina -- is expected to outpace the national rate of increase in population density.
"Climate change or not, insurers, coastal communities and many other groups would like to have a greater understanding of hurricane development and intensification," Mr. Unnewehr said.
"No other weather event has the potential to deliver catastrophic losses that could endanger the solvency of a substantial number of insurers."
Perhaps the most important role insurers perform, the AIA said, was in the in advocating mitigation efforts to cut losses. Insurers have led efforts in urging loss prevention measures for their business and individual customers, through driver and auto safety, work-place safety, property loss mitigation and anti-fraud efforts.
Additionally, the industry is fully engaged in the process of catastrophe mitigation through efforts to improve and educate the public about building codes and their enforcement, building design, construction methodologies and materials, and land-use control measures designed to keep the public out of harm's way, the report said.
"This will have positive societal payoffs particularly in areas that are already at risk from weather-related natural disasters," Mr. Unnewehr argued.
"And insurers are cooperating in ways to identify numerous areas where energy efficiency and risk reduction, safety, and the insurance process achieve synergy. One example of an insurer-supported policy that not only saves lives and prevents injuries but also saves energy is lower speed limits," he added.
"Experience during the 1970s and 1980s with a lower national speed limit of 55 mph has conclusively shown that lower speeds not only save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also lower deaths and injuries on the highways," Mr. Unnewehr pointed out.

Full text: I'm walking south on Second Avenue. It's about noon. Ahead of me I see a little pool of water forming on the sidewalk, fed from a small stream flowing from a store's recessed entranceway. As I pass the doors, I notice a man urinating in a corner. He gives me a dirty look when I seem surprised.
Later, I notice that men have been urinating on walls elsewhere in the downtown core, where the streets seem to be strewn with much more litter than usual. In the bus mall, there is graffiti on the doors and windows of all the empty stores. One of the worst locations for litter is a hedge on the Fourth Avenue side of City Hall.
I know that early spring is the worst time of the year for litter and dog wastes. Still, it seems to me that our standards are slipping. Perhaps the fact that men are feeling free to urinate in public should tell us something of the deteriorating state of civic pride in Saskatoon.
In my travels to other countries, I have noticed that people in many places have no compunction about littering. I have always taken a certain pride in the fact that Canadians have a sense of civic pride, and generally keep their cities clean. Perhaps this situation is changing. Just the other day I heard a new immigrant from Eastern Europe comment on how dirty Saskatoon is.
What can we do about the mess? I have heard that some cities create opportunities for homeless people to make money by picking up pop bottles and cans. Perhaps we can take a cue from these programs, and offer our "problem panhandlers" a job cleaning up the city's litter. Say $5 for a bag of garbage? It might work. And perhaps it's time to bring back the kind of anti-litter campaigns I remember from my youth. One element might be an annual downtown clean-up day.
Expensive storms: the price of global warming?
Are we starting to pay the price of climate change?
The German reinsurance company Munich Re estimates that insurance companies have paid out US$91.8 billion in losses from weather- related natural disasters in the 1990s (with one more year to go). This amount is close to four times the weather-related claims handed out during in the 1980s.
According to Worldwatch, the rising insurance claims of the last decade have coincided with rises in global temperatures. The increasing toll of claims has already raised premiums and made it difficult to obtain insurance in disaster-prone areas. If the trend continues, insurance coverage could become unaffordable or even unavailable -- particularly in coastal regions and islands. Taxpayers may also have to foot the bill to help struggling insurance companies.
The largest insurance claims of 1998 were from Hurricane Georges, which cost insurers $3.3 billion; from the ice storm that swept across Canada and the U.S., costing $1.2 billion in insured damages; and from flooding in China, which cost the industry $1 billion.
The losses for the insurance industry would have been much higher had the largest events -- the Yangtze floods and Hurricane Mitch, which together cost $35 billion -- not occurred in poor regions with minimal insurance coverage. In China, the Yangtze floods displaced 223 million people!
Munich Re estimates the number of natural catastrophes has tripled since the 1960s, increasing the overall cost to the world's economies nine-fold, and the cost to the insurance industry 15- fold. The company attributes this large increase to the growing concentrations of people and property in coastal regions and other "high-risk zones," as well as to climate change. Scientists now believe that rising global temperatures may exacerbate extreme weather events, leading to increased damages in the decades ahead.
Recent studies have found that a single weather-related catastrophe could endanger the solvency of many insurance companies. The president of one reinsurance industry group believes that a $50 billion hurricane would exceed the financial capabilities of the insurance industry.

Abstract: The exploitation of wind as an energy source is growing rapidly, and with it Aerpac (UK), the Fife-based manufacturer of wind turbine blades. But although Scotland's climate is tailor-made for wind energy, 95% of the factory's production is exported to countries such as China, the United States, Russia and Canada. However, Colin Anderson, technical director of Aerpac, said the Scottish factory was opened in the hope of capturing a slice of what is a growing UK market.

Full text: The exploitation of wind as an energy source is growing rapidly, and with it Aerpac (UK), the Fife-based manufacturer of wind turbine blades.
Since the Glenrothes factory was established by its Dutch parent company in 1997, employment has grown from less than a dozen people to 70, and is expected to double in the next 12 months.
But although Scotland's climate is tailor-made for wind energy, 95% of the factory's production is exported to countries such as China, the United States, Russia and Canada.
However, Colin Anderson, technical director of Aerpac, said the Scottish factory was opened in the hope of capturing a slice of what is a growing UK market.
"There is a good infrastructure in Scotland and the skills are here which allow us to match the Dutch plant in quality and price.
"This allows us to produce orders for the world market, which is why the factory is expanding while we try to break into the UK," he said.
To compete for more Scottish-based business, Aerpac has developed a solution to the blade vibrations which are often caused in this country by high winds.
"This is important because the vibrations could lead to blades cracking, which means that the turbines have to be stopped for repairs, and this costs money."
Aerpac is also looking forward to an increased demand for wind power as a result of the Government's Climate Change Levy which was introduced in the last Budget, and comes into effect in 2001.
The impact of this is to increase the cost of industrial electricity which is not generated from renewable resources. The money raised from this levy will be redistributed by reducing the National Insurance contributions made by companies. Businesses which use "green energy" will benefit the most as they will not have to pay the levy in the first instance.

Full text:   INDUSTRY chiefs are warning the government that an energy tax unveiled in last month's Budget will hit exports and threaten jobs.
Trade bodies for high energy-use industries are preparing for a crucial meeting with the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions on Friday, when they will spell out their fears over the Climate Change Levy.
The meeting follows a summit on the issue with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott last month.
Company bosses, including Sir Brian Moffat of British Steel, ICI's Sir Ronald Hampel and Keith Orrell-Jones of Blue Circle Industries, believe the tax could be a fatal blow in their attempts to stay in fiercely competitive world markets.
They say that profit margins, particularly in the glass, cement and paper industries, are wafer-thin and the tax will add to the effects of the strong pound, sucking in imports and threatening profits and jobs.
The government expects the levy to raise GBP 1.75 billion in its first full year, starting in April 2001, and reduce the use of carbon-based fuels by 1.5 million tonnes a year by 2010.
Trade associations have little faith in government measures to ease the effects of the tax.
They say the first, a cut in National Insurance, will not offset the cost of the tax because costs are largely in machinery and plant, not labour.
The second, a 50% cut in the levy for high energy-use industries, will still handicap companies in global markets, where competitors do not have the same burden.
Lisa Walters of the Energy Intensive Users' Group said: 'The reduction is dependent on cutting energy use, which will require considerable capital expenditure in clean plant. So in the short term, it is debatable whether it will be a reduction at all.' The tax will be charged per unit of energy.
Customs and Excise says companies will pay 0.21p per unit of gas, 0.6p per unit on mains electricity, and 0.21p on electricity generated from coal directly in manufacturing processes.
Companies claim this will add 40% to their gas bills and 20% to electricity bills.
Ian Rodgers of the UK Steel Association said: 'British companies cannot increase their prices, so they will have to squeeze costs.
'British Steel is already one of the most efficient producers in the world, so it is likely that plants and jobs will be lost.
'It will also hit the UK balance of trade and it is likely that imports will come from lower-cost countries where producers do not have to pay fuel levies.' Keith Wey of the Chemicals Industry Association said: 'The chemical industry's GBP 4.5 billion trade surplus is significantly at risk with the kind of tax rates we are hearing about.
'Pressure on prices is so high that many companies are wavering on the uneconomic. It will push many over the edge.' Cement companies such as Blue Circle, Castle Cement and Rugby Cement also expect to be hit hard. They have weathered industry contraction in the last recession and years of stagnant growth, which have left annual production at 12 million tonnes compared with 18 million a decade ago.

Full text: WHAT ON EARTH is going on in Ottawa these days? Too little.
The Chretien government appears to be floundering, with no agenda, no sense of direction, no action plan for Canada's future.
This is something we simply cannot afford, at a time when profound forces of technology, deregulation and globalization are bringing about major structural changes. These changes are transforming the nature of economies and sources of competitive advantage, which in turn will determine future living standards.
We know that Canada has a problem. We are not productive enough or innovative enough.
The latest indication of this comes from Britain's Institute for Public Policy Research. It has just published its "better off" index, which measures growth and productivity.
With Britain equal to 100, the United States is equal to 128 and Canada to 94. Canada is the lowest in the Group of Seven industrialized countries.
Three policy areas illustrate Ottawa's drift: our poor productivity performance, the mishandling of the future of financial services, and the lack of a plan to meet commitments made in the Kyoto convention on climate change.
Last fall, Prime Minister Jean Chretien stressed the urgency of Canada adopting a productivity agenda, pointing to the connection between investment in innovation and sustained improvements in living standards, including a productivity dividend to support education and health.
Has anyone seen a productivity agenda since then? No, because there isn't one.
Instead, we have had the bizarre spectacle of Chretien more recently suggesting there isn't a problem, that the value of our dollar is nothing to worry about, and, everything's fine.
Yet, surely, the challenge of wealth creation and of good jobs should now be the top Canadian priority.
Now, reports are appearing that the Liberal Party is continuing in its almost visceral hatred of the banks, as if the future strength of our financial system is irrelevant.
Since the Chretien government came to office it has hit banks with a special profits tax that doesn't apply to any other industry, made it difficult for banks to claim research and development tax deductions, blocked bank entry into auto leasing and direct selling of insurance even though this would mean cheaper costs for consumers and blocked mergers.
Finance Minister Paul Martin is right to challenge the banks to meet the needs of Canadian businesses, large and small. There are some real challenges, such as meeting the needs of mid-size companies for debt and equity, and supporting mid-size Canadian companies in export markets.
But Martin appears to have such an intense dislike of the banks that it could interfere with his ability to make objective decisions in the best long-term interests of the country.
Martin appears to reject out of hand the fast-changing competitive landscape facing our banks, including the pressure from both much bigger U.S. and other foreign banks and from single product financial services operators, such as U.S. credit card and mortgage companies.
So, instead of looking at what we need to do to ensure strong Canadian banks, the government seems to regard the banks as Public Enemy Number 1. Likewise, Ottawa's fumbling of the climate change challenge also points to confusion and complacency.
Canada is committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to 6 per cent below 1990 levels by 2008-2012, a commitment made at the end of 1997. Yet we still have no idea how this target will be achieved.
Reflecting the lack of internal co-ordination on the issue, the Chretien government, in this year's budget, rejected a proposal by the National Research Council for strategic initiative in fuel cells, an area where Canada actually is a world leader. The fuel cell offers one of the best ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
In the meantime, the continuing foreign takeover of Canadian companies, which Ottawa regards with complacency, sends a powerful negative message. It suggests that Canadian companies, especially in advanced technologies, aren't capable of making it in the new global economy. So why even try?
And, if Canada seems incapable of getting its act together, more and more young Canadians are entitled to ask why they should stick around instead of heading off to seemingly better opportunities in the United States or elsewhere.
It's time for the Chretien government to wake up. Canada cannot afford Ottawa's complacency.

Full text: SIDEBARS: 1) The `Geritol Solution' 2) Circles of Life
LOOKING OUT OVER his back porch on Great South Bay, Gene Launier pondered the question: What happens when global warming hits home - when the sea rises, the storms get worse, and Venetian Boulevard in Lindenhurst comes to resemble a canal in its namesake city of Venice, Italy?
He pursed his lips and watched the water lapping against the wooden seawall that marks the edge of his bayfront property. "I'm not sure," he said finally. "I guess that's something my children will have to be concerned about."
Global warming is a legacy coming generations will have to deal with
- and not just those who inherit waterfront property. Scientists are still arguing over how fast and how much the Earth will heat up in the coming decades - and what, if anything, we should do to try to slow a trend that has made 10 of the past 15 years the hottest ever measured.
But they do agree that the Earth's climate is changing faster than it has for thousands of years, and that those changes will speed up in the coming century - even if the world moves aggressively to use less coal and oil, the fuels that contribute most to global warming.
The ongoing climate shift is being powered by both a natural warming trend and by human actions, especially the destruction of forests and the burning of fossil fuels that are adding billions of tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide to the Earth's atmosphere every year. The result, for tens of thousands of people who live along the crowded coasts of Long Island, will be an ever-worsening struggle with an ocean that will expand as it heats up.
By the year 2100, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency predicts, the world's oceans will likely rise between one and four feet, with the most likely estimate about two feet. In the New York area, the agency's best guess is that sea level will rise by about 10 inches by 2050. By then, some experts predict, the rising sea and a possible increase in severe storms will drastically transform the 1,350-mile coastline of Nassau, Suffolk and Queens.
For low-lying coastal communities such as Freeport, Bay Shore, Port Jefferson and many others, the projected increase would probably be enough to cause widespread flooding during severe storms.
Forced to either abandon their properties or fortify them with costly, beach-wrecking seawalls, homeowners who decide to stay and battle the ocean may find themselves living on a diked and sand-starved coastline that resembles Venice without the gondolas.
There's even a slim but frightening possibility, acknowledged by the EPA and leading climate experts, that warmer temperatures could unexpectedly trigger a catastrophic melting of polar ice that would raise sea levels by as much as 30 to 40 feet, gradually inundating the world's major coastal cities.
Beyond reshaping the coastline, the predicted 1to 4-foot increase in sea level over the next century could also create new pressures on the water supply by altering the salinity of Long Island's aquifers and New York City's upstate reservoirs. Even miles from the coast, the shifting seas will probably increase flooding because the underground water table will rise as the ocean swells.
As dire as these predictions sound, a rising sea level is just one of the ways in which global warming is likely to transform life and pose daunting challenges for the planet.
"It's certainly the most important environmental issue of the next century." said James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City.
Because the world is heating up, the 21st Century may bring warmer, wetter and wilder weather to Long Island. The current consensus estimate by a United Nations panel is that the average annual temperature worldwide will rise between 2 and 6 degrees by the year 2100, with the most likely guess about 4 degrees. By comparison, the average temperature has risen just 1 degree over the entire 20th Century, and only between 4 and 9 degrees since the last Ice Age ended more than 10,000 years ago.
As the weather changes, so will nature. Plants will grow faster because the extra carbon dioxide enhances photosynthesis, and the growing season may be slightly longer as temperatures slowly climb. Cardinals, kudzu and other animals and plants closely identified with the Mid-Atlantic states will increasingly move northward into our region, and cold-weather species such as birch and beech trees may eventually die off here. Mosquito-borne diseases may gradually become a bigger problem as freezes diminish and the breeding season lengthens.
Finally, heat-related deaths may increase, and so might electricity usage and air pollution from power plants. One computer simulation projects that the number of summer days over 90 degrees in metropolitan New York could jump from the current average of 13 days to 32 days by 2030.
But while those changes will surely seem dramatic in retrospect, we may not notice the climate transformation as we live through it in the coming decades. Compared with the 4.6-billion-year time scale of Earth history, the shift will be dizzyingly fast, yet the warming trend may still be hard to discern from year to year, or even decade to decade. Even on Venetian Boulevard and in other coastal neighborhoods, where the changes will be most obvious, residents may be more likely to attribute erosion or flooding to particular storms, not to the slow warming that may be gradually making those storms stronger and more frequent.
To see the effects of global warming, scientists say, you have to step back and look at the big picture. No one hurricane, heat wave or flood can ever be directly attributed to global warming. The chief cause of worldwide warming - the gradual increase of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere - is just one of the many factors that collectively determine the weather on any particular day in any particular place on Earth.
"Tomorrow's not going to be noticeably warmer than today, and next year's not going to be noticeably warmer than this year. But you wake up in 10 years, or 20 years, or 50 years, and we'll be in a crisis," said Michael Glantz, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and a leading authority on the societal effects of climate change. "That is the problem we're facing."
Maybe that's why on Venetian Boulevard most people seem to think of global warming, when they think about it at all, as something that's just too far off to worry about. "It has kind of crossed my mind, but it seems so far away," shrugs Robert Cunningham, whose bayfront house floods during severe storms. "How do you know it's real?"
Climate change is not new. Long before primitive man discovered fire and sent the first human-induced greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the Earth's climate was shifting between warmer and colder periods in complex cycles that may have been - and still are - driven by changes in volcanic activity and solar radiation, among other factors. The climate cycles are amplified by shifts in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide, methane and other heat-trapping gases that function like the glass panels of a greenhouse by letting in solar radiation while preventing heat from escaping.
Scientists know the "greenhouse effect" plays the dominant role in determining the Earth's temperature, but they aren't sure how much of the current warming trend is the result of the natural climate cycle and how much is being caused by human actions. Many climate scientists, however, believe the human contribution is more important, and will become an even more dominant influence in the next century.
By cutting down carbon-absorbing trees and burning carbon-based fuels such as coal and oil, people are putting more than 6 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere every year, which is why there's 30 percent more carbon dioxide and 150 percent more methane in the atmosphere today than during the mid-1800s. By 2050, the concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere will be twice as high as the pre-industrial level, according to several computer simulations of the world climate system.
In fact, there's already so much momentum toward warmer temperatures that we are going to have to live with the consequences for many years, no matter what we decide to do about reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
For all the controversy over the global warming treaty negotiated in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan - it calls for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012, but has not been ratified by the U.S. Senate - its successful implementation would trim the predicted 4-degree warm-up in the 21st Century by only "a few tenths of a degree," according to Michael MacCracken of the federal Global Change Research Program.
He and other pro-treaty scientists see Kyoto as a first step toward more meaningful emissions cuts, but point out that Earth's climate is so complex that it will take decades even for deeper cuts to slow the warming significantly.
"What we do with respect to this issue is going to have very little effect in the next 50 years," MacCracken said. "The world we're leaving our grandchildren will be somewhat warmer no matter what we do, but if we take aggressive action, the world our grandchildren will be leaving to their grandchildren will be more stable and not changing so much."
But even though the evidence is overwhelming that the world is warming, and that the trend is picking up speed, there's still plenty of uncertainty about how far and fast the warming will occur, and how well the natural world will adapt to climate change.
One of the biggest unanswered questions is the effect of volcanic eruptions and factory smokestacks, which may be partially offsetting the effects of global warming because the particles they spew into the air reflect some incoming solar radiation back into outer space. Nor do researchers understand why levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere are increasing at a slower rate today than they did 25 years ago, even though human activities are releasing more of those gases into the atmosphere every year. One possible explanation: because the amount of farmland in the northern hemisphere has dropped in the 20th Century and reforested acreage has risen, the additional trees may be absorbing the excess carbon dioxide.
Despite the uncertainties, most climate scientists say they are gaining confidence in their broadest predictions about the future impact of global warming because over the past decade they've been able to document yearly increases in temperature and carbon dioxide. "Things are certainly becoming somewhat clearer than they were 10 years ago," NASA's Hansen said.
For Long Island, local experts predict that the most important future consequences of life in the global greenhouse will involve the water that laps at our shores and courses through underground aquifers.
"Sea-level rise and water resources - those are going to be the major impacts for Long Island and New York City," said Vivien Gornitz, an associate research scientist at Columbia University and a sea-level specialist. The oceans are rising mainly because water expands as it heats up, although a slight melting of polar ice has also contributed to the increase. Since 1900, sea level in metropolitan New York has risen by about 1 foot, which is faster than the global average, because geologic pressures are causing the eastern edge of North America to sink very gradually.
By 2100, a Columbia computer model suggests, the ocean may be 4 feet higher than it is now, although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's official estimate for the New York region is for an approximate 23-inch increase. A 4-foot rise would be enough to inundate 7,000 square miles of dry land in the continental United States - equivalent to flooding the entire state of Massachusetts.
Even more ominous for coastal propertyowners is that storm flooding may get worse. The still-controversial but generally accepted theory among climate scientists is that as global warming adds moisture to the atmosphere, there will probably be more heavy downpours and hurricanes. But because so many factors influence the weather, studies have not found a consistent pattern of worsening storms as temperatures have climbed in recent decades. Still, many experts predict that storms will become more frequent, and nastier, as the Earth continues to warm.
"There's a lot of uncertainty, but the likelihood is that Long Island would be significantly wetter. That's about as specific as you can get," said Robert Cess, a climate researcher at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
Nicholas Coch, a professor of geology at Queens College who specializes in coastal issues, is more definite: "We're going to have to learn to live with rising sea level, a predicted greater frequency and intensity of nor'easters, and also a greater frequency of Atlantic hurricanes."
What that may mean for Long Island, in Coch's opinion, is that if waterfront homeowners are allowed to protect their properties at any cost, by 2025 virtually all of the region's coastline will have seawalls instead of sandy beaches. The only exceptions will be the public parks, where there will be enough room for the eroding beach to retreat and form again farther inland.
As in Holland or Venice, seawalls protecting private property will have to be continually heightened and strengthened to hold off the rising tide. That would not only be a financial and recreational disaster, it would also destroy coastal wetlands that are essential habitats for fish and birds.
Eventually, Coch said, the costs of seawalling will soar so high that large areas of the coastline will, inevitably, be abandoned. "To a geologist, the answer is very simple: The ocean always takes the land, regardless," he said. "In the long run, Mother Nature always wins."
That idea apparently has not been accepted by most Long Islanders. According to the Newsday Future Poll, 44 percent of 800 Long Islanders surveyed by Louis Harris & Associates Inc. think global warming will be a "major problem" for the region in the future, but 51 percent think it will be either a minor problem or no problem at all. And despite warnings from experts that the current coastline will eventually have to be abandoned if the sea level keeps rising, 54 percent of Long Islanders support using public money to try to hold the shoreline in place. Only 43 percent think nature should be allowed to take its course if erosion and floods increase in the future.
On a recent drive along the South Shore, Gornitz marveled at the amount of rebuilding that has taken place since the devastating nor'easters of the early 1990s. "It's like these people are in denial that this will ever happen again," she said.
Along Venetian Boulevard, which flooded heavily during the nor'easters of 1992 and 1993, few property owners have made any concessions to the encroaching waters of Great South Bay. Battered seawalls have been rebuilt and flooded basements refurbished. Backyards feature boat docks and living rooms are decorated with model sailboats.
When Thomas and Carleen Gregg bought a fire-damaged home last year and decided to raise the foundation 3 feet before rebuilding the house, a neighbor laughed. "He told me I was crazy to do it" because of the extra cost, said Carleen Gregg. "I can't say we raised the foundation because of global warming. We did it to get a reduction on our flood insurance - plus, I really don't want my house to flood."
But if the climatologists are right and storms become more frequent, even a 3-foot boost may not be enough to protect the Greggs' house well into the next century.
The reason inland areas also will be affected is that as the ocean heats up and expands, saltwater will push into underground freshwater aquifers, said Henry Bokuniewicz, director of the Long Island Groundwater Research Institute at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
Water companies that operate wells near the coast may have to choose between desalinating their water or digging new wells farther inland. In addition, the entire aquifer system will be compressed upward, raising the water table. That could have some beneficial effects by reviving some streams and ponds that have been dry for decades, ever since overpumping by water companies lowered the water table. But the rising groundwater will also flood more basements and expand swampy areas, according to Bokuniewicz.
New York City's water-supply system may also become more vulnerable if saltwater gradually creeps farther up the Hudson and Delaware Rivers. That could prompt riverside communities to exercise their right to tap into the city's upstate reservoirs, and risk depleting them. The reservoirs will also be hurt if warmer temperatures mean more rain but less snow, because slowly melting snow adds more water to the system than drenching rains, which run off quickly, according to Huntington engineer Douglas Hill, a climate-change consultant to the Manhattan-based Regional Plan Association.
Long Islanders may end up feeling the consequences of global warming most strongly because of events that will occur thousands of miles away, some researchers suggest. Through immigration and investment, the metropolitan area is closely tied to poorer, warmer countries, where climate change is likely to bring the most suffering. Low-lying areas such as Bangladesh and the river valleys of China may be inundated by rising seas, and agriculture there may be crippled by heat and insects. "Developing countries are not going to be as resilient to climate change as the United States, and because of these strong international couplings, New York is going to feel the impact," MacCracken predicted.
But no place on Earth will be immune if the warming trend unexpectedly zooms ahead at breakneck speed, instead of proceeding relatively slowly as predicted. Studying fossils and other geologic evidence, scientists have found evidence of sudden and drastic climate shifts, possibly triggered by volcanoes or asteroid strikes. Climatologists agree that it's highly unlikely that the ongoing buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will lead to a similarly abrupt switch. But they worry that the Earth's climate is so complex and poorly understood that the possibility of catastrophic circumstances can't be ruled out.
One remote possibility is that warming temperatures could unexpectedly cause the melting of thousands of square miles of ice sheets in Greenland and western Antarctica, where there is already some evidence that the ice is receding. If those two ice sheets melted, sea level, by most estimates, would rise 30 to 40 feet - enough to wipe out the world's major coastal cities.
Under another nightmare scenario, the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could spur a huge increase in plant growth, and the decomposition of those plants could then further boost the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and cause a runaway greenhouse effect.
Even scientists who consider global warming a grave threat think such events are unlikely. But they say there's no avoiding the fact that the world will have to make difficult decisions about whether to abandon or fortify low-lying areas, and how to balance the benefits and the costs of phasing out oil and coal, the principal fuels implicated in global warming.
On Venetian Boulevard, few homeowners seem inclined to give up their waterfront perches. Past storms have put 2 feet of water in his utility room and flooded his backyard so completely that ducks were swimming on his deck, but Gene Launier said he has no plans to move, come hell or high water.
"I think that's the attitude most people have," he said. "We love it and we're going to try to stay, no matter what happens in the future."
Coming Monday: Your Views on Global Warming
Coastline Concerns
No one knows for sure how future increases in sea level will alter Long Island's coastline. But these maps project what could happen over the next century in several representative communities if global warming increases sea level rise as predicted, and if Long Islanders let nature take its course instead of building dikes, raising up waterfront property or otherwise trying to hold off the rising sea.
The maps show two effects: how the coastline would recede over the next 50 and 100 years as the tide level advances, and how flooding from major "50-year" storms -- which occur on average only twice a century -- would become more severe.
The maps are based on the most widely accepted scientific projections for sea level rise and for a 50-year flood. The estimates of future sea level rise come from a 1992 report by a United Nations panel, and have been adopted by the federal government as its official "best-guess" projection. The report projects that sea level will rise approximately 10 inches by the year 2050, and 23 inches by the year 2100. The estimates for a 50-year flood assume storm tides from six to 11 feet above sea level, and were developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Because the maps are based on existing conditions along the coast, they don't take into account ongoing erosion or wave action from storms. In other ways the maps may underestimate the impact of global warming on the coastline: They do not assume that storms will become more severe and frequent as global warming proceeds, and they do not take into account more dramatic computer models, including one developed by NASA that suggest the water level increase may be four feet by 2100. These maps were created by Jay Tanski, a coastal specialist at New York Sea Grant, a joint program of the State University at Stony Brook and Cornell University. He was assisted by Henry Bokuniewicz, a SUNY-Stony Brook professor.
Bay Shore The Bay Shore marina and the tip of Penataquit Point could disappear within 50 years as sea level rises, and by 2100 many homes near Watchague, Penataquit, Awixa and Orowoc Creeks could meet the same fate without intervention.
Port Jefferson Rising sea level may eventually swamp the ferry terminal and other waterside businesses, while slightly increasing the area flooded during very severe storms.
Freeport The ground floors of homes on canals may be inundated within 50 years, while some offshore islands would disappear (possibly reforming elsewhere). The flood plain for severe storms may expand inland by about one block.
Bayville Rising tides may swamp beach parks, expand Mill Neck Creek and shrink Centre Island. Flooding from a very severe storm might wash over eastern Bayville and detatch western Bayville from the mainland. **** THE FUTURE POLL SHORELINE SUPPORT If erosion and floods increase in the future, should public money be spent to keep the coastline as it is or should nature be allowed to take its course?

Abstract: Insurance companies confirm what any newspaper reader already knows: tornadoes, flooding rains, devastating winds, and other weather-caused disasters have generated record-breaking losses; the American middle-west experienced spring in December while Europe dug out of a record-breaking winter storm; Canadian authorities have predicted that the terrible ice storm of January 1998, which afflicted most of New England and Canadas northest, will prove to be just the first of many.

Full text: The average temperature of the earth's atmosphere in the first nine months of 1998 reached the highest levels every recorded. The "frozen tundra" is defrosting. Glaciers are disappearing.
In Alaska, roadside utility poles, destabilizing by the melting, lean at crazy angles, as do trees, creating what have been called "drunken forests." Antarctica is warmer now than at any time in the last 4000 years.
Floods afflicted 56 countries and at least 45 suffered severe drought. Worldwide economic losses from violent weather totaled an estimated $72 billion during the first seven months of 1997. The outbreak of infectious diseases like cholera, dysentery and malaria is attributed to climatic disruption.
Insurance companies confirm what any newspaper reader already knows: tornadoes, flooding rains, devastating winds, and other weather-caused disasters have generated record-breaking losses; the American middle-west experienced spring in December while Europe dug out of a record-breaking winter storm; Canadian authorities have predicted that the terrible ice storm of January 1998, which afflicted most of New England and Canadas northest, will prove to be just the first of many. What in the world is going on?
That question is going to be addressed in depth by The Global Climate Change in Maine Conference, to be held at the Ramada Conference Center in Lewiston on April 7-8. The conference will focus on the climate change in Maine: What is it? What is the state of the science? How might it affect Maine citizens, businesses and resources? What are some strategies to avoid or adapt to the potential risks and respond to the challenges?
Forty-eight organizations and institutions are sponsoring the conference, including federal and state government agencies, business and trade organizations and some 24 nongovernmental organizations covering a broad range of economic and industrial sectors as well as environmental interests. Conference facilities will accommodate about 400 persons, of whom about half will be from the general public.
Plans for the conference foresee two full days of discussions, in plenary sessions and workshops, covering such subjects as likely impacts of climate change on Maine forests, coastal and marine ecosystems, agriculture and food supply, tourism and public health; avoidance strategies for a wide range of energy production and use sectors, the role of public opinion and how to continue conservation. Technical specialists from academia, government and industry will serve as resource persons for each plenary and workshop session.
A unique feature of the conference will be a poster exhibit, in which participating organizations will display graphic elaborations of their presentations.
The Conference on Global Climate Change in Maine is one of the first national efforts to examine the issues in the context of a particular state's interest and economy. Conference organizers expect that other states will follow Maine's groundbreaking lead.

Abstract: BRITAIN'S BIGGEST energy users are seeking an exemption from the new climate change levy proposed in this month's Budget in return for signing binding agreements to improve their energy efficiency. Industry representatives rejected the offer of a 50 per cent reduction in the energy tax proposed by the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, at a meeting yesterday. "We are disappointed the Government has linked energy efficiency agreements to the tax, and we are looking for a zero rate of tax," said Graham Funnell, head of environmental policy at the UK Steel Association, one of nine sectors represented at the meeting.

Full text: BRITAIN'S BIGGEST energy users are seeking an exemption from the new climate change levy proposed in this month's Budget in return for signing binding agreements to improve their energy efficiency.
Industry representatives rejected the offer of a 50 per cent reduction in the energy tax proposed by the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, at a meeting yesterday.
"We are disappointed the Government has linked energy efficiency agreements to the tax, and we are looking for a zero rate of tax," said Graham Funnell, head of environmental policy at the UK Steel Association, one of nine sectors represented at the meeting.
But Mr Prescott said industry had already benefited from substantial reductions in energy prices. "Companies will be able to exchange part of their liability for the climate change levy in return for commitments to environmental gain," he said.
The objections to the environmental tax, which comes into force in April 2001, follow the row between the Government and road hauliers over vehicle excise duty for heavy lorries announced in the Budget.
Lisa Waters, economic adviser to the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG), said: "It is important people understand it was not a win, win Budget. It was lose, lose if you work in manufacturing. The Government has failed to grasp the effects of this tax on the competitiveness of UK manufacturers."
The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Treasury are to hold further meetings after Easter with industry representatives, including steel, chemicals, paper, glass and food manufacturing.
One of the objections is that the climate levy is not fiscally neutral. Although the revenues raised will be returned to industry through a fall in employers' national insurance contributions, most energy-intensive businesses employ relatively few people.
British Steel estimated that in the worst case the levy would cost the company pounds 200m to pounds 300m, compared with a pounds 5m saving on its NI bill.
The industries are also alarmed that the Government plans to impose the tax on companies that meet energy use targets. This would raise costs at a time when much of industry is struggling with the effects of the strong pound and recession inimportant markets overseas.
Some major foreign rivals are also unburdened by efforts to meet the international climate change targets. These include China, Brazil, Korea and India.

Abstract: Britain's big energy users yesterday warned John Prescott, deputy prime minister, the new climate change tax could cause serious harm to their businesses. Representatives from sectors such as steel, paper and chemicals, told Mr Prescott that even a 50 per cent discount in the energy tax would hit their competitiveness. Mr Prescott is considering offering a 50 per cent reduced rate to the biggest energy users, providing they agree to make substantial cuts in their fuel use.

Full text: Britain's big energy users yesterday warned John Prescott, deputy prime minister, the new climate change tax could cause serious harm to their businesses.
Representatives from sectors such as steel, paper and chemicals, told Mr Prescott that even a 50 per cent discount in the energy tax would hit their competitiveness.
The tax will cost some companies millions of pounds a year, and ministers acknowledge that they will have to give special help to the biggest energy users.
Mr Prescott is considering offering a 50 per cent reduced rate to the biggest energy users, providing they agree to make substantial cuts in their fuel use.
It is thought the discount could be even greater for those companies which come up with imaginative schemes for improving their energy efficiency. But even the offer of large discounts has not appeased many industry leaders, who made their concerns known at a meeting with Mr Prescott and other ministers yesterday.
"Even a 50 per cent lower rate would have a substantial competitiveness impact for intensive users," said Fiona Davies, the Confederation of British Industry's energy adviser. "There was a frank exchange of views, but all the trade associations want to be constructive and to reach a negotiated agreement with the government."
Mr Prescott wants to use the tax system to win environmental improvements, and is confident he can reach deals with industry by the autumn.
The tax, which will raise about £1.75bn a year, will be introduced in April 2001, and is intended to help Britain meet its international climate change obligations.
The deputy prime minister told the industry leaders that they were already benefiting from lower fuel prices, and that they would all benefit from becoming more energy efficient. He also offered to take into account energy savings already achieved by industry, and to consider giving special treatment to energy-intensive processes such as electrolysis in the chemicals sector.
The government intends the tax to be revenue neutral and to compensate companies through a cut in employers' national insurance contributions. But big energy users claim they would recoup only about 10 per cent of the full energy tax through the NIC rebate.
Ms Davies said: "The message being given very clearly this morning was that the rate will have to be below 50 per cent for this tax to be tolerable to big energy users.
"We hope they will take on board the issue of UK competitiveness during the negotiations."
Mr Prescott has been put in charge of striking a deal with each of the nine trade associations representing the big energy users. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: John Prescott, deputy prime minister, will today seek to quell industry concern over the new energy tax by offering 50 per cent discounts to big companies that cut their fuel bills. Mr Prescott will tell Britain's biggest energy users that they can pay a reduced rate of the new "climate change levy" if they adopt more energy efficient systems. Industry has already bombarded ministers with complaints about the energy tax, announced in the Budget, and due to come into force from April 2001. Big energy users have complained that the levy, which is designed to help meet Britain's international obligations on climate change, will hit their competitiveness.

Full text: John Prescott, deputy prime minister, will today seek to quell industry concern over the new energy tax by offering 50 per cent discounts to big companies that cut their fuel bills.
He is leading the first attempt by government to use the tax system as a negotiating tool with industry to meet its environmental objectives.
Mr Prescott will tell Britain's biggest energy users that they can pay a reduced rate of the new "climate change levy" if they adopt more energy efficient systems.
It is understood the standard rebate could be about 50 per cent, although Mr Prescott may offer even bigger reductions to imaginative companies that "go the extra mile".
His offer will be made at a meeting with representatives of Britain's biggest energy users, including manufacturers of steel, chemicals, glass and cement, and the food and drink sector.
Industry has already bombarded ministers with complaints about the energy tax, announced in the Budget, and due to come into force from April 2001. Big energy users have complained that the levy, which is designed to help meet Britain's international obligations on climate change, will hit their competitiveness.
A consultation exercise by Customs and Excise suggests coal and gas prices would need to rise by the equivalent of 0.21p per kilowatt hour, and electricity by 0.6p, to raise the anticipated £1.75bn a year. It will be offset by an equivalent cut in employers' national insurance contributions.
However, Gordon Brown, the chancellor, acknowledged that there needed to be "special consideration for energy intensive sectors, given their energy usage and exposure to international competition".
Ministers want to strike a deal with nine separate trade associations. "We have never tried anything like this before," said one government official. "This is ground breaking stuff, but we believe we can achieve our aims."
The food and drink sector and the paper industry are among those believed by government advisers to have the biggest scope for energy savings. Tube plans attacked, Page 9 Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

What in the world is going on?
That question is going to be addressed in depth by the Global Climate Change in Maine Conference, to be held in the Ramada Conference Center in Lewiston on April 7 and 8.
The conference will focus on climate change in Maine: What is it? What is the state of the science?

Forty-eight organizations and institutions are sponsoring the conference, including federal and state government agencies, businesses and trade organizations and some 24 nongovernmental organizations covering a broad range of economic and social sectors as well as environmental interests.
Conference facilities will accommodate about 400 persons, of whom about half will be from the general public.
Plans for the conference involve two full days of discussions, in plenary sessions and workshops covering such subjects as likely impacts of climate change on Maine's forests, coastal and marine eco- systems, agriculture and food supply, tourism and public health; avoidance strategies for a wide range of energy pro- duction and use sectors; and cover the role of public opinion and how to continue the conversation.
Technical specialists from academia, government and industry will serve as resource persons for each plenary and workshop session.
A unique feature of the conference will be a poster exhibit, in which participating organizations will display graphic elaborations of their presentations.
The Conference on Global Climate Change in Maine is one of the first national efforts to examine the issues in the context of a particular state's interests and economy. Conference organizers expect that other states will follow Maine's groundbreaking lead.

Full text: Government spin does not always stand up to scrutiny. A row this week over the Treasury's treatment of the working families tax credit as negative taxation, rather than a positive component of public spending, has undermined Gordon Brown's claim that this year's Budget has cut taxes by £4bn. Opposition MPs say taxes are rising. The chancellor flatly rejects this. Whom do we believe?
Economists say the answer to whether taxes are going up or down depends on how you see the world.
The Budget Red Book defines the tax burden as net taxes and social security contributions. These, it says, will fall as a percentage of GDP over the coming financial year from 37.2 per cent to 36.6 per cent. Thereafter, the burden increases to 37 per cent by 2001-02.
The main reason for next year's fall is not the chancellor's tax-cutting bonanza, but the effects of economic slowdown. The pace of economic growth affects tax revenue. The contribution from corporate taxes will diminish because of the slowdown, only to recover again as activity picks up. The final instalment of the government's windfall tax on the privatised utilities is paid in the current financial year. It drops out of the equation next year, helping ease the tax burden.
Increased revenue later is in part due to a phenomenon known as fiscal drag, or the automatic increase in the government's revenue take that comes with economic growth in a tax system not indexed to real earnings. This tends to increase the tax burden over time. Also, the introduction of self-assessment for individual taxpayers has led to a permanent increase in the tax base as those who evaded or avoided paying under the old system have been caught.
The chancellor's own actions have an effect. But although trumpeted measures such as the new 10p starting rate of income tax, a reduction from April 2000 in the standard rate of income tax from 23p to 22p, and a cut in employers' National Insurance contributions reduce direct taxation, indirect taxes are rising.
"There have been big increases in some areas of the indirect tax burden as a result of this and previous Budgets. The rise in fuel and tobacco duties are part of pre-announced increases that more than offset cuts in direct taxes," says Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies.
This compositional shift is deliberate; the cut in NI payments, for example, is funded by a "climate change" levy, effectively an energy tax on pollutants. While the latest Budget measures reduce the tax burden by £3.6bn by 2001-02, measures announced in previous Budgets due to take effect after this one raise the tax yield by £7.7bn over the same period. The government says it is moving the tax burden from "goods" to "bads".
The rhetoric is relatively easy to follow. What complicates things is how the government has done its sums.
The Treasury's definition of the tax burden is not the only one. Official statisticians who produce the UK national accounts disagree with the chancellor on how he has presented his figures.
The working families tax credit, the Office for National Statistics says, should be accounted for as public spending, not negative taxation as the Treasury believes. According to the ONS, the credit affects non-taxpayers and is therefore not an integral part of the tax system. The new childrens' tax credit falls into the same category, it says.
Mortgage interest relief, to be abolished in April 2000, should also be presented as public expenditure. The government does not dispute this, though it included Miras in calculating taxes as a proportion of GDP.
Take these three elements out and the level of taxation looks different: the fall in the coming financial year is not quite as sharp, but the increase later is steeper. Go one stage further by excluding the windfall tax and making other technical changes to move fully to the national accounts basis, and receipts actually rise in the next financial year.
So, what of the chancellor's claim that his measures have cut taxes by a net £4bn? This is calculated by subtracting the increases in indirect taxes from the cuts in direct taxes he has announced. It includes the increase of about £1.5bn in the working families tax credit and excludes the effect of abolishing Miras. It also flatters Mr Brown. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

Alaska Struggles to Recover, 10 Years After Exxon Valdez; Environment: Prince William Sound's fishermen still feel the effects of largest maritime oil spill in U.S. history.: [Home Edition]

Abstract: Amid oil-blinded sea otters and beached whales and the limp black carcasses of 250,000 shorebirds came the slow, sure swim of the pink salmon. The 1990 run was 44.5 million fish, the highest on record, almost four times higher than the year before 11 million gallons of oil spilled into Prince William Sound. Maybe it wasn't all the fault of (Joseph) Hazelwood, who left the bridge that night and turned the mammoth tanker over to an inexperienced third mate. Or the third mate, who gave a delayed order to execute a turn to the helmsman. Or the helmsman, who didn't make the turn the way he was supposed to. Maybe it wasn't the three days of good weather that were lost before Exxon and port officials got the cleanup truly underway. Maybe it wasn't the fact that hot-water washing of the beaches hurt the shellfish more than if they had simply been left alone. Brian O'Neill, the Minneapolis lawyer who is the lead attorney for the tens of thousands of plaintiffs who are waiting for Exxon to pay the judgment, calculates that the company already has collected $780 million in insurance and an estimated $2 billion in tax write-offs on the spill. By spending years appealing the case, Exxon also is earning interest on the money it hasn't paid. O'Neill figures Exxon will have earned the full $5 billion in another two to three years.

Full text: A year after the Exxon Valdez ground onto a reef in the middle of a frigid March night in 1989, unleashing the worst environmental disaster in U.S history, a striking thing happened.
Amid oil-blinded sea otters and beached whales and the limp black carcasses of 250,000 shorebirds came the slow, sure swim of the pink salmon. The 1990 run was 44.5 million fish, the highest on record, almost four times higher than the year before 11 million gallons of oil spilled into Prince William Sound.
The next year was so high that Alaska fishermen couldn't find cannery space and were sending excess fish to Russia. Herring, the backbone of the North Pacific food chain, flooded fishing nets as well. What in the name of God, people wanted to know, was going on?
Then came the third year--the year the pinks didn't come back. There were barely enough fish to warrant sending out the boats that year and again in 1993, when just 7 million fish swam home. Herring collapsed. The 100,000 metric tons of fish that made their way back to spawn before the spill shrank to 16,000 tons in 1993--and the herring still there were plagued with weird lesions and erratic swimming patterns.
That's when Ron Anderson knew the spill wasn't over. What he is starting to realize now is that it may never be over.
"We dumb fishermen told them this was going to happen. They left us this mess, and here it's 10 years later and we're still in a mess," said Anderson, a lifelong Cordova fisherman who sold his boat earlier this month because hardly anyone can make a living fishing Prince William Sound anymore.
"They keep talking about recovery," scoffed Sylvia Lange, a former supply boat operator. "What about all the ones that died? The sea otters clawed their eyes out. The birds pecked their chests until you could see their hearts beating under their feathers. It was a holocaust. And you can't recover from a holocaust."
It was 10 years ago, on March 24, 1989, when the 987-foot Exxon Valdez pulled out with a load of 53 million gallons of North Slope oil and headed into the icy waters of Valdez Narrows, veering from the shipping lanes in the treacherous strait to avoid an iceberg.
Capt. Joseph Hazelwood's midnight radio transmission still echoes here, like the last words from the Challenger space shuttle crew or Neil Armstrong's first words from the moon. "We're leaking some oil, and we're going to be here for a while."
Full Effect of Spill Still Being Tallied
In the years since, Exxon Corp. has paid out about $3.5 billion in cleanup costs, fines, settlements and compensatory damages while appealing the largest punitive damage judgment ever awarded in the U.S. courts: $5 billion due to 34,000 Alaskans who suffered because of the company's alleged negligence. The ecological impact on the 15,000-square-mile sound is the most studied in history, producing conflicting prognoses ranging from near-recovery to fears of genetic and reproductive damage that could linger for generations.
What is clear, in the remote towns and villages that surround the scene of the largest maritime oil spill in American history, is that almost nothing is what it was before that night.
Maybe the seals would have died anyway, facing a loss of food supplies because of an unusual rise in ocean temperatures in the years before the spill. Maybe the herring would have died anyway, competing with hatchery fish for food. Maybe the fishing industry would have collapsed anyway, when the price of pink salmon, in the face of a worldwide glut, plunged from $1.10 a pound to 5 cents.
Maybe it wasn't all the fault of Hazelwood, who left the bridge that night and turned the mammoth tanker over to an inexperienced third mate. Or the third mate, who gave a delayed order to execute a turn to the helmsman. Or the helmsman, who didn't make the turn the way he was supposed to. Maybe it wasn't the three days of good weather that were lost before Exxon and port officials got the cleanup truly underway. Maybe it wasn't the fact that hot-water washing of the beaches hurt the shellfish more than if they had simply been left alone.
Try blaming a cosmic coincidence of errors, misjudgment, climate change, global economics and 10.8 million gallons of oil for what happened to these 7,300 residents of southern Alaska and they'll likely look back with the kind of stare that greets all departures from the realm of the obvious. Call it what you want, that look says. Just make it go away. Make it be 10 years ago again--no, 10 years and an hour ago.
Dissecting a Disaster
"Technological disasters are considerably different from natural disasters. A natural disaster, once you clean up the hole in the yard or the fire or the flood, you move on. In a technological disaster, there isn't a definite source {of harm} out there. There isn't a Red Cross to tell us when things are right or wrong," said Margy Johnson, a Cordova innkeeper and ex-mayor.
"It's been described as a marathon, and my neighbors are exhausted runners," she said. "The oil companies, every two years you get a new face. They're fresh and ready to go. But I don't know who Exxon is. It's nobody I've ever been able to sit down and talk to. It could very well be that they're bigger than the government and they don't have to be a good corporate citizen because they're already bigger than God. But I don't know. I've never met Exxon."
For their part, Exxon officials wonder what they could have done that they didn't. How can a company go in after a spill, they ask, take full responsibility, spend $2.2 billion cleaning it up, pay $300 million in settlements to anyone who claims they were injured, pay $125 million in fines and penalties and a $900-million civil settlement with the government--and still be found liable for punitive damages, let alone $5 billion?
"Clearly, we had an effect on people's lives and livelihoods that there was considerable anger about, with considerable justification," said Frank Sprow, Exxon's vice president for environment and safety. "But we did make every effort to compensate those people that were damaged. . . . One of the very first things we did was to ask fishermen in Cordova, 'What's your annual fishing revenue?' They'd say, 'X.' And we'd say, 'For a start, here's X.' "
Since then, he said, the company has moved to improve its crew training, emergency preparedness and navigation procedures. Crew members with a history of counseling for alcohol abuse, like Hazelwood, are moved out of safety-critical jobs.
"The award is 200 times the largest award ever affirmed by any federal court anywhere," said Los Angeles attorney John Daum, who will argue the appeal for Exxon before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. "The Supreme Court says you can have a large award only in the face of reprehensible conduct, intentional fraud, trickery, violence or personal injury to the plaintiffs. There's none of that here. This was an accident."
Brian O'Neill, the Minneapolis lawyer who is the lead attorney for the tens of thousands of plaintiffs who are waiting for Exxon to pay the judgment, calculates that the company already has collected $780 million in insurance and an estimated $2 billion in tax write-offs on the spill. By spending years appealing the case, Exxon also is earning interest on the money it hasn't paid. O'Neill figures Exxon will have earned the full $5 billion in another two to three years.
"Exxon is about the 26th biggest institution on the planet, and that's counting governments. . . . I think it galls them in their heart of hearts that they're subject to the same justice system as everybody else is," he said.
Environmental Groups Fault Industry
O'Neill, who stands to take a substantial share of the $1.02 billion in legal fees due out of the judgment, said it is the only case he has handled in 25 years in which the defense has not made a single offer to settle. Instead, he said, Exxon has pursued an exhaustive strategy he describes as "the my-sister defense."
"I didn't hit my sister, and if I did, it wasn't my fault, and if it was, I didn't hurt her," O'Neill explained. "We monitored Hazelwood because of his drinking, but even if we didn't, his drinking had nothing to do with it, and even if it did, we cleaned up the oil, and even if we didn't, oil doesn't hurt fish."
Environmental groups in Alaska also have been critical of the industry's slow move to double-hulled tankers, which would reduce the chances of a disastrous spill in the event of a collision or grounding. The 1990 federal Oil Pollution Act, the most direct consequence of the Valdez spill, clarified liability for oil spills and imposed stiffer fines. It requires double hulls for all U.S. ships by 2015. But only 40% of the fleet has converted, according to the Tanker Advisory Center in New York. Exxon has not placed a single order for a double-hull vessel.
Nor has the reach of the Valdez's poisonous oil stopped at the shores of Prince William Sound. It is present in the small New York office where the 52-year-old Hazelwood, still regarded by his colleagues as one of the most capable skippers ever to captain a tanker out of Alaska, works as a claims adjuster for a maritime law firm.
Other jobs--as a yacht delivery captain or an instructor at a merchant marine academy--didn't last long. Not when the public or the press found out it was Hazelwood. "They get me as the anti-Christ . . . the patron saint of the bad guys," he told the Seattle Times not long ago. Hazelwood declined to be interviewed for this story.
Gregory T. Cousins, who never explained his delay in ordering the simple right turn that Hazelwood commanded before leaving the bridge, is now working for another company as a second mate. Helmsman Robert Kagan Jr., who compounded the problem by under-steering the turn, retired from Exxon in 1995 and worked recently on an oil-spill cleanup ship.
And Hazelwood is left to remember the phone call from Cousins on the bridge--"I think we're in serious trouble"--and minutes later, the sharp jolt of metal on rock, a sickening grinding sound, and his own automatic response: Grab onto something. Throw up. Go back up to the bridge and try to do something about the black hell seeping out of the bottom of the ship.
Cordovans are the first to admit that Exxon-funded scientists may be right when they point to signs of biological recovery of the sound. It's what isn't recovered that people here keep seeing.
"We are looking at the same sound, and we're seeing it half-empty rather than half-full," explained Riki Ott, a biologist and author from Cordova.
"It's clean all right. It's clean of what we had," said Anderson, the fisherman. "Prince William Sound was so alive, it was just unreal. Killer whales, thousands and thousands and thousands of birds. But now you have to go halfway to Kodiak to see anything. Prince William Sound is clean. It's devoid of all wildlife. You see sea gulls, and that's all you see. . . . They live off dead things."
To be a salmon fisherman in Cordova in the 1980s was to be one of the anointed. Live in one of the loveliest settings in God's imagination--a ring of snow-clad, forested peaks rising out of the aquamarine of Prince William Sound--and spend your summers in the sea air on a boat built by your father. Expect to earn $100,000 straight out of high school in a good season, for five months of hard work.
Fishermen earned good money, but most risked everything they had to get it; a good boat cost $400,000; a salmon fishing permit cost upward of $300,000.
Robert Maxwell did so well that he had two salmon permits, and both his sons had their own boats. Maxwell's plan was to sell his boat and permits to finance a comfortable retirement. Now they are worth almost nothing--and Maxwell is living on Social Security.
A Struggle to Survive
The boys are still fishing. In 1992, the first year the salmon crashed, his son Robert caught 500,000 pounds of fish, grossing $60,000, with the coincidental drop in salmon prices. The crew got paid $24,000, insurance was $12,000, $9,000 went into fish cooler costs. Net profit at year's end: $1,500.
"Since 1989, I haven't been able to {put} one dollar into a savings account or a college account or a retirement account," Robert said. "Here I am turning 40 years old; I got a daughter going to college next year."
Kevin O'Toole had worked as a crewman for eight years to save for a down payment on his own fishing permit. But before the spill, he couldn't find anyone willing to sell. He and his wife, Linden, also a fisherman, wrote letters to every salmon fisherman in the sound, offering to buy a permit. When O'Toole finally found someone willing to sell, he drove 140 miles through a blizzard to close the deal--at $300,000. They signed the papers in February of 1989. Then came the spill.
They sold the permit for $48,000 and have limped along trying to make payments to the bank on the rest. O'Toole went back to work as a deckhand. Linden got a job as a real estate agent, hoping to hold out until the Exxon judgment money comes in, if it ever does.
"A high-liner used to be a guy who caught a lot of fish," she said. "Now it's a guy whose wife has a job."
Cordova, the nation's seventh-most-lucrative fishing harbor the year before the spill, with an average of $44 million in revenue a year, slipped to 51st in 1993, its earnings down an average of $19 million a year since the spill. A former mayor committed suicide. The city of 2,500 has gone through six mental health directors.
In many minds, Cordova's story is one of economic disaster as much as environmental ruin. Salmon have come back in very good numbers in several years since the crashes of 1992 and 1993, largely due to a mass infusion of hatchery fish (wild fish are few, even now). It is the collapse of salmon prices that has been most hurtful, due primarily to a shrinking Japanese market and a worldwide glut resulting from the introduction of farmed salmon, argued Gunnar Knapp, economics professor at the University of Alaska and a leading market analyst.
That doesn't explain why the herring have yet to come back in any substantial numbers. Nor does it address Native Alaskans in the nearby villages of Tatitlek and Chenega Bay, who for thousands of years have depended on the bounty of the sound for their daily food, regardless of what it can be sold for.
On the island of Chenega, with its beaches still full of oil-soaked rocks, villagers now have to boat for miles to find a seal, once a staple for food and pelts. Only recently have they begun eating shellfish again. "We just got to the point where we eat 'em anyway. If we're gonna die, we're gonna die," said Pete Kompkoff, a member of the tribal council.
In the years since the spill, the population of the remote village has shrunk from 94 to 35 as residents, unable to maintain a subsistence lifestyle, have moved across the sound to the port of Valdez, terminus of the trans-Alaska pipeline, and taken jobs.
"You can't imagine everything that was here before. Seal. Crab. Shrimp. Sea urchin. Now, the sound is forever quiet," said Gail Evanoff, tribal council president. "There was a time before the spill, you'd listen to the sea otters, you'd see seals. . . . I sometimes wonder, what kind of cultural legacy has this interrupted? What will be left for my kids?"
The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, charged with overseeing scientific studies and habitat restoration funded by Exxon's $900-million settlement with the government, has painted a generally bleak picture of what has happened in the sound in the decade since oil fouled 1,300 miles of shoreline, killing more than 250,000 seabirds, at least 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 150 bald eagles and 14 to 22 killer whales, along with billions of salmon and herring eggs.
It lists only two of 28 species affected by the spill as fully recovered: the bald eagle and the river otter. Eight species, including killer whales, harbor seals and common loons, have made little or no progress. Others, ranging from sea otters to herring, have made significant progress but have not yet reached pre-spill levels.
But a number of scientists, including those hired by Exxon and some working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, think the trustee council is wrong to wait for species to number what they did before the spill before they can be considered recovered. For one thing, no good studies exist to document what those pre-spill numbers were, they say. For another, a wide range of environmental effects other than the spill could have produced population shifts--much as population numbers in Prince William Sound have fluctuated dramatically throughout the century.
Thus, they advise measuring recovery by looking at whether fish, animals and plants in oiled areas are exhibiting the same general trends now as those in areas that weren't washed with oil. In a good many cases, they are.
"We've seen very substantial recovery of the sound, and I really believe that the trustees' report very much leaves an erroneous impression," said Exxon's Sprow, noting that it fails to mention the large number of species not affected at all by the spill, including as many as half of the 100 bird species there.
Detailed biological work undertaken by Ernest L. Brannon at the University of Idaho, funded by Exxon, looks at the controversial decline of pink salmon in 1992 and concludes it could not have been a result of the spill, since the record-high returns of 1990 and 1991 included fish that had emerged as newly hatched eggs just after the spill and hatchery fish about to be released, many of them theoretically exposed to oil.
Brannon and David Page, a chemistry professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, argue that it was the advent of huge releases of hatchery fish competing for food supplies, beginning in 1987, that led to the collapse.
A key new development in the debate was the release late last year of a study by National Marine Fisheries Service scientists working at Juneau's Auke Bay Laboratory. Those scientists were able to document for the first time that exposing salmon eggs to even very low levels of a particularly toxic type of hydrocarbon residue found in the oil could produce effects ranging from mortality to delayed development, slower growth, lesions and cancer as well as impairment of their ability to reproduce.
Jeffrey Short, one of those who led the study, said the results could help explain the salmon collapse of 1992-93, and in particular, higher salmon mortality that was documented in oiled streams. But Page says the study erred by assuming oil was what caused these toxic effects. Bacterial byproducts, such as ammonia, could have produced the same result, he said.
Stan Senner, the trustee council's science coordinator, refuses to accept that salmon and herring haven't fallen victim to Exxon Valdez oil.
"Exxon likes to point out that harvests of salmon have been very high. Well, this is {nonsense}, because what they're including is all of the hatchery-reared fish. . . . If they were just talking about the wild stocks, the picture is not nearly so rosy," he said.
In fact, he said, hatchery fish have made up 66.5% to 86.5% of all the salmon returning to the sound since the spill, compared with 10% to 56% before the spill.
Sitting in the dining room of the Reluctant Fisherman, overlooking Cordova's quiet harbor, Johnson, the former mayor, declined to enter the debate. "For a million bucks, science will tell you anything that you want to hear," she said.
Next summer and in the following four summers, Hazelwood will be back in Alaska, picking up trash along the roadways, paying off the 1,000 hours of community service that was ordered as part of his misdemeanor criminal conviction.
Alaskans have mixed feelings about it. Cordova fisherman Ross Mullins, for one, can't even imagine what he'd say to Hazelwood if he passed him on the street. "I wouldn't know what to say to the man," he said, chuckling. "I just hope there would be a big puddle there when I drive by."

10 Years After the Spill
When the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef on March 24, 1989, it was transporting 53 million gallons of Alaskan North Slope crude oil to California. The spill dumped 10.8 million gallons of the tanker's cargo into Prince William Sound, eventually damaging 1,300 miles of shoreline. More than $2 billion was spent cleaning up and restoring coastal habitats. Since then, regulations have been adopted governing tanker design and oil spill prevention. The Exxon Valdez is banned from Prince William Sound and has been renamed Mediterranean, after the sea it has been operating in since 1990.
****
NEW STANDARDS FOR TANKERS
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 set stricter standards on oil tankers. All new tankers are now required to have an extra hull contained within their outer hulls. The Exxon Valdez was a single-hulled tanker.
The space between the hulls is intended to be a buffer if the outer hull is penetrated in a collision with rocks or another ship.
If the Washington Monument was paper-thin, the 10.8 million gallons of spilled of (1,444,000 cubic feet) would fill it to the top.

Clean air chokes manufacturing While Gordon Brown's new industrial energy tax will affect every business in the land, the biggest winners are in the services sector

Abstract: And it won't be a trifling amount. In the greenest budget for years, the Chancellor announced a tax on industrial energy use. Illustrative prices suggest a levy of around 15 per cent on companies' electricity bills, 30 per cent on gas bills, and a massive 50 per cent on coal bills. All electricity suppliers will have to add the tax to their bills - even hydro-electric power stations and windfarms. The Chancellor quickly passed over the politically sensitive tax in his Budget speech, but in scale and scope it dwarfs all the other much-hyped business measures put together. While both the research and development tax credit and the 10p corporation tax for small businesses will cost the Treasury pounds 100 million a year each, the industrial energy tax will raise pounds 1.7 billion in its first year. The aim of the tax is not to raise money, but to get companies to cut their use of energy, thus helping to fulfil Britain's international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Government reckons that the new tax will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1.5 million tonnes a year.

Full text: IN A COUPLE of years, every British business from your local corner shop to Unilever will see a change in their electricity, gas and coal bills. As well as entries for VAT and 'total due' there will be a new item - 'climate change levy'.
And it won't be a trifling amount. In the greenest budget for years, the Chancellor announced a tax on industrial energy use. Illustrative prices suggest a levy of around 15 per cent on companies' electricity bills, 30 per cent on gas bills, and a massive 50 per cent on coal bills. All electricity suppliers will have to add the tax to their bills - even hydro-electric power stations and windfarms.
The Chancellor quickly passed over the politically sensitive tax in his Budget speech, but in scale and scope it dwarfs all the other much-hyped business measures put together. While both the research and development tax credit and the 10p corporation tax for small businesses will cost the Treasury pounds 100 million a year each, the industrial energy tax will raise pounds 1.7 billion in its first year.
Every business, from cog-wheel makers and accountants to farms - as well as local authorities and Government offices - will be affected. Only domestic customers, charities and public transport will be exempt.
The aim of the tax is not to raise money, but to get companies to cut their use of energy, thus helping to fulfil Britain's international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Government reckons that the new tax will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1.5 million tonnes a year.
Faced with protests from industry and fears of Britain being made uncompetitive by higher fuel costs, the Chancellor agreed to recycle the revenue raised by cutting employers' National Insurance contributions (which he had raised in his previous Budget) from 12.2 to 11.7 per cent.
Overall, he will give back as much money cutting taxes on employment as he raises by taxing the use of energy. The Government calls it shifting the burden of taxation from 'goods' to 'bads'.
Business groups - which had been dreading the tax - welcomed the fact that it had been introduced in a way that is 'revenue neutral'.
But although UK plc will get as much money back as it pays out, that doesn't mean each company will: there will be many winners and losers.
Fiona Davies, environment policy officer at the CBI, said: 'The overall assumption is that if you are energy-intensive, not labour- intensive, you are likely to be a loser.' Heavy industry, which uses a lot of energy but employs few people, will be faced with significantly higher costs, but will not get much of the rebate on National Insurance contributions. Service sector companies such as banks and supermarkets - who employ lots of people but use little energy - are likely to end up winners.
'It's a big cross-subsidy from manufacturing to services,' said Lisa Walters, economic adviser to the Energy Intensive Users Group.
At its crudest, the climate change levy can be seen as a tax on blue-collar jobs and a subsidy for white-collar ones. What's more, the timing couldn't be worse: manufacturing is already mired in recession. 'A tax that transfers money from manufacturing to services is the last thing the economy needs,' said Paul Reeve, head of environment at the Engineering Employer's Federation. If the Chancellor had recycled all the money raised by subsidising energy- saving equipment it would have helped industry more.
The obvious answer for a company facing higher bills is to become more energy-efficient - precisely the sort of behaviour the tax was designed to encourage. Environmentalists reckon British businesses could easily reduce energy use by 20 per cent.
However, many businesses protest that they have already done all they can. Russell Luckock, chairman of Birmingham engineering firm AE Harris, said: 'There is no way on this earth we can use less electricity unless someone develops a new type of power press. I do not know of a way we can economise more. The tax will just add to costs.'
The structure of the tax means that the bigger energy users - who get bulk discounts - will suffer a disproportionate increase in their bills. It will add just 23 per cent to bills for small gas customers, but up to 40 per cent for big ones. On electricity bills, the tax ranges from 11 per cent for low users to 23 per cent to high ones.
For the most intensive users, such as steel and chemicals, the tax could add huge costs with little chance of improving efficiency. 'Reducing energy use is a boardroom issue already,' said Walters. 'We'll do what's technically possible. For many intensive users, the only response is to reduce output.' One of the Government's few likely concessions is a cut in the levy for intensive energy users.
However, experience elsewhere in Europe suggests that companies have considerable scope to cut their energy use. Over the past decade Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have all introduced or made plans to introduce an energy tax.
Government studies into the effects of these taxes show the beginning of significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.
British companies have also benefited from a sharp fall in energy prices over the past 20 years. According to the Department of Trade and Industry, the price of electricity has fallen 37 per cent, and gas a staggering 67 per cent since 1980. Environmentalists argue that businesses have simply been reducing their energy bills by sitting back and waiting.
'Energy efficiency has dropped off the agendas of a lot of boardrooms,' says Chris Hewett, environment research officer at the Blairite think-tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, which has been influential in pushing for the energy tax. 'The levy will make energy management part of companies' investment plans.'
He says manufacturers have little reason to complain of being unfairly hit by the tax: 'They've been subsidised by excessive energy use for many decades, and the vast majority, even in manufacturing, will benefit from the cuts in NI contributions.'
The Government remains acutely sensitive to accusations of crippling industry with new taxes. By consulting widely, and making sure it has the backing of heavy hitters such as Lord Marshall, chairman of British Airways, it has managed to silence the harshest criticism. There are few votes in environmental policies these days - and many brickbats in being anti-business. The reason for the Government's determination to face the political risks of the new tax is summed up in its impact assessment, published last week.
'The Government considers that doing nothing is not an option. The economic costs of climate change could be substantial, and greater than the cost of action.'

Now for Gordo's latest trick: taking from the rich to give to the poor (but don't call it redistribution)

Abstract: So now we know. The much mocked Third Way does mean something. It means accumulating Budget surpluses while spending more on targeted tax credits, popular public services and cuts in the basic rate of income tax. And if there is a New Labour big idea it is about making work pay for those on low incomes. But there are the first signs of clouds on the horizon. After last week's Budget Mr Brown is approaching the limit of the tax breaks, allowances and national insurance anomalies that can be exploited to allow him stealthily to raise taxes on upper income Britain to redirect to those on lower incomes that New Labour considers deserving. Even last week he bought headlines with some specious fiscal wizardry; quietly abolishing the 20 per cent band of lower rate income tax to finance his eye-catching new 10 per cent lower rate for a tiny net gain, while sitting on the proceeds of the abolition of the married couples' allowance for a year in order to finance his penny off income tax, before giving back the cash in his new children's tax credit.

Full text: So now we know. The much mocked Third Way does mean something. It means accumulating Budget surpluses while spending more on targeted tax credits, popular public services and cuts in the basic rate of income tax. And if there is a New Labour big idea it is about making work pay for those on low incomes.
And whatever the cynicism from left and right alike, it's an approach that for the moment yields rich political dividends. Just glance at the latest opinion polls. This is a political centrism that keeps enough of Labour's old political base more or less happy, while denying Conservatives any political openings or leverage. Small wonder New Labour is so pleased with itself.
But there are the first signs of clouds on the horizon. After last week's Budget Mr Brown is approaching the limit of the tax breaks, allowances and national insurance anomalies that can be exploited to allow him stealthily to raise taxes on upper income Britain to redirect to those on lower incomes that New Labour considers deserving. Even last week he bought headlines with some specious fiscal wizardry; quietly abolishing the 20 per cent band of lower rate income tax to finance his eye-catching new 10 per cent lower rate for a tiny net gain, while sitting on the proceeds of the abolition of the married couples' allowance for a year in order to finance his penny off income tax, before giving back the cash in his new children's tax credit.
They are the harbinger of things to come. From now on his choices about winners and losers will be harder to disguise, and the ambiguities more difficult to sustain. And cumulative intrusive impact of the means-testing that accompanies any Brown social programme of tax credits or job subsidies will become more onerous. If Mr Brown's reputation sinks, those will be among the reasons.
But for all that there is a lot to applaud in the Budget. The Chancellor `locked in', as the Budget Red Book declaims, the further improvement in the Government's budgetary position by budgeting for
an accumulated current surplus the difference between current
spending and taxation over the next five years of pounds
34billion.
Part of this is due to lower social security spending; part to lower debt interest; part to a sunnier view of future economic growth; and part to the consequence of the tax increases he made in his first two budgets. But for surpluses of that dimension to be consistent with five years of planned real public spending growth of
2.75 per cent a year the longest period of such a high
sustained increase in public spending since the 1960s is
remarkable.
Of course spending growth should be higher still given the rank dilapidation of the public sector and the strength of public finances, but the Chancellor remains famously attached to `prudence'. Nor is the largess to be returned to the tax payer; the giveaway this year is a trivial pounds 1billion, rising to pounds 1.4billion next year, when the penny off the standard rate of income tax kicks in.
But these small net figures disguise the vast movements of cash he has initiated by his dramatic reforms of the tax and national insurance system. When all the changes are implemented next year, he will will have reduced taxes and national insurance contributions by a gross pounds 7.4billion and raised them by a gross pounds 6billion, leaving a net giveaway of pounds 1.4billion. The upshot is that broadly the rich are paying more, and pensioners and families on below average incomes significantly less. The Chancellor, under the rubric of fairness which he refuses to call redistribution, has redistributed income as determinedly as Old Labour.
He has been particularly bold over the national insurance system. At last the threshold for paying national insurance and income tax is to be aligned at pounds 87 per week, an important rationalisation of what has been a standing joke for years. Introducing national insurance on benefits in kind raises a useful pounds 440million an obvious reform but one Tory Chancellors never made. And the pounds 1.7billion raised by 2001's Climate Change levy on industrial carbon dioxide polluters a courageous measure is to be passed on directly in an almost exactly compensating cut in employers' national insurance contributions.
Beyond that the measures become more contentious, and start to expose the more choppy economic and political water the Chancellor is entering. He was right to abolish Miras, which has few friends in an era of low interest rates and buoyant house prices. But entry into the housing market is ever more forbidding with high house prices, and without assistance first time buyers with better-off parents and relatives to help them, will continue to get into the market more easily than those less well connected. This careless upward twist to inequality could have been cushioned by a small package to help first-time buyers; Labour must watch that the Tories do not capitalize on the omission.
Then there was, rightly, the abolition of the married couples' allowance. And the new children's tax credit of pounds 8 a week will be withdrawn from higher rate tax payers, raising more than taxing child benefit would ever have done. Neat, but with two disadvantages: it will not be paid to mothers, and it extends by one more ratchet the principle of means-tested benefits.
This is New Labour's Achilles' heel. The Brave New World of giving tax credits to the deserving certainly has the advantage of helping the poor without using the dread words `increasing benefit', and of targeting funds where they are needed. But it also implies a wholesale and systemic increase in means testing. Employers will gain information about their workers that their work forse might want to remain secret; some single parents will be uneasy about telling their boss they have children in order to claim the tax credit in their pay packet. Pensioners claiming the minimum retirement income guarantee, and workers qualifying for working family tax credits, may have similar worries.
In short these new tax credits and guarantees are not citizens' entitlements resulting from collective social insurance against risks we all confront. They are discretionary payments paid by the state because it considers the recipient deserving, and can be withdrawn and fiddled with as the state thinks fit. It is an important redefinition of the basis of the Welfare State.
One justification is that for the population of working age it is a way of rewarding work, but for all the hullabaloo about the working family tax credit and the new deal for the over fifties, the numbers who will benefit are small. Some 30,000 over fifties may have their income topped up by the job subsidy. Perhaps 50,000 families will claim the working family tax credit. The numbers of disabled helped by, yes, the new disabled person's tax credit are harder to calculate, but again will not be great. Nor is it clear they have anything but a marginal effect in promoting work incentives.
And what of those who cannot work? For example, there are 2.5 million men and women over 50 either unemployed or economically inactive, most living on income support. Their benefits have steadily fallen in real terms as they have been linked to the rise in inflation rather than wages; the prosperity that follows in the wake of rising productivity and wages have passed them by completely. For them the Budget held nothing; they are not considered deserving. The Chancellor instead chose to cut the standard rate of income tax.
It is a clear political choice. The first three Brown Budgets certainly witnessed a substantial and welcome redistribution of income, but it has been focussed largely on those in work. Moreover, it has been bought at the cost of re-establishing means testing as the core principle by which the disadvantaged qualify for help, while social security benefits have continued to dwindle in real terms.
Gordon Brown has an attachment to symmetry; corporation tax now has three neat rates of 10, 20 and 30 per cent. The temptation to reproduce that neatness with income tax at 10, 20 and 40 per cent is obvious.
There is no point in high tax for the sake of it but if the Third Way comes to imply means testing, a basic rate of income tax of 20 per cent and still decaying schools it may deserve its mockery. That's not what it should mean and Gordon Brown should not allow himself to be seduced by last week's headlines into interpreting it that way.

The fiscal backdoor: It is not the amount but the direction of Gordon Brown's backdoor redistribution that matters: [London edition]

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/fiscal-backdoor-is-not-amount-direction-gordon/docview/248670249/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: The buzz words on the fiscal policy of the British chancellor, Gordon Brown, have been "redistribution by stealth". What this means is that he has redistributed income and resources to the poorer members of the population, or those regarded as worthy, by means of backdoor tax increases that the middle or upper range of taxpayers has not noticed - or at least accepted. In other words, he has avoided headline increases in tax rates with which old Labour used to be associated. Indeed, he has just announced a post-dated 1 per cent cut in the basic rate of income tax and further cuts in corporation tax rates. Two different questions arise. First, is the redistribution justified? Second, how has he managed to get away with it? Some Labour spin doctors talk as if any redistribution is self-evidently justified; some right-wing commentators as if it is all a dreadful sin. But unless you regard the distribution of wealth produced by the accidents of inheritance and changes in market scarcities as inherently just, some public policy is required.

Full text: The buzz words on the fiscal policy of the British chancellor, Gordon Brown, have been "redistribution by stealth". What this means is that he has redistributed income and resources to the poorer members of the population, or those regarded as worthy, by means of backdoor tax increases that the middle or upper range of taxpayers has not noticed - or at least accepted.
In other words, he has avoided headline increases in tax rates with which old Labour used to be associated. Indeed, he has just announced a post-dated 1 per cent cut in the basic rate of income tax and further cuts in corporation tax rates.
Two different questions arise. First, is the redistribution justified? Second, how has he managed to get away with it? Some Labour spin doctors talk as if any redistribution is self-evidently justified; some right-wing commentators as if it is all a dreadful sin. But unless you regard the distribution of wealth produced by the accidents of inheritance and changes in market scarcities as inherently just, some public policy is required.
All Conservative chancellors have presided over a good deal of redistribution - indeed their normal reply to charges of widening income differences was to point out that those differences were much narrower after tax and social security were taken into account.
On the other hand, unless your ideal is complete equality (obtainable only in the graveyard) the direction of the redistribution does matter, as well as its effects on incentives.
There are some deeper issues which there is not space to discuss here, but are analysed in my longer works (Essays, Moral, Political and Economic, Edinburgh University Press) . One is the case for some stability in the rules of the game - preferably extending over several parliaments and different political regimes. The other is whether more of the redistribution in an affluent society could be in the form of cash - via what Mr Brown has at long last called a minimum income guarantee - and less in the form of free public services in kind that are still part of Labour's mantra.
The nature of the redistribution in the past couple of years is very much what is popularly assumed - towards children and the working poor. A purist liberal might say that a decision to have children is a personal matter that the state should not encourage or discourage. But an equally good liberal reply is that children did not ask to be born and poverty today is heavily concentrated among families with children, especially one parent or unemployed or one income ones.
This desirable redistribution has been marred by three measures of gesture politics. They are:
* The insistence on a 10 per cent starting band for income tax;
* The extra-large Working Families Tax Credit for mothers who go out to work;
* The minimum wage.
It has often been demonstrated that the best way of helping low income families is by higher benefits; and the next best one by raising the tax threshold by more than the chancellor has done: the least efficient of all is the low tax band. What the three have in common is that they are pieces of baggage that Labour did not manage to drop in the course of its policy reviews and have attained the sacred status of manifesto commitments, not to be questioned by advisers or civil servants who want to be listened to on other matters.
A more favourable verdict is possible on how the revenue has been raised. The main way of raising revenue without raising marginal tax rates is by removing or reducing allowances. This does mean that those affected start paying the basic rate of tax, lower down in the income scale; but at least they do not find that extra effort or initiative is penalised by the 70-90 per cent marginal tax rates that used to obtain and that have been almost eliminated at the bottom as well as the top of the income scale.
Moreover, a good many of the reliefs affected were, like the so-called married allowance or mortgage interest relief, simply concessions to special interest groups that distorted the economy and which most Conservative chancellors would have liked to abolish if the prime minister of the day had allowed them.
How has the chancellor got away with the squeeze on the middle classes whom Tony Blair attracted to Labour? An important reason is that the main squeeze on personal disposable income took place in the first year or two of Labour rule when there was still euphoria about the change of government. The potentially most unpopular move - the withdrawal of the tax credit for pension funds - was announced in the first 1997 Budget.
It is often said that employees will only notice it when they retire and find their pensions less than they expected. But for those in earnings-related schemes the proximate cost will have to be borne by employers and the ultimate effects diffused through the economy.
Mortgage interest relief had already been heavily squeezed by Conservative chancellors after Lady Thatcher's departure, so its elimination is not felt as a big deal. The blows have been further softened by the reductions in short-term interest rates which have reduced mortgage payments before tax. These of course are not a free lunch. The adverse effects are felt by millions of people with small savings accounts who will now receive less.
On the whole the government has done a good job at satisfying its traditional constituencies without imposing new burdens on business and enterprise and in some ways actually reducing them. One can say this even if one is sceptical about the special breaks for the fashionable "winners" of today, such as information technology. They have made the tax system and the grant system needlessly complicated and have created an accountants' benefit bonanza.
The total net so-called budget giveaway is best seen from the figure of £3.6bn which is the Treasury's estimate of the annual impact net of all the measures by 2001-02. There are a few big revenue raisers. The most important are the tax on the business use of energy (known in New Labourspeak as a "climate change levy"); the end of mortgage interest relief and the increased employee upper earnings limits for National Insurance. All these three are to be welcomed.
Another source is the reduced estimates for social security benefits. These arise partly from tightening up and partly from the trend to lower unemployment evident since the mid-1990s. A further source is lower national debt interest, which is ultimately due to lower inflation where the present trend set in - as the "Red Book" charts themselves demonstrate - during the last parliament. They may all be threatened in the medium term by the trend to re-regulation coming from London as well as Brussels.
But the biggest source of all is "fiscal drag", namely the automatic increase in the government's revenue take that comes with economic growth in a tax system not indexed to real earnings. This source would of course be threatened if world economic shocks reduce growth even below the more cautious of the chancellor's alternative projections, as they easily could. For instance, every 1 per cent shortfall of growth below forecasts is estimated to add a cumulative £6bn per annum to Treasury borrowing. The right course would then be to sit it out and base policy on the cyclically-adjusted estimates despite the difficulty of explaining these to the cruder spirits in the media and the financial world.
Overall, the broad direction of fiscal policy under Mr Brown has been right, but it has been marred by new Labour's nannyish tendency to tell people what is good and bad for them. It is also not helped by a propagandist form of presentation that makes it unnecessarily difficult to ascertain what is really happening under all the froth. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

BUDGET 2: Consumption: Energy tax heralds climate of change Roger Cowe examines the thinking behind new levy

Abstract: A SURCHARGE on electricity, gas and coal purchases will apply to all but domestic and transport users from April 2001, following the Budget announcement of an energy tax. A binding target of a 12.5 per cent reduction by 2010 was agreed at the Kyoto summit in 1997, while the Government has made a voluntary commitment to a 20 per cent cut. The Treasury estimates that the new energy tax will produce a 2 per cent saving; a small step towards the ambitious 20 per cent target. It is seen by the Government and environmentalists as symbolic of a fundamental shift in the approach to taxation.

Full text: A SURCHARGE on electricity, gas and coal purchases will apply to all but domestic and transport users from April 2001, following the Budget announcement of an energy tax.
The aim of the `climate change levy' is to encourage greater energy efficiency and help achieve government targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 levels.
A binding target of a 12.5 per cent reduction by 2010 was agreed at the Kyoto summit in 1997, while the Government has made a voluntary commitment to a 20 per cent cut.
The Treasury estimates that the new energy tax will produce a 2 per cent saving; a small step towards the ambitious 20 per cent target. It is seen by the Government and environmentalists as symbolic of a fundamental shift in the approach to taxation.
Friends of the Earth seized on the measure as evidence that the Government had accepted the logic of using the Budget to affect behaviour. Patricia Hewitt, the Treasury minister with responsibility for environmental matters, talked of shifting from the neutral levying of taxes on all goods and services to taxing `bads' such as pollution.
Industry remains to be convinced of the value of such a move, although placated by the promise that the sums raised will be returned in the form of a half percentage point cut in employers' National Insurance contributions.
Heavy users of energy, typically capital-intensive industries such as chemicals and steel, were quick to state that the formula discriminated against them. In effect, it will be a levy on manufacturing industry to provide a subsidy for services.
Lisa Waters, economic adviser to the Energy Intensive Users' Group, dismissed the Government's offer of a reduced tax rate for heavy users who come up with plans to improve energy efficiency. Yesterday she called for complete exemption from the new levy for such users.
The indicative rate of 0.6p per kilowatt hour of electricity purchased would add about 17 per cent to the average fuel bill of a major electricity buyer. Ms Waters said the new electricity trading regime which comes in next year could have helped to bring prices down by a third by the time the climate-change levy hits.
Big business still hankers after a system of emission permits which could be traded between companies, allowing organisations to choose between cutting energy use and paying for permission to pollute.
This idea has not been ruled out by the Government, but will take several years to develop.

Abstract: A NEW energy tax on business was yesterday placed at the heart of the Government's strategy to curb pollution and clean up the environment. He said Budget measures would cut levels of carbon, the main greenhouse gas, by three million tonnes. The energy tax, which is to be introduced from April 2001, would account for half that reduction. Mr [Gordon] Brown also announced other measures to tackle pollution, many of them focusing on harmful fumes from transport. The combined effect of petrol price increases and excise duty concessions for small cars and clean lorries and buses is intended to reward environmentally- friendly practice, particularly where it involves using ultra-low sulphur diesel.

Full text: A NEW energy tax on business was yesterday placed at the heart of the Government's strategy to curb pollution and clean up the environment.
Chancellor Gordon Brown said the levy would help to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 12.5% by 2010, in line with Government commitments.
He said Budget measures would cut levels of carbon, the main greenhouse gas, by three million tonnes. The energy tax, which is to be introduced from April 2001, would account for half that reduction.
The new levy will be based on the recommendations contained in a report by British Airways chairman Sir Colin Marshall, who was called in to study the issue at last year's Budget.
The details will be finalised after consultation with businesses, though Mr Brown insisted they would face no overall rise in the burden of taxation because of a parallel decrease in employers' National Insurance contributions from 12.2% to 11.7%.
He added that there would be lower rates of tax for energy intensive sectors to encourage them to improve energy efficiency.
Mr Brown also announced other measures to tackle pollution, many of them focusing on harmful fumes from transport. The combined effect of petrol price increases and excise duty concessions for small cars and clean lorries and buses is intended to reward environmentally- friendly practice, particularly where it involves using ultra-low sulphur diesel.
Mr Brown also announced reforms to encourage the use of fuel efficient company cars.
To cut pollution, employees will from this year be able to get tax-free benefits from employer run or employer subsidised buses, car sharing schemes, and other environmentally-friendly means of getting to work, such as public transport and cycling.
The current discounts for business mileage are to be abolished, removing the incentive to drive more miles. In 2002, taxes will be linked to emission levels on a "revenue neutral basis".
Mr Brown also announced that the landfill tax, currently #10 per tonne, would rise in future years by #1 a tonne.
He concluded that the net effect of the Budget changes announced yesterday would lead to a #4000m tax cut.
Friends of the Earth Scotland said the Budget contained "some steps in the right direction but could not be described as radical".
Head of research Dr Richard Dixon welcomed measures aimed at tackling climate change, such as the carbon tax and company car reforms, but said more could have been done to protect the environment.
He said "gas guzzling" cars could have been hit harder and added that a rumoured aggregates tax would have constrained damaging quarrying operations, such as that proposed for Lingerbay on Harris.
Transport pressure group TRANSform Scotland questioned the lengthy timescale for implementing some proposals and said there should have been measures to encourage sustainable development.
A spokesman for the Confederation of British Industry in Scotland expressed concern that the energy tax could harm productivity and competitiveness by placing unfair burdens on business.
He suspected that it would turn out to be a "blunt instrument", which would not tackle problems associated with energy use, though he looked forward to responding to the consultation exercise.

Abstract: His recommendations included the suggestion the minimum earnings threshold for contributions should be aligned with the single person's tax allowance so those not eligible for tax should also not be liable for NI contributions. Changes in this direction will start from April 2000, when employees earning less than #76 will pay no NI contributions. For the following year, this will be raised to #87, which will be in line with the single person's tax allowance. By then, those earning around this allowance will be about #160 a year better off. At the same time, the upper limit of earnings liable to NI contributions will be raised to #535 a week in 2000/01 and to #575 the following year. The contribution rate remains at 10% or 8.4% for those contracted out of Serps on earnings between the lower and upper thresholds. Contracted-out employees earning over the top contribution limit will be #4.55 a week worse off in 2001/02.

Full text: THE changes in National Insurance contribution rules are based on the conclusions of the report compiled last year by Mr Martin Taylor, until recently the chief executive of Barclays Bank.
His recommendations included the suggestion the minimum earnings threshold for contributions should be aligned with the single person's tax allowance so those not eligible for tax should also not be liable for NI contributions.
Changes in this direction will start from April 2000, when employees earning less than #76 will pay no NI contributions. For the following year, this will be raised to #87, which will be in line with the single person's tax allowance. By then, those earning around this allowance will be about #160 a year better off.
"This will increase the rewards from work, helping to ensure that work pays, even for those on low incomes," the Chancellor said.
At the same time, the upper limit of earnings liable to NI contributions will be raised to #535 a week in 2000/01 and to #575 the following year. The contribution rate remains at 10% or 8.4% for those contracted out of Serps on earnings between the lower and upper thresholds. Contracted-out employees earning over the top contribution limit will be #4.55 a week worse off in 2001/02.
By then, however, 900,000 people will be taken out of paying contributions altogether. Their benefit entitlements will not be affected as a zero rate will be applied to earnings between the current lower limit and the new threshold.
The employers' contribution rate will be cut from 12.2% to 11.7% from April 2001. The Government also proposes to widen the perks net on which contributions are payable. Currently, this covers just company cars and fuel but others such as health insurance and subsidised loans will be included.
The Government is specifically linking the reduced rate of employer contributions directly to the climate change levy on energy use by companies. The one will cancel out the other.
"This shift of the tax burden from employment to energy should help provide the right conditions to encourage employment whilst promoting the efficient use of energy," the Treasury stated.
As for the self-employed, NI arrangements will be moved more into line with employees. The sudden imposition of the Class 2 flat-rate #6.35 contribution once profits reach #69 has caused resentment among low earners and this will be cut to #2 from April 2000. The Chancellor hoped this would encourage more people to start up on their own.
The point at which Class 4 payments start will be aligned with the personal tax allowance, as with employees, by 2001. Similarly the upper limit will rise to #575 and the rate will go up from 6% to 7%. Self-employed people earning under around #9460 will be better off as a result of the changes.
The Government also proposes to extend to the self-employed NI insurance rights to the full maternity allowance.
Mr Brown said that, in the longer term, the Government aimed to simplify the NI and tax rules to reduce the administrative burden on employers. Proposals will be contained in the next Pre-Budget Report

Mr Generosity has something in here for everyone; Brown gives handouts to business and the unemployed: [2 Edition]

Author: Ian McConnell Deputy Business Editor

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/mr-generosity-has-something-here-everyone-brown/docview/332525828/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: In only a few weeks' time, a 10% income tax band will be introduced to make work pay for low earners. The basic rate will be cut from 23p to 22p in the pound from April next year. The long-threatened married couple's allowance will finally be abolished next year - for all apart from pensioners - but it will be replaced eventually by a children's tax credit. This move was not a great surprise, nor was Mr Brown's decision to take advantage of extremely low interest rates to abolish mortgage interest tax relief (MIRAS) without causing too much pain. The introduction of a 10p-in-the-pound lower income tax band will cost #1.5bn in the coming fiscal year and #1.8bn in each of the following two years. The reduction in the basic rate to 22p will cost #2.25bn in 2000/01 and #2.8bn in the year to April, 2002.

Full text: PENSIONERS, families, and entrepreneurs were the big winners in the last Budget of the 20th century.
But there was something for everyone as Chancellor Gordon Brown, in a generous mood enabled by the healthy state of the public finances, pulled one rabbit after another out of his briefcase.
In only a few weeks' time, a 10% income tax band will be introduced to make work pay for low earners. The basic rate will be cut from 23p to 22p in the pound from April next year.
The long-threatened married couple's allowance will finally be abolished next year - for all apart from pensioners - but it will be replaced eventually by a children's tax credit. This move was not a great surprise, nor was Mr Brown's decision to take advantage of extremely low interest rates to abolish mortgage interest tax relief (MIRAS) without causing too much pain.
The value of this tax break to homeowners has been reduced gradually in recent years, as has the beneficial impact of the married couple's allowance.
In spite of these abolitions, the Budget was expansionary. Measures announced yesterday will cost the Exchequer #1.06bn in the tax year beginning on April 6, #1.38bn during the following 12 months, and #3.56bn in 2001/02.
The introduction of a 10p-in-the-pound lower income tax band will cost #1.5bn in the coming fiscal year and #1.8bn in each of the following two years. The reduction in the basic rate to 22p will cost #2.25bn in 2000/01 and #2.8bn in the year to April, 2002.
But the replacement of the married couple's allowance with the children's tax credit will help meet these costs. Taking 2000/01 and 2001/02 together, this change will save the Exchequer #2.25bn.
This is largely because the children's tax credit is not being introduced until April, 2001 - a full 12 months after the married couple's allowance bites the dust. This cunning move by Mr Brown will save him #1.6bn in 2000/01 and leave him the option of bringing forward the introduction of the new credit in next year's Budget.
Abolition of mortgage interest relief, from April next year, will boost the Treasury's coffers by #1.35bn in 2000/01 and by #1.4bn during the following 12 months.
Enterprise and fairness, the pillars upon which last year's Budget was built, were once again to the fore. Mr Brown highlighted his determination to redress the neglect of the importance of wealth creation by left-wing governments of the past and also the "indifference" towards public services and fairness by those of the right.
He skilfully combined hand-outs to business with measures to help the unemployed, notably the over-50s this time, out of the poverty trap created by the social security and taxation systems and back into work.
All taxpayers will benefit from the introduction of the 10% income tax band, which will be levied on the first #1500 of taxable income.
Changes to be introduced over the two years from April, 2000, will ensure that those who do not earn enough to pay income tax do not have to make National Insurance contributions either. These will cost the Chancellor #850m in the first year and #1.8bn in 2001/02. But simultaneous moves will mean high earners will have to pay about #750m more in 2001/02, and an extra #430m the previous year.
Employers will benefit from a reduction in their main contribution rate from 12.2% to 11.7% from April, 2001 - a move which will cost the Chancellor #1.7bn that year but will be paid for by a "climate change levy" on businesses' use of energy.
Meanwhile, over-50s who re-join the workforce after more than six months on the dole will be guaranteed an income of at least #9000 during their first year back in employment.
Pensioners must have thought it was Christmas. About eight million pensioner households will benefit from a hike in the winter fuel allowance from just #20 to #100 from this year. This will cost #640m per annum. Meanwhile, a single pensioner's personal allowance was raised to #5720 and elderly couples who both use their allowances to the full will not be taxed on combined income below #15,000.
Lone pensioners will, from April 6 next year, be guaranteed a minimum income of #78 a week. The figure for elderly couples is being raised to #121.
The Chancellor pointed out that these moves meant the annual minimum incomes would, respectively, be nearly #500 and almost #800 higher than when Labour came to power. He said a typical pensioner household would be about #240 a year better off.
In a surprise move, a 10% rate of corporation tax is being introduced from April, 2000, for companies earning annual profits of up to #10,000. Those earning between #10,000 and #50,000 will also benefit from an average tax rate lower than the 20% smaller companies levy which takes effect on April 6 this year.
About 270,000 small and growing companies will benefit. Such firms represent the majority of Scottish businesses.
Mr Brown said 85% of the beneficiaries had fewer than 10 employees, but these would be the ones which would drive job creation.
The 10% starting band is the lowest rate of company taxation in any major industrialised nation. This was the key measure in a package aimed at helping entrepreneurs and boosting their number. But it will cost only #100m in 2001/02 - the first year it will impact on the Inland Revenue's receipts.
Other measures included a one-year extension of special tax breaks for small and medium-sized companies investing in new equipment and technology. And new credits for research and development will cost the Exchequer #100m in 2001/02.
As signalled a year ago, the main corporation tax rate will be reduced from 31% to 30% in the coming tax year. This is in line with the penny in the pound cut in the smaller companies rate.
Business organisations generally welcomed the measures. Lex Gold, director of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said: "This is a good Budget and will encourage enterprise." But he said increased taxes on petrol and diesel were unwelcome, highlighting the impact on business and rural communities in Scotland and claiming these so-called green measures were "nothing more than naked money-grabbing".

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/budget-reflect-values-scotland/docview/327399405/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: It's a Budget to make people in Scotland better off by up to GBP 2 billion. There's real help, for instance, for the 50,000 families with children in Edinburgh. A five-fold increase in help with winter fuel bills for the 85,000 pensioners in the city. It's a Budget to reward hard work through a new, lower, 10p rate of income tax which will mean extra money in your pay packet in just a few weeks time in May - and a cut next year in the basic rate as well. It will give lower and middle-income families with children an average GBP 220 a year extra. Families will also be helped by the Working Families Tax Credit introduced in October. It means guaranteed take-home pay of GBP 200 for any family with children with someone in full-time work - and a promise that no income tax at all will have to be paid until wages top GBP 235 a week.

Full text: I am delighted to have this chance to explain what my Budget will mean for Evening News readers, for Edinburgh, Scotland and the whole of Britain.
It's a Labour Budget. Rewarding work, supporting families, rebuilding our public services. Rooted in Scottish values of hard work, fairness and enterprise. Helping the poorest, but not at the expense of middle-income families.
A Budget that brings our country together rather than the Tory Budgets of the past which forced us apart.
It's a Budget to make people in Scotland better off by up to GBP 2 billion. There's real help, for instance, for the 50,000 families with children in Edinburgh. A five-fold increase in help with winter fuel bills for the 85,000 pensioners in the city.
It's a Budget to reward hard work through a new, lower, 10p rate of income tax which will mean extra money in your pay packet in just a few weeks time in May - and a cut next year in the basic rate as well.
And it's a Budget to continue building a platform for long-term prosperity, ending the cycle of boom and bust which led to interest rates at 15 per cent and a doubling of the national debt under the Tories.
The steps we have taken since coming to power have meant inflation is low. We've slashed the annual level of Government borrowing we inherited. And the result is mortgage rates are lower than they've been for 35 years.
The tough steps we took in our first two years in power enable us now to help families and pensioners - and spend more money on our schools and hospitals throughout Scotland.
Next month will see the extra GBP 2.1bn for education and health in Scotland come on stream.
But yesterday I was able to announce an extra GBP 2000 for books for every school in Scotland. Extra investment too for our NHS - for accident and emergency units.
For families with children there's extra help so every child can have the best possible start in life.
The biggest-ever increase in child benefit - worth GBP 150 a year more -will be paid to Scotland's 650,000 families next month.
Yesterday I announced child benefit will again be increased well above inflation next April, to GBP 15 for the first child. I also announced that, from April 2001, there will be a new children's tax credit worth up to GBP 416 as the married couples' allowance is phased out.
It will give lower and middle-income families with children an average GBP 220 a year extra. Families will also be helped by the Working Families Tax Credit introduced in October. It means guaranteed take-home pay of GBP 200 for any family with children with someone in full-time work - and a promise that no income tax at all will have to be paid until wages top GBP 235 a week.
On the edge of the 21st century, one in three Scottish children should not be growing up in poverty. Pensioners suffered badly under the last government. We have cut VAT on fuel, as promised, and given extra help with winter fuel bills. From next month, eye test charges will be abolished and a minimum guaranteed income introduced for pensioners.
Yesterday, I announced we could -and would - do more.
The winter payment is being increased for next winter from GBP 20 to GBP 100 - a real boost for Scotland's 900,000 pensioners. We are also extending the New Deal - which has already helped cut long-term youth unemployment in Scotland by 44 per cent since the election - to the unemployed over 50, giving them real help to find work.
We have already taken steps to make work pay. The national minimum wage next month will mean a pay rise for 182,000 people in Scotland - nearly one in ten of the workforce.
But yesterday I fulfilled my pre-election promise to bring in a 10p lower rate of income tax.
It will be introduced next month on the first GBP 1500 of taxable income. It will mean a tax cut for everyone.
But it will have the biggest impact on those who need it most. The new 10p rate will halve the income tax bill for 1.8 million of Britain's lowest paid people.
They will also be helped - along with all other employees - by our moves to raise the starting level for national insurance contributions.
And because of the tough decisions we have already made to get the economy back on track, I could make one other proposal to make work pay. I announced that from April next year, the basic rate of income tax will be cut to 22p. It will be the lowest basic rate of income tax for 70 years.
The money to fund these cuts has been found from closing tax loopholes - on VAT and Capital Gains Tax, for instance.
It is wrong that some people don't pay their fair share while hard-working families are struggling to make ends meet.
And we are also continuing the phasing out of mortgage tax relief, started by the Tories, and now worth just GBP 2.50 a week.
The impact of the Budget changes means that if you have two children and one of you is working and earning GBP 20,000, you will be GBP 460 a year better off. A couple with two kids and a joint income of GBP 35,000 will gain by GBP 505 a year.
But by encouraging enterprise and protecting our environment, we are also helping build a better future for our children.
So we are cutting corporation tax for smaller firms to 10p and giving tax breaks to encourage investment in research and development. It will create jobs here in Scotland while the SNP's policies would drive them away.
We are bringing in a climate change levy on industry to encourage firms to save energy and enable this country to play its part in combating global warming and protecting our planet in the new Millennium.
I also announced that duty on whisky, spirits and all other alcohol will not rise this side of the Millennium.
Managing the economy successfully is the biggest challenge any government can face. This Government is meeting that challenge. We had two tough years to sort out the public finances and tackle inflation. We can now begin to reap the benefits of the economic strength we are building.
It means more investment in health in Scotland. More investment in Scottish education. It means fair tax cuts to help working people secure higher living standards.
This is a Budget that reflects the values of the people of Scotland. Which meets the challenges of today and equips us for the challenges of tomorrow. It continues to fulfil Labour's promises.
This is a better deal for work and families, a better deal for Edinburgh, and a better deal for the people of Scotland and Britain.

Full text: A PLAN to tax companies on the amount of energy they use was the flagship environment policy announcement in a Budget which has been generally welcomed by green groups.
Gordon Brown said that last year's recommendations from Lord Marshall on an energy tax would be implemented as a way of encouraging fuel efficiency and reducing the country's contribution to the causes of global warming.
Other green measures include year-on-year increases in the landfill tax to encourage recycling and a warning for the quarrying industry to introduce new environmental measures before a tax on sand and gravel is introduced.
Announcing the energy tax, Mr Brown said: "Climate change is recognised as one of the most significant environmental threats facing the world. This tax reform will benefit the environment we live in, put UK industry at the forefront of developing new technologies, and help encourage employment opportunities."
The tax will be introduced in 2001 and is expected to save around 1.5 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010. It will apply to agriculture and the public sector as well as private industry.
Most significantly, Mr Brown announced the measure would be fiscally neutral because what he takes from industry in the new tax, he will repay by reducing the burden of national insurance employer contributions.
Lord Marshall said last night: "It sounds pretty good to me. We did look at it with some intensity and we tried to weigh up all the alternatives and options. Obviously, the extent to which they have accepted the recommendations in the report is most encouraging."
However, the Confederation of British Industry, which had braced itself for the new tax, said it was disappointed that Mr Brown had not scrapped the tax for those firms which agreed to emissions trading schemes or negotiated significant energy cuts.
Fiona Davis, the CBI's energy specialist, said: "We welcome the fact that the tax will be introduced on a revenue neutral basis. Clearly, the extent to which the tax rate will be lower for high energy users will be crucial in determining the competitiveness impact of the tax."
Dr Richard Dixon, head of research for Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: "We are very pleased Mr Brown has decided to implement the Marshall report and it is especially pleasing that he has moved the burden from taxing jobs through the NI contributions to taxing energy."
William Hague, the leader of the Opposition, protested that the tax would hit manufacturing industry hardest. He said it was the most capital intensive industry and most reliant on the use of fuels.
"The corresponding and compensating reduction in national insurance contributions, will give the least help to manufacturing industry because they are the least labour intensive," he said.
Mr Brown announced that the landfill tax, increased last year to GBP 10 per tonne will now rise by GBP 1 a tonne per year until at least 2005.
Peter Jones, director of external affairs at BIFFA Waste Services, one of the biggest waste firms in the UK, said: "I don't think this will have much impact at all, particularly in Scotland where there are relatively low landfill charges in the first place a I would have like to have seen a much higher escalator for this tax to really encourage more environmentally friendly ways of disposing of waste."
It was announced by the Treasury yesterday - not as part of the Chancellor's speech - that a tax on quarrying could be introduced.
Patricia Hewitt, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said: "Research shows that there are significant environmental costs to quarrying. This suggests that there is a case, in principle, for a tax on the extraction of aggregates."
Jerry McLaughlin, economist for the Quarry Products Association, said: "We are glad that they will be coming to us to negotiate on a voluntary code of practice first but we are disappointed the threat of legislation is there. This would not have any environmental benefit a it will simply mean customers and operators will be paying more for aggregates."
Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat Environment spokesman welcomed the budget for containing "significant green steps" but said more needed to be done.

Budget 1999: Energy Tax - Green lobby praises anti-pollution measures: [FINAL Edition]

Author: McCarthy, Michael

Abstract: A NEW energy tax for industry and a raft of measures to cut car pollution are significant steps towards meeting Britain's tough targets for cutting the greenhouse gases believed to be causing global warming. The Government considers the tax unavoidable if emissions of carbon dioxide from power stations are to be curbed in line with the Kyoto agreement on climate change of December 1997, and the even tougher Labour manifesto pledge to cut CO2 emissions by 20 per cent by 2010. Mr Brown gave no detail of levels for the tax, but promised that it would be revenue-neutral, and industry as a whole would be compensated for its additional bill with cuts in the level of employee national insurance contributions (NICs) from 12.2 to 11.7 per cent. Energy-intensive industries would be set "significantly lower" rates of tax if they improved their energy efficiency, he said, promising discussions with them.

Full text: A NEW energy tax for industry and a raft of measures to cut car pollution are significant steps towards meeting Britain's tough targets for cutting the greenhouse gases believed to be causing global warming.
They drew an effusively warm welcome from environmentalists, but the prospect of the new tax was greeted with apprehension by industry.
The tax was recommended in a report last November from Lord Marshall of Knightsbridge (formerly Sir Colin Marshall), the chairman of British Airways and past president of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), and will come into operation in two years' time.
The Government considers the tax unavoidable if emissions of carbon dioxide from power stations are to be curbed in line with the Kyoto agreement on climate change of December 1997, and the even tougher Labour manifesto pledge to cut CO2 emissions by 20 per cent by 2010.
Mr Brown gave no detail of levels for the tax, but promised that it would be revenue-neutral, and industry as a whole would be compensated for its additional bill with cuts in the level of employee national insurance contributions (NICs) from 12.2 to 11.7 per cent. Energy-intensive industries would be set "significantly lower" rates of tax if they improved their energy efficiency, he said, promising discussions with them.
But the big energy users, such as the steel, cement, aluminium and chemicals industries, reacted warily.
"I don't think energy- intensive industries can stand being taxed any more than they are without being driven out of business," said Lisa Waters, economic adviser to the Energy-Intensive Users' Group, which represents firms with huge electricity bills.
Energy represented up to 80 per cent of the costs of some sectors such as aluminium and chemicals, she said, and as they were capital- intensive rather than labour-intensive, the NICs cut would not fully compensate them. "It all depends on the exemptions," she said.
Fiona Davies, energy adviser to the CBI, said: "The extent of the level at which the exemptions are set will be crucial in terms of the effects of the tax on competitiveness."
However, the move delighted environmental groups. Ian Taylor, scientific political adviser to Greenpeace, said it provided "welcome recognition that the protection of the climate requires a long-term signal to industry to change its ways. That, as Lord Marshall recommended, means a tax."
Charles Secrett, executive director of Friends of the Earth, said that New Labour had taken its "first halting steps towards green economics".
The Institute for Public Policy Research, the left-leaning think- tank that has long supported an energy tax, was even more generous in its praise. "This is probably Britain's greenest-ever Budget, and it helps prove the Chancellor's commitment to the environment," said its environment researcher, Chris Hewett.
The Government is confident of meeting the first of its two climate-change targets, the one in the Kyoto treaty. This obliges it to make a cutback in a "basket" of CO2 and five other industrial gases to 12.5 per cent below their 1990 levels by 2010. That target is 189 million tons (in "carbon equivalent") On present policies Britain will be emitting 194 million tons in 10 years' time, but ministers feel energy-saving measures in the pipeline will enable the target to be met.
However, the Labour manifesto target, subsequently confirmed, of a 20 per cent cutback from 1990 levels in CO2 alone, is a much tougher proposition. That target is 135 million tons, and on present policies Britain will be emitting 163 million tons of the gas in 2010. The gap will take some bridging.
Mr Brown said yesterday that the energy tax was calculated to take out 1.5 million tons of CO2 annually, and the anti-car pollution measures he announced would account for another 1.5 million tons.
There is a long way to go, and scientific concern continues to grow over climate change. Last year was the hottest year in the modern climatic record and British scientists who have reconstructed the climate of the past from tree-ring data said it was the warmest for 1,000 years. The five hottest years have all been in the Nineties.

Abstract: The price of a gallon of unleaded petrol will top pounds 3 for the first time after the Chancellor announced a 6 per cent rise in fuel duty. From 6pm yesterday, duty on unleaded fuel rose by 3.79p a litre. This means a rise in a litre of fuel of 3.79p to around 67p and to pounds 3.13 from pounds 2.91 for a gallon. Leaded fuel duty rose by 4.25p per litre to 74.4p. Diesel rose by 6.14p per litre to nearly 71p. The Chancellor announced a reform of the Vehicle Excise Duty (road tax) on cars based on the level of pollution emissions. VED for all private and light goods vehicles will be increased by pounds 5 to pounds 155 from today. But from 1 June smaller cars with engines up to 1,100cc would pay a rate of pounds 100. From autumn 2000, the rate for new cars will be determined primarily by their carbon dioxide emission rate.

Full text: MOTORISTS were given a clear warning to get out of their vehicles and use public transport, or buy a smaller car, as the Government imposed hefty rises.
The price of a gallon of unleaded petrol will top pounds 3 for the first time after the Chancellor announced a 6 per cent rise in fuel duty.
He also unveiled a package of measures to reward the use of "greener" cars, initiatives to encourage workers to share vehicles or to come to work by bicycle, and a crackdown on company car tax-breaks for 1.5 million drivers.
Motoring organisations warned the measures would hit rural drivers and the elderly and accused ministers of raising a green "smokescreen". But environmental groups gave the Budget a cautious welcome.
From 6pm yesterday, duty on unleaded fuel rose by 3.79p a litre. This means a rise in a litre of fuel of 3.79p to around 67p and to pounds 3.13 from pounds 2.91 for a gallon. Leaded fuel duty rose by 4.25p per litre to 74.4p. Diesel rose by 6.14p per litre to nearly 71p.
The 6 per cent rise implements the Government's commitment to "escalate" fuel duty as part of its climate change strategy.
The Chancellor announced a reform of the Vehicle Excise Duty (road tax) on cars based on the level of pollution emissions. VED for all private and light goods vehicles will be increased by pounds 5 to pounds 155 from today. But from 1 June smaller cars with engines up to 1,100cc would pay a rate of pounds 100. From autumn 2000, the rate for new cars will be determined primarily by their carbon dioxide emission rate.
The RAC said that an average motorist driving 10,000 miles a year using unleaded fuel in a hatchback car would be pounds 60 worse off. Edmund King, head of campaigns, said: "Many motorists, such as the elderly, disabled and rural residents are totally dependent on the car."
He said the two-tier VED system was a "tax on luxury not use" as it did not punish drivers of larger cars for heavy mileage. "The Treasury is dressing up tax rises in greenery."
The AA said the rises in fuel duty meant motorists were paying a record pounds 8.50 to the Chancellor for every pounds 10 spent on the garage forecourt. John Dawson, head of policy, said: "The Chancellor's environmental excuses for hitting drivers again with the fuel escalator are wearing extremely thin."
Mr Brown announced a reform of tax on company cars to encourage the use of fuel efficient cars. The current system that cuts the tax by a third for people who do more than 2,500 business miles and by half for more than 18,000 will be abolished in 2002. It will be replaced with incentives to encourage the purchase of cars with lower CO2 emission. Mr Brown said the reform would cost the typical user about pounds 1 a week.
The Chancellor was applauded by environmental groups for removing tax penalties on employers who offer green benefits such as works buses, discount fares and allowances for using cycles.
Tony Bosworth, of Friends of the Earth, said: "This Budget represents the Government's first halting steps towards green economies."
Transport 2000 director Stephen Joseph said: "We're now seeing the tax system starting to swing behind integrated transport and away from rewarding gas guzzlers and business car travel."
The Chancellor said there would be more money for public transport. However, the Government said the details would not be published until John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, returned from India.
The changes are unlikely to meet Mr Prescott's target of cutting the number of car journeys. One think-tank, the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said road usage would be cut by just 0.51 per cent.
Mr Brown offered some good news for the freight industry. VED will be frozen for 98 per cent of all lorries and cut by up to pounds 1,000 for lorries and buses with clean engines.
The Freight Transport Association welcomed the move but condemned the 6.14p rise in duty on diesel, which it said effectively doubled the world price of bulk diesel. "The Chancellor's crude strategy of bleeding the transport industry to pay for Government expenditure should be about helping industry - not stealing from it," it said.
Drivers will also have to pay extra for motor insurance as Insurance Premium Tax rises by 1 per cent to 5 per cent from 1 July, adding pounds 6 to an average household insurance bill of pounds 667.
The Opposition seized on the rises in fuel duty. William Hague, the Tory leader, said: "The Government have taken their persecution of the motorist too far and their damage to the haulage industry too far."

Full text: The government's central economic objective is to achieve high and stable levels of growth and employment. This Budget will help build a stronger economic future for Britain through reforms that will put work, enterprise and families first. By protecting the environment and ensuring that growth is sustainable, this Budget will also ensure a better quality of life today and for future generations.
The key elements of the government's strategy are:
* locking in economic stability as a platform for long-term growth;
* raising productivity through promoting enterprise and investment;
* increasing employment opportunity with a better deal for working families;
* and building a fairer society, with a better deal for families and children.
The pre-Budget report, published in November, set out the direction of government policy and measures under consideration to deliver this strategy. A series of regional roadshows has subsequently widened the debate on how to rise to the productivity challenge and secure high and stable growth and employment.
Macroeconomic strategy and prospects
In the past, Britain has suffered greater volatility in output and inflation than most other major industrial countries. Such volatility imposed both social and economic costs. On coming into office, the government therefore introduced a new framework for monetary and fiscal policy to promote economic stability, while ensuring that macroeconomic policy responds sensibly to economic shocks. This included:
* a new monetary framework to deliver low and stable inflation: the Bank of England's monetary policy committee has been given operational independence to set interest rates to deliver the government's inflation target;
* a new fiscal framework, including two strict fiscal rules - the golden rule and the sustainable investment rule - to get the public finances under control. Borrowing has been reduced by a cumulative £29bn over the last two years and tight control has been maintained over public expenditure;
* and a new public expenditure regime which, together with new three year spending plans, will provide greater certainty and encourage longer-term planning.
The rewards of the new framework are already evident. Inflation is close to target. Interest rates peaked at 7{1/2} per cent last year, half their peak level in the last cycle. Debt interest payments are falling. And employment is up by more than 400,000 since May 1997; long-term and youth unemployment have fallen by 50 per cent.
The Budget 99 forecast confirms that:
* RPIX inflation is forecast to remain at the target level of 2{1/2} per cent;
* and growth will be lower this year than last, following the global slowdown.
However, the economy is well placed for stronger growth into 2000, in line with independent forecasters. This means that this cycle is set to be much more moderate than those in recent decades.
Budget 99 locks in the economic stability that the new framework has delivered. As a result of the strengthening underlying fiscal position, the fiscal rules are still met while the new Budget measures provide an extra £6bn support over the next three years to boost the economy during the period when output is below its trend level. The public finances forecast shows that:
* the surplus on current budget is projected to average 0-4 per cent of GDP over the current economic cycle;
* and net public debt is projected to decline significantly as a proportion of GDP, to below 35 per cent by 2003-04.
Meeting these rules will allow the UK to:
* maintain high quality public services and deliver the spending commitments - including £40bn additional investment in education and health over the next three years - announced in the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR);
* and ensure the overall position of the public finances remains sound. As both rules are set over the economic cycle, they will also allow the automatic stabilisers to play their part so that fiscal policy continues to support monetary policy in the next phase of the cycle.
In addition, illustrative baseline projections for the next 30 years indicate a sustainable fiscal position, capable of delivering equitable outcomes for future generations.
The government is taking further steps to raise the sustainable rate of growth by tackling the underlying structural weaknesses in the economy.
Impact on households
Budget 99 will support families with children and reward work. Taken together with the measures announced in Budget 98, it will:
* make people better off - over 20m households gain, of which 7m are households with children and 7m are pensioner households; on average, households will be £380 a year better off.
* support families - families with children will on average be £740 a year better off; poorer families will also benefit; 700,000 children will be taken out of poverty.
* reward work - working households will on average be £450 a year better off; the new 10p rate of tax will halve the tax bill for 1.8m, of whom 1.5m are low-paid employees; the Working Families Tax Credit will on average give low earning families an extra £24 a week, compared with Family Credit.
Building a fairer society
Economic growth, opportunity and fairness go hand in hand: an economy in which a significant proportion of the population is unable to fulfil its potential will be poorer and less productive.
It also ensures that growth takes place in a way that is fair to today's and future generations. The government will publish later this year its Sustainable Development Strategy: achieving economic growth while protecting and where possible enhancing the environment and making sure that the benefits are available to everyone, not just the few.
The government is therefore committed to:
* ensuring that everyone has access to high quality public services, including decent schools and a modern health service;
* ensuring that all families with children are supported through the tax and benefit system;
* targeted support focusing on: work as the best way out of poverty; families and children to ensure that every child can thrive and take advantage of new opportunities; help for those not in work, including giving a better deal to pensioners; and ensuring that growth is sustainable, respects the environment and is fair to future generations.
The CSR focused on how public services could be modernised to meet these goals. For example:
* an extra £40bn will be invested in modernising health and education over the next three years;
* child benefit will increase by £2.95 a week for the eldest child from April;
* and new targeted initiatives such as the Sure Start programme were set up to ensure that all children are ready to learn when they reach school.
Budget 1999 focuses principally on tax and other measures that will increase opportunity and protect the environment including: a better deal for families and children; the introduction of a Children's Tax Credit, replacing the married couples allowance and related allowances, and which will be worth £416 a year, with increases in the Working Families' Tax Credit (WFTC) and Income Support to ensure all children benefit; and a 3 per cent real increase in Child Benefit to at least £15 and £10 a week from April 2000 for first and subsequent children respectively.
Modernising public services will include a £1.1bn package of investment from the Capital Modernisation Fund which will provide: £470m to support a national IT strategy; £430m to modernise Accident and Emergency services and improve access to primary care services; and £170m to tackle crime.
Pensioners will get a £1bn package, including a £100 winter allowance, a minimum guarantee on tax and an increased Minimum Income Guarantee.
For charities there will be a Review of Charity Taxation consultation document which will explore how the tax system can encourage more giving to charity.
To tackle tax abuse, measures will be designed to ensure individuals and businesses pay their fair share of taxes.
To protect the environment, there will be a package of measures aimed at: encouraging energy efficiency and tackling climate change through a new climate change levy; improving local air quality and supporting the integrated transport strategy through a major reform of the company car tax regime, a reduction to £100 in vehicle excise duty rates for cars with the smallest engines, tax measures to promote environmentally friendly commuting and increases in road fuel duties; and encouraging sustainable waste management through increases in the rate of the landfill tax.
Raising productivity
The UK produces less per person than other major economies. The productivity gap of 40 per cent with the US and over 20 per cent with France and Germany reflects long-standing weaknesses in the economy:
* the UK has invested less in research and development (R&D): the US invests 50 per cent more, as a share of GDP, in business enterprise R&D;
* for every £100 per worker invested in new capital equipment in the UK during the last economic cycle, the US and Germany invested £140;
* and fewer people have basic skill levels: 22 per cent of adults in the UK have poor literacy skills, 50 per cent more than in Germany.
The government has already introduced - in the 1997 and 1998 Budgets and CSR - a number of microeconomic reforms targeted on the five key drivers of productivity growth:
* investment: corporation tax has been reduced to its lowest ever level and tax measures introduced to encourage investment for the long-term;
* innovation and enterprise: £1.4bn additional investment in science will promote high quality research and innovation;
* education and skills: an extra £19bn will be invested over the next three years in raising achievement and improving skill levels;
* competition: new competition laws will increase efficiency and deliver a better deal for consumers;
* and public sector efficiency: setting challenging performance targets.
Budget 99 builds on this start through a further package of measures including:
* a new 10p corporation tax rate for small companies and extension of 40 per cent capital allowances for small and medium enterprises (SME) to encourage entrepreneurial activity and innovative investment;
* a new £20m venture capital challenge to finance early stage high-technology businesses;
* a new research and development tax credit in 2000 to encourage small businesses investment in R&D;
* an additional £100m for basic science infrastructure to help provide a modern research base;
* a new Employee Share Ownership scheme in 2000 to encourage employees to take a stake in the success of their companies;
* a new Small Business Service to deliver services to small firms, including a new Automatic Payroll Service;
* from 2000, setting an 80 per cent discount for key courses such as computer literacy, funded through Individual Learning Accounts.
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will be making further announcements after the Budget, taking forward the competitiveness agenda.
Increasing jobs opportunity
The strategy takes account of major changes in the labour market over the last two or three decades, including:
* growing structural unemployment and rising inactivity amongst certain groups;
* an increase in the number of women in work and part-time jobs; and
* a tax and benefit system which has trapped many families into poverty and unemployment.
Major reforms were introduced in the 1997 and 1998 Budgets and the CSR to take forward the government's employment strategy based on helping people from welfare to work, and making work pay. For example:
* the Welfare to Work initiative, funded through a £5.2bn windfall tax on the excess profits of the privatised utilities, has already benefited over 350,000 people through the New Deal;
* tax and benefit reforms: the WFTC will be introduced in October 1999 providing extra help for 1.4m working families;
* a national minimum wage will be introduced in April 1999;
* national insurance contributions (NICs) reform: removing the burdens on the low paid;
* and a New Deal for Communities and Employment Zones will tackle persistent high unemployment.
Budget 99 will build on these measures by delivering welfare to work;
* providing extra help for young people on the New Deal to ensure there is no option of simply staying on benefit;
* providing personalised support to help people over 50 move back to work;
* and an Income Support run-on to ease the transition into work for lone parents.
From October 1999 there will be a minimum income guarantee of £200 per week for full-time working families; no family will pay net income tax until they earn more than £235 (over £12,000 a year); the NICs bill will be eliminated for about 900,000 people earning too little even to pay income tax; there will be a cut in the NICs bill for low earning self-employed people from April 2000; there will be a new 10p rate of income tax from April 1999 which halves the tax bill for 1.8m taxpayers; and there will a cut in the basic rate of income tax to 22p from April 2000 to reward work and ensure working families are better off.

Abstract: The married couple's allowance, for a husband and wife aged under 65, and related allowances, will be removed from 6 April 2000. Couples in which at least one of the spouses was born before 6 April 1935 will remain entitled to claim the married couple's allowance.

Mortgage interest relief for those aged 65 and over who take out a loan to buy a life annuity (a home income plan) ends with effect from 9 March 1999, but existing loans will continue to qualify for relief for the remainder of the loan period. Working Families Tax Credit: From 6 April 2000, there will be a further increase of £1.10 above indexation in the credit for children under 11 years. Disabled Person's Tax Credit: A new "fast-track" to the Disabled Person's Tax Credit will be introduced from October 2000 to help with the retention of staff disabled while working, and whose return to work depends on a reduction in hours or rate of pay. Income tax 2001-2002 Children's Tax Credit:Atax credit of up to £8 per week (£4,160 per year at 10 per cent) will be introduced from 6 April 2001 for families with children. The credit will be tapered away from families where one or both partners is a higher rate taxpayer. Inheritance tax: The threshold will be increased by statutory indexation to £231,000.

Full text: Income tax 1999-2000: A new rate of tax at 10 per cent will be introduced on the first £1,500 of income from 6 April 1999. The existing 20 per cent band on non-savings income will disappear.
Income tax on savings eligible for the lower rate up to the basic rate limit will continue at 20 per cent up to that limit and 40 per cent above it, except for dividends which from 6 April 1999 will be taxed at 10 per cent up to the basic rate limit and 32.5 per cent above it.
The personal allowance will increase to £4,335 as already announced. The blind person's allowance and the basic rate limit will rise in line with statutory indexation.
The married couple's allowance and related allowances will rise in line with indexation to £1,970 at 10 per cent in 1999-2000. The age-related married couple's allowance will also rise in line with indexation. (These allowances had already been increased for 1999-2000 on account of the change in the rate of relief to 10 per cent.)
Personal allowances for older people will be increased by up to £200 more than statutory indexation - to £5,720 and £5,980 respectively for people aged 65-74 years and 75 years and over. The income limit for the age-related allowances will be increased in line with statutory indexation to £16,800. Working Families Tax Credit: The basic tax credit in the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) will be increased by £2.50 and the tax credit for children under 11 years will be increased by £4.70 from October 1999. Other measures: The maximum earnings for which pension provision may be made with income tax relief (the "earnings cap") will be increased in line with statutory indexation to £90,600.
The Government will confirm that annuities paid by free standing voluntary contributions schemes are taxable in full on receipt.
Investors in court common investment funds will be treated in the same way as investors in shares, authorised unit trusts or open-ended investment companies.
There will be no tax charge where an employer provides an employee with a mobile telephone which is used for private calls.
To make the repayment arrangements for the new income-contingent student loans fairer to borrowers, interest on amounts they have overpaid will be tax-free. Income tax 2000-2001: From 6 April 2000, the basic rate of income tax will be reduced from 23p to 22p.
The married couple's allowance, for a husband and wife aged under 65, and related allowances, will be removed from 6 April 2000. Couples in which at least one of the spouses was born before 6 April 1935 will remain entitled to claim the married couple's allowance. Tax relief for maintenance payments will cease for payments made and falling due on or after 6 April 2000. Tax relief for maintenance payments will be retained where one or more of the parties is aged 65 or over on 5 April 2000. Mortgage interest relief: Relief on mortgage interest repayments will be removed from 6 April 2000. Mortgage interest relief for those aged 65 and over who take out a loan to buy a life annuity (a home income plan) ends with effect from 9 March 1999, but existing loans will continue to qualify for relief for the remainder of the loan period. Working Families Tax Credit: From 6 April 2000, there will be a further increase of £1.10 above indexation in the credit for children under 11 years. Disabled Person's Tax Credit: A new "fast-track" to the Disabled Person's Tax Credit will be introduced from October 2000 to help with the retention of staff disabled while working, and whose return to work depends on a reduction in hours or rate of pay. Income tax 2001-2002 Children's Tax Credit:Atax credit of up to £8 per week (£4,160 per year at 10 per cent) will be introduced from 6 April 2001 for families with children. The credit will be tapered away from families where one or both partners is a higher rate taxpayer. Inheritance tax: The threshold will be increased by statutory indexation to £231,000.
A simpler procedure for obtaining information and stricter penalties for non-compliance will be introduced. Taxes on capital gains: The annual exempt amount will be increased by statutory indexation to £7,100.
Capital gains tax rates will be aligned with those for savings income, charging gains at 20 per cent or 40 per cent depending on the level of income and gains.
Rules for individuals in the Lloyd's insurance market will be changed in order to make the calculation of gains simpler and fairer. From 6 April 1999, an individual in a members' agent pooling arrangement (MAPA), will treat his or her share of the syndicates held through the MAPA as if it were a single direct holding. In addition, tax roll-over relief will be extended to include members' interests in syndicates, whether held directly or through a MAPA. Stamp duty: From 16 March 1999, stamp duty rates will be increased on transfers of land and property over £250,000 and less than £500,000 from 2.0 per cent to 2.5 per cent and from 3.0 per cent to 3.5 per cent for land and property over £500,000. Compliance and administration: Interest will be added to repayments of stamp duty and charged on duty paid late, as is the case for other taxes. Penalties will be increased to modern levels and the fixed duties will be raised to £5. Stamp duty will be charged in multiples of £5. These measures will take effect from 1 October 1999.
The government will clarify the statutory provisions which enable the treasury to make regulations for the administration of stamp duty reserve tax.
As announced on 29 January 1999, a loophole will be closed by restricting relief for foreign currency bearer instruments to its intended purpose, which is to assist companies borrowing money in other countries.
Measures will be introduced to clarify the stamp duty rules for foreign currency bearer shares and redenomination of the currency of shares in a depositary receipt scheme or clearance service. A relief will also be provided to allow depositary interests in foreign shares to be traded in the UK. Unit trust and oeics: The Government will introduce a clearer and easier framework for stamp duty reserve tax to replace the existing stamp duty regime for unit trusts and open-ended investment companies (oeics) from October 1999. National insurance: Employers' Class 1B liability will be deductible for tax in 1999-2000.
From April 2000, the threshold of earnings above which people will pay NICs will increase to £76 per week. A zero rate of NICs will apply on earnings between the previous lower limit and the new threshold to protect benefit entitlement. The threshold of earnings above which employees wil pay no NICS (the upper earnings limit, UEL) will increase to £535 per week.
From April 2000, employer NICs will be extended to those benefits in kind which as already subject to income tax.
From April 2000, the Class 2 NICs charge (which from April 1999 will; be payable when profits reach £72.50 per week) will be reduced from £5.55 to £2 a week. It is assumed that the starting point for Class 2 NICs will be indexed to £73.50 from April 2000. At the same time, the starting point for Class 4 NICs will be aligned with the income tax personal allowance at £85 per week and the contribution rate increased to 7 per cent. The upper profits limit rises with the UEL.
From April 2001, the threshold of earnings below which people will not pay NICs will increase to £87 per week, aligning it with the income tax personal allowance. The UEL will increase to £575 per week.
The rate of NICs paid by employers will be reduced by 0.5 percentage points in April 2001, offsetting the cost to business of the climate change levy.
The upper self-employed profits limit will increase to £575 per week, in line with the UEL. Benefits 1999-2000: Maternity Allowance will be extended to all women earning less than the lower earnings limit for NICs but at least £30 per week, to be paid at 90 per cent of previous earnings.
Premium for children under 11 years in Income Support will be increased by £4.70 from October 1999.
From October 1999, lone parents who have been claiming Income Support for at least six months and move into work and are claiming WFTC will be able to claim a "run-on" in their Income Support at the existing level for two weeks.
Workers aged over 50, who have been out of work and claiming benefits (Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support, Incapacity Benefit or Severe Disablement Allowance) for more than six months (or if their partner has been claiming a dependant's allowance in one of these benefits for them for six months, and neither partner is working), will be eligible for an in-work top-up payment of £60 per week, for 52 weeks, if they move into work for more than 30 hours a week. £40 will be available to those moving into part-time work, of between 16 and 30 hours per week.
A New Deal for the over-50s will provide personalised advice and support, complementing the Employment Credit. The over-50s will be eligible for in-work training grants of up to £750 to help them acquire accredited training. Pathfinders will start in October 1999, with a national roll-out in 2000.
The Government intends to announce pilots during 1999 to make the initial gateway at the beginning of the New Deal for 18-24 year olds more intensive. The gateway will also be made more intensive for people remaining in the gateway for more than three months.
From 1999-2000, the Winter Allowance to every pensioner household will be increased to £100 from its current level of £20. Benefits 2000-2001: Self-employed women will become entitled to the full rate of Maternity Allowance from April 2000.
From April 2000, the Social Fund maternity payment will be renamed the Sure Start Maternity Grant. The payment for each child will be doubled to £200 and will be paid following contact with a health professional or local Sure Start programme.
Child Benefit will be increased by around 3 per cent in real terms from April 2000, to be worth £15 for the first child and £10 for subsequent children per week.
Premium for children under 11 years in Income Support will be increased by a further £1.05 over and above indexation in April 2000.
In April 2000, the minimum income guarantee for pensioners will be uprated by earnings rather than prices.
BUSINESS TAXES AND SPENDING
Tax on business profits: A new 10 per cent rate of corporation tax will be introduced from 1 April 2000, for profits up to £10,000, also benefiting companies with profits up to £50,000.
The government will introduce new tax credits for spending by small and medium-sized companies on research and development. The new plans will be introduced in 2000 and the Inland Revenue is publishing a technical note on 10 March 1999.
First year allowances for small and medium-sized businesses introduced in 1997 will be extended for one year until 1 July 2000 at a rate of 40 per cent.
A measure will be introduced to help football clubs adjust to new accounting rules on intangible assets. These rules affect the way in which the cost of players is deducted from profits. The measure will prevent the need for early payments of tax, relating to existing players, which would otherwise have arisen in the transition to the new accounting rules.
Tax relief for donations of equipment or trading stock by businesses is being extended to cover all charitable causes. Value added tax: The VAT registration threshold will be increased broadly in line with inflation to £51,000 from 1 April 1999. The deregistration threshold will increase from £48,000 to £49,000. Customs and Excise will be working further with business to explore whether it is possible to cushion the impact of VAT registration on growing businesses.
Following consultation during 1998, the requirement for 90 days' notice for applications for group treatment will be removed. Customs and Excise will be able to remove any members from existing VAT groups, mirroring powers to refuse applications. Circumstances in which Customs and Excise will normally invoke their revenue protection powers will be clarified in a business brief. Criteria for including foreign companies in VAT groupings will be redefined.
The rule allowing certain VAT-exempt business activities to be ignored and all input tax to be reclaimed will be withdrawn with effect from 10 March 1999.
From 10 March 1999, the scope of the VAT exemption relating to financial intermediary services, payment and credit transfer services and credit management services will be clarified to restore the position that existed before recent legal challenges.
Legislation will be introduced to make investment gold exempt from VAT from 1 January 2000. It will implement EC Directive 98/80/EC. Industrial gold and jewellery will remain liable to VAT.
The government will introduce a power to impose a penalty on customers providing incorrect certificates to claim eligibility for reduced rate fuel and power.
The government will clarify legislation providing a two year time limit for Customs and Excise to penalise VAT-registered businesses not complying with requirements to submit details of sales to VAT-registered businesses in other EU member states.
Membership subscriptions to organisations with political, religious, patriotic, philosophical or philanthropic aims will become exempt from VAT.
Interest payments will be charged at a commercial rate on late payment of Customs duty debts. Traders will be able to claim interest payments for late repayments of a valid duty claim.
Drawback legislation will be further standardised to prevent potential loss of revenue through drawback on non-commercial exports of oil. Tax avoidance and evasion by business: The government will extend anti-avoidance legislation which counteracts the artificial techniques that strip value out of subsidiaries prior to sale to avoid tax liabilities.
Loopholes in the rules for North Sea corporation tax and petroleum revenue tax which could be exploited by the sale and leaseback of North Sea assets will be closed.
New rules will prevent companies avoiding tax by channelling UK dividends via controlled foreign companies.
Legislation will be introduced to allow taxpayers and the Inland Revenue to agree in advance how the arm's length principle is to be applied in relation to specific cross-border (or cross-
North Sea "ring-fence") transactions .
Following a recent adverse decision by the Privy Council, legislation will be introduced to tax sums paid by landlords to induce tenants to take out a lease, sometimes called reverse premiums.
Following consultation, an existing anti-avoidance measure on construction services will be replaced with a new anti-avoidance measure better targeted on abuse.
Anti-avoidance provisions that prevent businesses artificially inflating their recovery of VAT on the construction of non-residential buildings by lease and leaseback will be extended from 10 March 1999.
Loopholes that could allow VAT to be avoided or too much bad debt relief to be claimed when debts are assigned to other parties will be closed from 10 March 1999.
A loophole that could allow businesses to qualify for repayment supplement by lodging their VAT return early will be closed from 9 March 1999.
A loophole that might allow the capital goods scheme to be exploited for tax avoidance will be closed from 10 March 1999. Incentives for investors and entrepreneurs: The government will introduce a new Venture Capital Challenge of £20m from the Capital Modernisation Fund (CMF). This will be invested in new funds for early stage high-technology businesses in partnership with project investors. The funds will operate throughout the UK and will have a strong regional dimension.
The government proposes to introduce a tax incentive in Budget 2000 to promote corporate venturing. The Inland Revenue will issue a technical note on 10 March 1999 setting out the proposal in more detail.
The government will take steps to prevent the incidence of capital gains tax acting as a barrier to investors in the Enterprise Investment Scheme who want to dispose of their investments and reinvest the gains in other EIS companies. Such investors deferring a chargeable gain from an EIS investment by reinvesting it in another EIS company will benefit from the capital gains tax taper on a cumulative basis, calculating taper relief for the deferred gain by reference to the combined ownership period. Incentives for employees and managers: The government will introduce a new all-employee share scheme in Budget 2000, to allow employees to buy shares from their pre-tax salary and to receive free shares, with further tax incentives for longer term shareholding. Any gains arising on shares held for three years in the scheme will be tax-free. There will be greater flexibility in the ways in which employers can give shares as well as tax benefits and payroll services. The details are set out in a technical paper issued by the Inland Revenue on 9 March 1999. An advisory group drawn from practitioners, business and other experts will help the Inland Revenue design the details of the new scheme and consider what measures could be specifically introduced to make employee share ownership more attractive to smaller compa nies. Draft legislation will be published as part of the Pre-Budget Report and the changes will be introduced in Budget 2000.
The government will introduce a new Enterprise Management Incentives scheme in Budget 2000, limited to small higher risk trading companies. The Inland Revenue will issue a technical note on 10 March 1999 setting out the proposed scheme in more detail. The advisory group for the all-employee share scheme will also be closely involved in its design. Education and training: The government will introduce Individual Learning Accounts (ILAs). The first "starter" accounts will open in 1999-2000. For each of these accounts, the government will provide £150 for spending on education and training, when the holder commits £25.
From 2000, ILAs will offer their holders: discounts of 80 per cent of the cost of certain key courses such as computer literacy; discounts for everyone of 20 per cent on eligible courses, on spending of up to £500 per year; tax relief to employers on contributions to employees' ILAs; and tax relief to employees on their employers' contributions providing that the employer is contributing to the ILAs of their lowest paid employees on similar terms. This will be supplemented by spending within the Department for Education and Employment's Departmental Expenditure Limit on discounts for ILA holders.
Higher rate tax relief on vocational training will be abolished from 6 April 1999, and the remaining relief will be abolished in 2000-2001. Administrative help for small businesses: The government will create a Small Business Service (SBS) to co-ordinate advice and support to small and medium-sized businesses across England. It will have a new role to help business comply with regulations and to improve the quality and coherence of delivery of government support programmes. It will also run the Department of Trade and Industry's Enterprise Fund and the new Venture Capital Challenge for high technology. It will also offer a new automated payroll service for small employers.
In addition to the new automated payroll service offered by the SBS, the government will establish new national standards for computer payroll software.
The limit for Pay As You Earn (PAYE) quarterly payments by employers will be increased to £1,000, allowing more small employers to pay PAYE quarterly rather than monthly.
The Inland Revenue will introduce new business support teams working closely with the SBS to help small businesses and new employers. The service will include the offer of a half-day's one-to-one advice. There will also be a new helpline service for new employers and a range of improved guidance material.
Customs and Excise will conduct a national survey during 1999 to obtain information about current business views to inform service improvements. Support available for newly VAT-registered businesses will be expanded to include a business support programme for new exporters and importers. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

Levy raises concerns over competitiveness ENERGY: [London edition]

Author: Houlder, Vanessa; Taylor, Andrew

Abstract: The government yesterday announced an energy tax on business, as part of "the largest and most radical package of environmental tax reforms ever announced in this country". The tax is expected to raise at least £1.75bn in its first full year, from April 2001. This will be fully offset through cuts in employers' national insurance contributions from 12.2 per cent to 11.7 per cent. The levy will be paid by energy suppliers who will pass it on to industrial and commercial customers. The government is to consult with industry on the details of the charges. The Treasury said the climate change levy would play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent - its legally binding target under international agreements - and promoting energy efficiency. The energy tax is expected to cut carbon pollution by 1.5m tonnes, as part of a programme of Budget measures totalling cuts of 3m tonnes.

Full text: The government yesterday announced an energy tax on business, as part of "the largest and most radical package of environmental tax reforms ever announced in this country".
Industry reaction varied from disappointment at the imposition of an energy tax to relief the overall impact would be revenue neutral.
The tax is expected to raise at least £1.75bn in its first full year, from April 2001. This will be fully offset through cuts in employers' national insurance contributions from 12.2 per cent to 11.7 per cent. The levy will be paid by energy suppliers who will pass it on to industrial and commercial customers. The government is to consult with industry on the details of the charges.
The chancellor said that government was implementing the recommendations made by Lord Marshall, the chairman of British Airways, who led a government task-force on the business use of energy last year.
The Treasury said the climate change levy would play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent - its legally binding target under international agreements - and promoting energy efficiency. The energy tax is expected to cut carbon pollution by 1.5m tonnes, as part of a programme of Budget measures totalling cuts of 3m tonnes.
Mr Brown promised "significantly" lower rates of tax for energy-intensive sectors that improve their energy efficiency. Energy intensive sectors are being asked to come forward with proposals, which may include trading in carbon "permits", a system put forward in Lord Marshall's report.
The Confederation of British Industry said it welcomed the revenue neutral basis of the energy tax and the possible lower rate for heavy users. But it would have preferred full tax exemption for energy-intensive companies if they participated in negotiated agreements or emissions trading schemes.
The Energy Intensive Users Group expressed concern that big electricity users such as steel, cement and glass manufacturers were capital rather than labour intensive and would receive little comparative benefit from reduced national insurance contributions.
It said prices paid for power by energy intensive industries were already 40 per cent lower in some continental European countries.
"The UK has some of the most energy efficient industries in the world. In some cases further emissions reductions will only be achieved by reduced output and lost jobs," said the group.
The Utility Buyers' Forum representing a cross section of industrial and commercial customers expressed concern that companies might be dissuaded from using renewable energy if it meant their consumption would be taxed anyway.
The Chemicals Industries Association expressed its "deep disappointment" about the tax, which it said would disadvantage chemical companies against their competitors in other countries.
Environmental groups mostly gave the chancellor's announcement a warm welcome, despite voicing certain reservations. Friends of the Earth described the government's steps towards green economics as "tentative but exciting progress". Greenpeace said it "applauded" the chancellor's announcement on energy tax.
Patricia Hewitt, economic secretary, said the Budget represented a step change in the government's efforts to use the tax system to deliver environmental objectives. As well as tackling climate change, the Budget package aimed to improve local air quality and support integrated transport and limit the environmental impact of land use and water pollution.
The government announced an extra £50m to encourage business to invest in the new environmental technologies and in renewable fuels.
It also announced plans to increase the rate of landfill tax "to send a strong signal to waste producers and to allow waste managers and local authorities to consider alternatives to landfill". The tax, which will rise to £10 a tonne this April, will increase by £1 per tonne a year from April 2000 to 2004, when it will be subject to further review.
The government also said it believed that "there is a case, in principle" for an aggregates tax to reduce the environmental impact of quarrying. But before deciding whether to introduce a tax it will explore with the quarrying industry the scope for an enhanced package of voluntary measures. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

Abstract: A levy on the business use of energy, with offsetting cuts in employers' national insurance contributions and additional support for energy efficiency schemes and renewable sources of energy, will be introduced from April 2001. This reform follows closely the recommendations made in Lord Marshall's report on the role of economic instruments and the business use of energy, published last November. The climate-change levy will play a major role in helping meet the UK's targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It will entail no increase in the tax burden on business as the revenues will be recycled in full to business. These reforms will promote energy efficiency, encourage employment opportunities, and stimulate investment in new technologies.

Full text: A levy on the business use of energy, with offsetting cuts in employers' national insurance contributions and additional support for energy efficiency schemes and renewable sources of energy, will be introduced from April 2001.
This reform follows closely the recommendations made in Lord Marshall's report on the role of economic instruments and the business use of energy, published last November. The climate-change levy will play a major role in helping meet the UK's targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
It will entail no increase in the tax burden on business as the revenues will be recycled in full to business. These reforms will promote energy efficiency, encourage employment opportunities, and stimulate investment in new technologies.
Announcing the reforms, Gordon Brown said: "Climate change is recognised as one of the most significant environmental threats facing the world. This tax reform will benefit the environment we live in, put UK industry at the forefront of developing new technologies, and help encourage employment opportunities.
"The government also recognises the need for special consideration for energy intensive sectors, given both their energy usage and their exposure to international competition."
In line with the recommendations made by the Confederation of British Industry, there will not be a blanket "across-the-board" approach to setting tax rates.
The chancellor said the government agrees with Lord Marshall's recommendation that the levy must be designed in a way that protects the competitiveness of UK firms. It intends to recycle the revenues to business, and to cut the main rate of employer NICs by 0.5 percentage points.
Businesses will also benefit from schemes aimed at promoting energy efficiency directly and stimulating the take-up of renewables sources of energy, such as solar and wind power. The introduction of the climate-change levy will entail no increase in the burden of taxation on business.
The government also recognises the need for special consideration to be given to the position of energy intensive industries given their energy usage, the separate Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regulation and their exposure to international competition.
In line with the recommendations made by the CBI, the government will not be taking an "across-the-board" approach to setting the appropriate level of the new levy. Mr Brown said subject to any legal and practical constraints, the government intends to set significantly lower rates for those energy intensive sites that agree targets for improving their energy efficiency that meet the government's criteria.
John Prescott, deputy prime minister, has written to the trade associations of the main energy intensive sectors and will begin negotiations with energy intensive sectors shortly.
The government is pre-announcing this tax change to give businesses time to adjust. The new levy will be introduced in April 2001. The tax rates applying to different fuels will be set out in finance bill 2000. The government expects the levy to raise around £1.75bn in its first full year (2001-02) and save around 1.5 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010.
The levy will apply to gas (natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas), coal and electricity used by business, agriculture and the public sector for energy uses. It will not apply to fuels used by the domestic or transport sector, or fuels used for generation or non-energy purposes. The levy will not apply to oils, which are already subject to mineral oils duty. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

THE BUDGET: Work: National Insurance: Robin Hood ploy hits the higher earner

Author: Levene, Tony

Abstract: The changes will be phased in over two years from April 2000 when the employees' NIC starting level rises from pounds 66 to pounds 76. Anyone earning up to pounds 500 a week will then save pounds 1 a week. But those above pounds 510 will end up paying more. The new upper earnings limit where NICs stop will rise to pounds 535. Those with higher pay packets will pay pounds 2.50 a week, or pounds 130 a year, more. In 2001, NIC payments will start at pounds 87 a week to complete the planned alignment with income tax, mirroring the progressive merging of the Contributions Agency, which collects NICs, with the Inland Revenue. This will save most NI payers a further pounds 1.10 a week. Again, however, the upper limit is to be raised, this time to pounds 575. In total, top earners will pay pounds 5.40 a week more in April 2001 than they will from April of this year - some pounds 236.08 a year for those contracted out of the state pension scheme SERPS.

Full text: CHANGES in National Insurance Contributions over the next two years will benefit lower paid employees but hit those earning over pounds 500 per week. `This is Robin Hood help to the poor,' said John Whiting of accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers. `Higher earners will pay more.'
But although those making most in the self-employed ranks will also pay more for their stamp, the Chancellor stopped short of the expected `clobbering' of the growing army of those who work for themselves.
The changes will be phased in over two years from April 2000 when the employees' NIC starting level rises from pounds 66 to pounds 76. Anyone earning up to pounds 500 a week will then save pounds 1 a week. But those above pounds 510 will end up paying more. The new upper earnings limit where NICs stop will rise to pounds 535. Those with higher pay packets will pay pounds 2.50 a week, or pounds 130 a year, more.
In 2001, NIC payments will start at pounds 87 a week to complete the planned alignment with income tax, mirroring the progressive merging of the Contributions Agency, which collects NICs, with the Inland Revenue. This will save most NI payers a further pounds 1.10 a week. Again, however, the upper limit is to be raised, this time to pounds 575. In total, top earners will pay pounds 5.40 a week more in April 2001 than they will from April of this year - some pounds 236.08 a year for those contracted out of the state pension scheme SERPS.
But even though the higher earning self-employed will pay more, NIC expert Jim Yuill at accountants Ernst & Young believes they have escaped lightly. He said: `Martin Taylor's report on National Insurance and the Self Employed published 12 months ago said that the self employed get benefits on the cheap, so we were expecting a clobbering.'
All self-employed workers will gain from a cut in the flat rate stamp, officially known as Class 2 NIC, however. From the 1999-2000 the rate of pounds 6.55 a week (once profits top pounds 72.50 a week) will fall to just pounds 2 on earnings over pounds 73.50from April 2000. This payment is being retained as it serves as a passport to benefits such as the basic pension and disability payments.
There is a sting in the tail, however. Most self-employed people also have to pay a Class 4 NIC, which gives no benefits. Next month, Class 4 is payable on profits between pounds 145 and pounds 500 a week at 6 per cent. From April 2000, they will pay 7 per cent on earnings between pounds 85 and pounds 535.
Generally, those self-employed and earning up to pounds 9,460 a year will pay less; those earning pounds 27,820 or more will end up paying nearly pounds 300 a year extra.
Employers will be hit by the extension of their NIC to all perks, not just company cars. From April of next year, they will have to pay 12.2 per cent of the value of other benefits in kind such as cheap loans and private medical cover. This will hit big City employers the hardest - but they will be big gainers when employer's NIC is cut to 11.7 per cent in 2001, as compensation for the Climate Change Levy to encourage greener energy consumption.

To Gordon, this year small firms would like: [1 Edition]

Abstract: "We would like to see some sort of rate relief for small businesses," said FPB spokesman [Bill Anderson]. "Business rates fall much more heavily on small businesses." The FPB also wants [Gordon Brown] to introduce further measures to tackle the problem of late payment - often crippling for small business - and would like to see the integration of the National Insurance and PAYE. Brown may also announce tax-breaks for businesses that second staff into schools to teach entrepreneurship, another sign of Labour's conversion under Blair. Last November, Brown said: "We plan to enlist business leaders to take the world of work and business into classrooms. The Budget will allow businesses to claim tax relief when they second senior staff." "In principle this sounds very good," says [John Downie]. "However, it i not easy for someone from a small firm to be seconded for a week." IN his pre-budget report in November 1998, Brown announced his intention to double the number of firms in which all the employees are able to own shares. The proposal, achieved with tax breaks, has been broadly welcomed by representatives of Small Medium Enterprises. The Chancellor thinks giving more employees the chance to own shares in their companies will be an incentive to work harder and boost corporate performance. It is a key plank in his programme of bridging the productivity gap between the UK and other developed nations.

Full text:   Reductions in corporation tax rates to 30% for large companies and 20% for smaller companies, which have already been announced, will clearly benefit business. But Downie said that the benefits will bypass two-thirds of small businesses. "Reductions in the level of corporation tax make little difference to the typical small firm, two-thirds of which are not limited companies. If any government policy is intended to target small business, it must target the unincorporated sector. Such businesses pay income tax, not corporate tax. Successive governments have failed to understand this."
Downie supports measures that would permit small, unincorporated business to invest for growth, notably tax relief on reinvested profits. The FSB Scotland also advocates a reintroduction of capital gains retirement relief. "The phasing out of this relief discriminates against owners who have spent years building up a business, the sale of which they viewed as their pension," said Downie.
THE Chancellor will be out to impress corporate UK with his Budget on Tuesday. Gordon Brown believes that a recession has been avoided and that a soft landing for the economy has been engineered thanks to five successive cuts in interest rates to 5.5%.
As the Chancellor sat down this morning to put the finishing touches to his speech, he was in bullish mood about Britain's economic prospects. His Budget is therefore likely to be a five- pronged assault on Britain's economic problems, summed up with by the theme "a new economic platform for Britain".
The measures Brown will introduce would have been unthinkable under Old Labour. Many have already been trailed, including his desire to promote wider employee share ownership and to give a leg- up to entrepreneurial high-tech businesses with tax credits for research and development.
However, representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises in Scotland doubt whether Brown's third budget will be as business- friendly as all the pre-publicity suggests. Some members of the business community would prefer him to do nothing.
Last week, the Scottish TUC welcomed measures to boost productivity and competitiveness but said it believes action to stimulate investment must be prioritised.
"Such action could usefully include proposals to establish a Scottish investment bank, development of a programme of tax incentives to encourage investment in capital equipment and in research and development, and modification of the eligibility criteria for regional selective assistance to support the pre- production phase of new product development," said Bill Spiers, the STUC's general secretary.
Other areas which the Chancellor is expected to address include: THE small business lobby is concerned that from next month the government will increase employers' National Insurance contributions to 9.2% and 12.2% depending on individual earnings' thresholds.
"This will definitely diminish employment opportunities," warned John Downie, parliamentary officer of the Federation of Small Businesses. "Raising the level of contributions is a further disincentive to taking people on. We would have preferred to have seen a cut, which would have made the minimum wage less of an issue."
Bill Anderson, spokesman for the Forum of Private Business (FPB), said: "Politically, I would be very surprised if Gordon Brown would increase the rate for employers' contributions. If he does so, he can expect a salvo from this direction."
ROBERT Morris (pictured right), joint managing director of Glasgow-based Morris Furniture, said: "Manufac-turers use a lot of diesel for transportation, and its price must come down to European levels, which are half those in the UK." However, Brown will turn a deaf ear to the such pleas and go ahead with a 6% increase in duty on fuel. This will hit businesses and consumers in the Highlands and Islands particularly hard.
In October, Lex Gold, director of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce urged deputy prime minister John Prescott to rethink the "fuel price escalator" a system of annual 5%-6% increases in fuel duty introduced by the Conservatives in 1993.
Gold believes the escalator handicaps Scottish business and places British haulage firms at a disadvantage. In his reply, minister for roads Lord Whitty gave no hint that the government would reverse its strategy, which aims to drive cowboy hauliers off the road and ensure Britain meets the climate change commitments made at the Kyoto environmental summit.
THE Chancellor may also introduce a revised approach to how company cars are taxed. One possible change could be switching towards taxing the private use of corporate wheels, though Brown will need to be careful not to provoke the wrath of Britain's 10 million plus company car drivers.
Douglas Millar, deputy director of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said: "We are particularly concerned about the proposed levy on company parking spaces. In a survey of our members, these were widely opposed."
THE Forum for Private Business (FPB), which presented its submission to the Chancellor on January 22, has made the reduction of red tape central to its Budget wish list. New measures such as the minimum wage, Fairness at Work and the working-time directive will do little more than clog up personnel and payroll departments with additional paperwork.
"We would like to see some sort of rate relief for small businesses," said FPB spokesman Bill Anderson. "Business rates fall much more heavily on small businesses." The FPB also wants Brown to introduce further measures to tackle the problem of late payment - often crippling for small business - and would like to see the integration of the National Insurance and PAYE.
FSB Scotland's John Downie would like the government to eliminate the need for business-to-business credit transactions to be subject to VAT. He believes this makes for inefficiencies, and generates unnecessary additional paperwork as each party must reclaim VAT.
"The VAT credit system between EU member states should be extended to credit transactions between UK registered traders. Why not steal a good idea?"
Brown may also announce tax-breaks for businesses that second staff into schools to teach entrepreneurship, another sign of Labour's conversion under Blair. Last November, Brown said: "We plan to enlist business leaders to take the world of work and business into classrooms. The Budget will allow businesses to claim tax relief when they second senior staff."
"In principle this sounds very good," says Downie. "However, it i not easy for someone from a small firm to be seconded for a week." IN his pre-budget report in November 1998, Brown announced his intention to double the number of firms in which all the employees are able to own shares. The proposal, achieved with tax breaks, has been broadly welcomed by representatives of Small Medium Enterprises. The Chancellor thinks giving more employees the chance to own shares in their companies will be an incentive to work harder and boost corporate performance. It is a key plank in his programme of bridging the productivity gap between the UK and other developed nations.
But John Downie said: "The proposals will need to be adjusted to the special needs of the small business sector. If more employees in firms of under 50 are given the chance to own shares in the business, it would help resolve succession issues."
IT will be hard for Brown to be truly innovative, given the self- imposed fiscal constraints within which he has chosen to operate. But if the comments of some industry organisations are representative, the Chancellor will have his work cut out persuading the business constituency that he genuinely has their needs at heart.

Full text:   MORE and more serious financial experts believe our future wealth is written in the stars.
Hard-headed business types are looking at planet movements to see if they affect financial decisions, Stock Exchange fluctuations - and the risk of pay-outs for natural disasters.
Over the last 10 years, a number of specialist finance and business astrology consultants have been increasingly consulted on a regular basis by financial institutions.
Their clients include banks and insurance companies, shipping lines, retail chains and exporters.
So what do the stars tell about YOUR financial future? With expert help, we've compiled the chart above to give you some pointers.
A survey for NatWest among 1,000 cardholders last year showed people with the same star sign had similar spending patterns.
The bank's spokesman said the research started as a bit of fun. "We were surprised how often star signs seemed to match up.
"Now we could use dates of birth, which are on our database, for some financial promotions."
Stargazers' predictions about market movements and events such as the fall of the Berlin Wall have proved uncannily accurate.
Computer programmes have been prepared, predicting the prospects for companies based on the date of their incorporation and the star sign under which they were born.
The astrologers advise firms on decisions such as mergers and takeovers, and even the hiring of senior executives.
As for the approaching Millennium, astrologers point out that Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn will be in alignment with the Sun and the Moon in May 2000.
And some are predicting a great deal of gloom - if not final doom For charts show the last time the planets aligned was 6,000 years ago. And there is fossil evidence to show it coincided with a major phenomenon.
One Lloyds syndicate has commissioned research into whether unusual planetary conjunctions in 2000 could cause natural disasters.
That is not as daft as it might sound.
Astronomers believe such planetary movements have been linked to global events like climate change, crop failures, famine and floods.
Statisticians and climate experts are investigating theories that the planets exert powerful influences on each other.
A combined gravitational pull or increased surface storms on the sun might cause tidal waves, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes here on Earth.
It certainly offers the marketing men a ploy to sell more insurance...
Signs of the times...
Your fortune in the stars
ARIES
BIGGEST users of credit cards, more than two-thirds using plastic at least once a week. Hot on holidays and clothes, spending pounds 48 a month. Arians will have a job to hold on to money this year - better take advice. TAURUS
GOES for the good life. Taureans spend pounds 42 a month in restaurants and pounds 81 on petrol. A little more caution is called for this year. Build up your bank balance and have your fling in the new Millennium.
GEMINI
TWIN interests are looking good and dining out. Likely to indulge in splurge spending, but the flash lifestyle leaves less cash for holidays. You also dislike DIY, spending only pounds 23 a month. But it's time to think about the future.
CANCER
YOU'LL take tadvantage of loyalty schemes, or go for gold cards as status symbols. You also spend the most on eating out, at pounds 50 a month. But you're careful, and have enough to cope with emergencies.
LEO
CARING folk, who are most likely to pick charity affinity cards. Along with Geminis, you usually go on spending sprees when depressed. Money is unlikely to stick to you, so go for ethical investments - and treat yourself.
VIRGO
NOT keen on credit cards, you prefer to pay cash. You run up the second biggest bills for DIY and electrical goods at pounds 45 a month. You make sensible investments and spread risks... but you'll wait until after the Budget.
LIBRA
SPENDS pounds 82 a month on cars but tends to be frugal with everything else - including food, clothes and holidays. You could over-reach yourself this year, so don't make a move without talking to a financial expert.
SCOPRIO
SECRET spenders most likely to hide their credit card statements from partners. More plastic than anyone else, with 58 per cent having two cards and 21 per cent three or more. Spends least on holidays at pounds 718 a year.
SAGITTARIUS
WILL splash out on cars, but not so much on clothes and food at only pounds 179 a month. You want the best of both worlds - money in your pocket and security. Go for medium-term investments for growth and income.
CAPRICORN
YOU love your grub and spend pounds 210 a month on it, but clothes don't matter to you so you spend very little on them. Too self- reliant to rely on investments or advice. This could be the year to start your own business.
AQUARIUS
THE most self-indulgent, spending pounds 1,037 a year on holidays and pounds 480 a year on clothes. Less interested in DIY or electrical goods - only pounds 24 a month. Could be in for financially bumpy ride in 1999. Think long- term about savings.
PISCES
PASSIONATE about all you do. Keen on cars, spending more than the others on motoring at pounds 82 a month. Also more DIY than the rest at pounds 50. Usually good gamblers, but this is a year to consolidate and reduce risks.

Throne Speech reveals balancing act in store for Alberta
Health No. 1 priority, Klein says, but need for fiscal prudence, social spending also noted
Wednesday, February 17, 1999
Alberta Bureau
Edmonton -- The Alberta government will spend the next year trying to juggle demands for more social spending with the need to be fiscally prudent.
In the Speech from the Throne delivered yesterday, Ralph Klein's government, which is in the middle of its second mandate, indicated that it is attempting to find common ground between competing areas.
". . . My government strives to strike the right balance," said Lieutenant-Governor Bud Olson, who read the Throne Speech. "It will remain fiscally responsible. And it will keep working with Albertans on steady, targeted action on their priorities, especially health, education, the economy and the environment."
Indeed, Striking the Right Balance was the title of Mr. Klein's televised address two weeks ago and has become the cornerstone of the government's plans for the year.
David Taras, a political scientist at the University of Calgary, said Mr. Klein faces the difficult challenge of increasing social spending and lowering taxes, when provincial revenues have fallen and the province's population has grown substantially.
"The oil-and-gas bubble has burst," he said. "There's not going to be those mammoth, gargantuan surpluses, and so he's caught in all kinds of different directions."
The Throne Speech, which had few major announcements, stated the government will "continue to invest carefully" in social services, but the address lacked any specifics on social spending or on tax changes.
"While protecting these areas, the government will continue its leadership role in taxation. It will chart an innovative new course, ensuring that Albertans' taxes remain the lowest in Canada," Mr. Olson said.
The lack of specifics on money matters in the speech is partly because much of Alberta's spending for the next year is dependent upon the federal budget unveiled yesterday. Alberta has promised to match or exceed federal transfers for health.
Howard Sapers, the Liberals' treasury critic, said the lack of new initiatives is an indication that the government lacks focus. "This Throne Speech is evidence that they're still searching for the next thing to do," he said.
In the area of health care, the Throne Speech reiterated the government's intention to inform regional health authorities of long-term funding, to shorten waiting lists for some surgery and medical tests, and to study the impact of the province's aging population on social services.
"Without doubt, the priority area is health," Mr. Klein told reporters.
One new initiative was the creation of a new housing program for needy Albertans. Also, Mr. Klein introduced a bill to pay off the province's debt of $12.5-billion.
The government announced it will conduct an audit of school buildings in connection with health-and-safety issues. Repeating previously announced initiatives, the government said it would provide more training for math teachers to teach a new curriculum, improve resources for aboriginal children and double spaces for postsecondary students in computer-related programs.
On transportation, the government wants to see the implementation of the Estey report, which recommended giving farmers a greater role in moving their grain.
The government reminded Albertans it is studying environmental regulations "to ensure that it maintains the most stringent standards in North America." It will also revise legislation on protected areas -- a move against which environmental groups protested at the legislature yesterday. They say the government is eroding its commitments to the land.
The government will hold a climate-change meeting and study whether to develop a program to help flood-prone communities.

CLINTON'S BUDGET PLAN: [FIVE STAR LIFT EDITION]

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/clintons-budget-plan/docview/403902640/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: The budget calls for spending 62 percent of government surpluses expected over the next 15 years -- a projected $2.76 trillion -- to help bolster Social Security's cash reserves. (Bill) Clinton wants the government to invest about $700 billion of the cash in the stock market to try to increase its value -- the first time Social Security reserve money has been invested privately. With the rest, Clinton would use a complicated accounting strategy to simultaneously pay down the national debt and obligate more of the country's future resources to Social Security. Administration officials say the plan would keep Social Security from financial crisis until 2055. Clinton has also proposed using an additional 12 percent of government surpluses over the next 15 years -- or $536 billion -- to subsidize new 401(k)-style retirement savings accounts for most working Americans. Head Start, child care and foster care programs and would get increased spending. The budget calls for $6.3 billion over five years to expand the tax credit for expenses to families earning up to $59,000 a year and to families in which one parent stays home to care for children. It seeks $7.5 billion over five years to offer more child care subsidies to working poor families. For Head Start, Clinton wants a $607 million boost to $5.3 billion to serve an additional 42,000 children. The budget seeks to help children in foster care who turn 18 by letting them keep their public health insurance.

Full text: How President Bill Clinton's budget would be spent, along with the likely GOP response and how the issue or agency fared last year
SOCIAL SECURITY
CLINTON'S PROPOSAL
The budget calls for spending 62 percent of government surpluses expected over the next 15 years -- a projected $2.76 trillion -- to help bolster Social Security's cash reserves. Clinton wants the government to invest about $700 billion of the cash in the stock market to try to increase its value -- the first time Social Security reserve money has been invested privately. With the rest, Clinton would use a complicated accounting strategy to simultaneously pay down the national debt and obligate more of the country's future resources to Social Security. Administration officials say the plan would keep Social Security from financial crisis until 2055. Clinton has also proposed using an additional 12 percent of government surpluses over the next 15 years -- or $536 billion -- to subsidize new 401(k)-style retirement savings accounts for most working Americans.
LIKELY GOP RESPONSE
Republican leaders have agreed to set aside 62 percent of expected government surpluses while lawmakers discuss Social Security's future, but they disagree with the specifics of Clinton's plan. They are strongly opposed to having the government invest in the stock market, saying free enterprise would inevitably be corrupted by politics. They also have accus ed the president of using funny bookkeeping that would compound debts already owed to Social Security by the rest of the government without saying how they will ultimately be paid.
LAST YEAR
Clinton had asked lawmakers to hold off spending government surpluses during a year of town-hall meetings on Social Security's future.
TAXES
CLINTON'S PROPOSAL
The budget proposes tax credits and other tax relief totaling $36.2 billion over five years. Among those aimed at the middle class: a credit of up to $500 for stay-at-home parents caring for infants under age 1 and a $1,000 credit for people providing long-term care for disabled people. Disabled workers could take a $1,000 credit for costs associated with their jobs, employers would be encouraged to provide health insurance and the steel industry would get $300 million in breaks to combat foreign dumping.
The administration proposes $82 billion in new or increased taxes, led by a 55-cents-a-pack cigarette tax that would yield $34.5 billion over five years. Sixteen corporate tax loopholes would be closed, raising $7.1 billion. In total, the package envisions 79 new or increased taxes, mostly on business.
LIKELY GOP RESPONSE
Republicans are pushing a broad across-the-board income tax rate cut of at least 10 percent, as well as relief from the "marriage penalty" that hits millions of two-earner couples and elimination of the estate tax on inheritance.
LAST YEAR
The president proposed $24.2 billion in tax relief and $106.5 billion in new revenue, again led by tobacco taxes that never materialized.
CHILD CARE
CLINTON'S PROPOSAL
Head Start, child care and foster care programs and would get increased spending. The budget calls for $6.3 billion over five years to expand the tax credit for expenses to families earning up to $59,000 a year and to families in which one parent stays home to care for children. It seeks $7.5 billion over five years to offer more child care subsidies to working poor families. For Head Start, Clinton wants a $607 million boost to $5.3 billion to serve an additional 42,000 children. The budget seeks to help children in foster care who turn 18 by letting them keep their public health insurance.
LIKELY GOP RESPONSE
Head start has found considerable support among Republicans, as well as Democrats, in Congress. GOP leaders have preferred across- the-board tax cuts to more child care spending.
LAST YEAR
Clinton proposed a $22 billion child care program, which went nowhere in Congress, though there was GOP interest in aiding stay-at- home parents. After some skirmishes, Congress approved bipartisan legislation renewing the Head Start program.
HEALTH INSURANCE
CLINTON'S PROPOSAL
The budget asks for $44 million in tax credits to encourage small businesses to join coalitions to offer health insurance to workers. It seeks $2 billion over five years to help people with disabilities keep Medicare and Medicaid when they return to work and a new $1,000 tax credit to pay for needed adaptive technology and other special expenses.
The budget allows $1.1 billion over five years for states to offer Medicaid and the new children's health insurance program to many immigrants, including children, pregnant women and those with disabilities. Immigrants would be eligible even if they arrived in the country after enactment of the 1996 welfare bill.
LIKELY GOP RESPONSE
Republicans also want to encourage small businesses to join in health insurance purchasing groups. And bipartisan legislation to aid people with disabilities who want to return to work is pending in the Senate. But the GOP has been cool to restoration of benefits for immigrants, saying people should not come to the United States expecting public aid.
LAST YEAR
The House approved legislation aiding people with disabilities, though it did not include the centerpiece -- letting them keep health benefits. It died in the Senate. Some food stamp benefits were restored for legal immigrants.
EDUCATION
CLINTON'S PROPOSAL
Education spending would be $31.8 billion in 2000, increasing last year's estimated $28.6 billion. The increases would go to about $34.9 billion in 2001, continuing along those lines through 2004. Clinton called for $1.4 billion for the second year of funding for the so- called 100,000 new teachers initiative and for $22 billion in bonds for school construction and modernization. The White House lost a similar construction plan last year. The president proposes tripling an after-school and summer program aimed at ending social promotion and boosting teacher training. But he also proposes budget cuts to a program negotiated in last year's renewal of the higher education laws. He sparred with Republicans over subsidizing private banks' lending to students.
LIKELY GOP RESPONSE
Republicans say they're disappointed that the president did not fund local education block grants designed to give states and districts local flexibility and did not increase special education funding significantly. The GOP is looking at its own school construction proposals and wants to see results before doling out another round of funds for new teachers.
LAST YEAR
Congress approved a $33.11 billion plan for education programs, a 12.6 percent increase in which favored projects won big. Charter schools got a hefty 25 percent boost to $100 million.
TRANSPORTATION
CLINTON'S PROPOSAL
The administration wants to spend $45.5 billion on transportation, an increase of about 8.6 percent. Once again, there's more money for highway and aviation safety and more to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. There's also spending aimed at triggering economic growth, including about $180 million in loan guarantees for U.S. shipyards. A big gainer is the Office of the Transportation Secretary, where the budget would jump from $89 million to $132 million. The Coast Guard, which is overseen by the transportation secretary, would get $4.297 billion, up about 6.7 percent.
LIKELY GOP RESPONSE
Republicans are also talking about similarly isolating money for aviation improvements. But there could be a fight over an administration proposal to raise the Passenger Facility Charge, an airline ticket tax that is used for airport construction.
LAST YEAR
The administration and the GOP found themselves in agreement on transportation. They approved the nation's largest highway spending bill, $203 billion, and they agreed that all money collected through the gas tax would be spent on road, bridge and mass transit improvements.
DEFENSE
CLINTON'S PROPOSAL
The Pentagon would get $261 billion in new spending in 2000, including the largest pay raise for military members in nearly two decades -- 4.4 percent in 2000, followed by five consecutive increases of 3.9 percent. Nearly $3 billion would go for Bosnia peacekeeping and enforcement of no-fly zones over Iraq. Clinton wants $4.25 billion for missile defense in 2000. He asks Congress for two new rounds of base closings -- in 2001 and 2005.
LIKELY GOP RESPONSE
Republican proposals are roughly in line with Clinton's, calling for increased spending to modernize weaponry, improve troop living conditions and invest in missile defense. But the Senate Armed Services Committee already has proposed pay increases bigger than Clinton's.
LAST YEAR
Congress approved $264 billion for the Defense Department in the current year, including $4.5 billion in extra money to improve overall preparedness and pay for Bosnia and Iraq operations.
MEDICAL RESEARCH
CLINTON'S PROPOSAL
The National Institutes of Health would get a $320 million boost to its $15.6 billion budget. That's a 2 percent increase for NIH, the nation's biggest financer of medical research. It includes an additional $35 million for AIDS-related research, totaling $1.8 billion, and a new $50 million National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. The Food and Drug Administration, the nation's top consumer protection agency, would get a massive 17 percent increase, or an additional $190 million.
LIKELY GOP RESPONSE
For the NIH, Republicans have outspent Clinton for several years as part of their goal to double its funding by 2003, and the GOP is expected to pass a much larger increase again this year. Some Republican leaders have signaled support for some increased funds to the FDA to speed up new products.
LAST YEAR
Congress passed a 14 percent increase, giving the NIH $15.6 billion to spend in 1999. That was above Clinton's request for a 9 percent increase. Congress left the FDA's budget flat.
TOBACCO
CLINTON'S PROPOSAL
The government would raise $8 billion by imposing a new 55-cent-a- pack cigarette tax and by tacking on a 5-cent tax that wasn't supposed to kick in until 2002. Even without new legislation, the 24- cent cigarette tax is set to jump by 10 cents per pack next year. Under Clinton's plan, the tax would rise to 94 cents per pack in 2000. Over five years, these new tobacco taxes would raise an additional $34.5 billion -- a substantial chunk of the total $82 billion in new taxes and fees.
LIKELY GOP RESPONSE
Republicans oppose all new taxes, including cigarette taxes. As for recouping of state tobacco money, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are backing legislation to bar the federal government from seizing these dollars.
LAST YEAR
Clinton proposed new cigarette taxes as part of his comprehensive tobacco legislation, which died in Congress.
AGRICULTURE
CLINTON'S PROPOSAL
The Agriculture Department would get $55.2 billion in 2000 to fund a range of programs from food stamps to food aid and rural water programs. One major omission from the budget, however, is money to reform crop insurance for farmers. Clinton has also proposed $72 million, or a 24 percent increase, to boost food safety efforts within the USDA and Food and Drug Administration, including money for increased inspections and better research.
LIKELY GOP RESPONSE
Republican leaders are mostly unhappy with Clinton's lack of a plan to reform crop insurance. They are also likely to be fiercely opposed to a proposal that would require meat and poultry companies to pay "user fees" for government inspection services.
LAST YEAR
The current year's budget is actually about $8.2 billion higher than Clinton's 2000 proposal, mainly because of large aid packages last year for U.S. farmers and Russia.
MEDICARE AND LONG-TERM CARE
CLINTON'S PROPOSAL
The president wants 15 percent of government surpluses expected over the next 15 years -- a projected $686 billion -- to bolster Medicare. With that cash infusion, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, could hold on until 2020. Clinton also is proposing a new $1,000-a-year tax credit to help families pay for long-term care for elderly or disabled relatives -- something not covered by Medicare. The administration estimates 2 million Americans would benefit, at a cost to the government of $5.5 billion.
LIKELY GOP RESPONSE
Republicans leaders have not said whether their plans would leave money for Medicare. Before making any decisions about the program, they say they will await recommendations from a bipartisan advisory commission due to report March 1. Many support tax credits for long- term care expenses.
LAST YEAR
After trimming billions from Medicare payments in 1997, lawmakers were besieged by complaints from health care providers. Further spending curbs proposed by Clinton this year are sure to be controversial.
ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES
CLINTON'S PROPOSAL
The administration wants increases for most environmental programs. The budget proposed a $1 billion "land legacy initiative" that includes $900 million to buy land so it can't be developed. To help cities combat sprawl, the budget proposes new "Better America Bonds" -- financed by $700 million in federal tax credits -- to be used by communities to set aside "green spaces" and promote better urban planning. The budget calls for a $730 million increase in spending on research to address global warming, in cluding sharp increases in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.
LIKELY GOP RESPONSE
Congress rejected many of the same climate initiatives last year. A $200 million "clean air fund" will be viewed by some Republicans as trying to impose the climate agreement. While much of the proposed $900 million in spending for new land purchases may get a warm welcome in Congress, there likely will be arguments over where the money should be spent.
LAST YEAR
The administration won more money for energy efficiency programs and as part of a last-minute budget agreement got an additional $200 million for climate change technology.

Full text: The mayor of Venice was not very welcoming. Late and irritated, he stormed into his study - a stately, deep red room worthy of a doge - on the piano nobile of Ca' Farsetti, a palazzo overlooking the Grand Canal by the Rialto bridge.
Once home to the academy of young artists, counting the sculptor Canova among its gifted pupils, the building is now the city hall. The mayor sat down at a fine old circular table piled high with books, papers, and files.
A desk in one corner was overcrowded with more books, a fitting setting for the man known in Italy as the "philosopher mayor". At the top of the heap lay a set of well-worn reports devoted to "Moses".
Massimo Cacciari, a refined scholar in his mid-50s, with a beard to excite an old master painter, a youthful demeanour betrayed by tired, half-closed eyes, shifted impatiently on his chair. "Ask me precise questions," he snapped, trotting out in Latin a maxim of Bishop Berkeley, an 18th century Irish cleric and philosopher. "Esse est percipi" (Perception turns into reality).
"Some years back, Venetians had no such perception," he said, referring to the idea that one colossal project could resolve overnight what is universally called the "Venice problem" - how to save the moody lagoon city and its precious heritage from sinking.
"Mainly thanks to you, the media, and in particular the Anglo-Saxon press, Venetians now think one project will provide salvation. It is an infantile, Hollywood-esque approach, the idea that one big undertaking transforms itself into a comic book super-hero stuffed with steroids rushing to the rescue of the city."
Only a couple of months ago, after 30 years of heated, often sterile debate on the future of the city and its lagoon, Superman finally seemed to be about to drop in. An independent panel of five world experts appointed by the Italian government concluded last July that the big project, known as Mose (Moses in English), offered the best solution to protect Venice from high waters. A few years ago, the Italian public works ministry had approved the ambitious scheme in principle.
Mose, an Italian acronym for "electro-mechanical experimental model", consists of mobile floodgates submerged at the three entrances to the lagoon. With the arrival of unusually high tides, the gates would rise to protect the city from the acqua alta . A prototype has already been built and tested and can now be seen parked beside the city's arsenal.
Its promoters, the Consorzio Venezia Nuo`va, a group of large private enterprises granted exclusive rights by the government in 1984 to implement measures to protect Venice and the lagoon, have been waiting for the final government go-ahead to release the $3bn of state funding needed to undertake and complete the job. The consortium was led by Impregilo, Italy's largest civil engineering company. It claimed that Venice would have been saved from the epic flood of 1966 if the mobile barrier had been in place then.
Memories of that awful November night 33 years ago are vivid. The local news-paper, Il Gazzettino, wrote at the time: "The air became unbreatheable. Along with the carcases of animals, the dead bodies from the cemetery floated through the streets and entered the houses." Everything had conspired against the city: the phase of the moon, the wind, a sharp drop in barometric pressure, an unusual swell in the Adriatic - together they provoked the worst flood in living memory. The sea rose nearly two metres. St Mark's Square, one of the lowest points of the city, was covered with more than 1.2 metres of water.
Venice is used to floods. There are chronicles as early as 527 AD of high waters ravaging the lagoon. But conditions like those of 1966 occurred in the past on average once every 800 years. Now, according to the Venezia Nuo`va consortium, they could come every 200 years because the sea level has been steadily rising as a result of subsidence and changing weather conditions caused by global warming.
A huge effort was undertaken, in spite of political squabbling and all the familiar shortcomings of Italian bureaucracy, to repair sea walls, churches and palazzi, and the artistic heritage left to decay by years of negligence and incompetence.
All kinds of schemes, some completely dotty, were considered to defend the city. The Pirelli company devised a system of massive floating sausage-shaped rubber tubes to protect the lagoon mouths; a Venetian suggested placing sponges in the waters by St Mark's; another idea was to use retired oil tankers as swinging barriers at the lagoon entrances. The consensus soon settled on the mobile gates.
Then, just before Christmas, an Italian government commission studying the environmental impact of Operation Moses on the lagoon dropped a bombshell. Moses should be scrapped because it risked seriously damaging the lagoon's fragile eco-system. A few weeks later, Edo Ronchi, the environment minister, issued a decree indefinitely postponing the project.
He argued that the scheme, as it stood, would shut off the lagoon from the sea too many times during the year, thus turning it into a stagnant mire. The project could eventually be reconsidered only after a series of other initiatives to safeguard Venice had been completed. These included raising the ground level of the city and the islands in the lagoon and cleaning the waters polluted by industrial and city waste and heavy maritime traffic.
Franco Carraro, the consortium's chairman, a former mayor of Rome and currently president of the Italian football league, said the decision reflected a "religious and ideological war" waged for years by environmentalists with little bearing on scientific and technical evidence. The floodgates would provide Venice with the ultimate long-term "insurance policy" complementing other, more conventional measures.
"We concluded unanimously that though by no means perfect, the project was the best solution to defend Venice from high waters," Professor Jean-Marie Martin, director of the European Commission's environment institute at the Ispra research centre on the banks of Lake Maggiore, said this week.
It was a matter of choice: "Do you prevent the lagoon turning into a lake or do you save Venice and its historic heritage? Personally, I would save Venice."
The controversy has continued to rage with the government coming under renewed pressure to reconsider its position. Private international fund-raising associations have warned that without Moses there seemed little point in continuing to finance the restoration of old monuments if, one day, they would all be washed away. Others counter that there is no point in spending $3bn now on a project when the next really bad flood could be 167 years away.
The mayor has been un-settled by the latest fuss. His population's growing perception that without Moses all is lost could undermine his administration's efforts to revive and modernise his decaying city while preserving its artistic legacy.
Cacciari has fought the central government - "our country is the worst-centralised state in Europe", he said - by trying to set up his own Catalan-style federalist party and bringing together the mayors of other cities in a movement called "Centocitta" (100 cities) to defend and promote local interests against the tentacles of the Rome government.
At the end of the day, Cacciari said he did not oppose Moses. He simply wanted the issue of high waters kept in perspective. "The problem of the acqua alta does not resolve the city's other problems. Granted it is a big problem, a quantifiable problem - but not an extraordinary problem," he argued.
Venice is regularly flooded when the sea rises more than a metre, which happens on average about seven times a year. If the waters rise 1.20 metres, about 25 per cent of the city is flooded. "But we are only talking about 10cm of water, not the sort of levels [that would] wash away and drown the population," said Cacciari. If it rises above 1.60 metres - the last time was in 1979 - the entire city is flooded with 30-40cm of water. Only exceptional floods of two metres, as in 1966, put the entire human and architectural fabric of Venice in serious danger.
Other Italian cities also ravaged by floods in 1966 were more at risk today than Venice, Cacciari added provocatively, Florence in particular. The Tuscan city suffered even more damage, destruction and deaths when the banks of the Arno burst that year. Since then, little, if anything, has been done to prevent a similar disaster.
"A sword of Damocles hangs over that city and yet everybody continues to agitate about Venice," the mayor said angrily.
By all accounts, Venice is still sinking. Scientific studies showed that the sea level had risen by 23cm this century. But recent Italian national research council measurements have also suggested that over the last 25 years the trend has slowed, mainly because the pumping of groundwater for industries on the mainland had stopped. The city was now subsiding at the normal average long-term rate of geological subsidence in the world of 2cm to 4cm per century. But the sea level has continued to rise. Professor Martin said it had risen to a new record of 27.6cm in 1996 at the Salute, the baroque church by the Grand Canal.
Scientists estimate that climate change caused by the "greenhouse effect" could raise the sea level during the next century by between 13cm and 94cm. But as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 1995 report when global warming finally became a serious international issue: "The changes in future sea level will not occur uniformly around the globe."
While scientists continue to argue, a tide of other troubles risked swamping Venice, tourism for one.
Next Friday, the city will be shaken from its misty winter slumber by the start of the annual carnival.
More than 10m tourists visit Venice every year, including 7m day-trippers. As their numbers rise relentlessly, the Venetians are continuing to desert their city. There were more than 170,000 living in the city 50 years ago. Now there are only 69,000, according to the last census.
More than 30,000 commute daily to the city's historic heart to work in hotels, restaurants and tacky souvenir shops. At night, the "finest drawing room in Europe", as Napoleon described St Mark's Square, is now, in the words of one Venetian, "the rather sad boudoir of an ageing contessa".
It is an image that irks the mayor. Venice was not just a magnificent heap of monuments. He said it was now the largest cruise ship port in the Mediterranean. It had the country's third-busiest airport, which was about to be privatised. It was attracting new high-tech industries. It was reaffirming itself as a centre of learning.
Its petrochemical industries on the nearby mainland were finally becoming more eco-sensitive. The city was building itself a new future which the floating floodgates, as currently planned, could also threaten.
If the lagoon entrances had to be closed 30 or 40 times a year every time the tides rose by a metre (in practice they would have to shut when the water level reached 80cm), then "we might as well shut down the entire port", said Cacciari.
The fundamental problem was that the international community of Venice-lovers did not, subconsciously at least, really want to save Venice at all. "From Byron to Mann to Woody Allen, they have all hankered after Atlantis," said Cacciari. For centuries, the world had been drawn to this fragile and magnificent city resigned to its fate of drowning one day under water. The crumbling palazzi, the mists, its sense of unreality were all part of the fascination.
"The only one who had the right idea was that old fascist Ezra Pound," said the mayor as he rose to leave. "I prefer his Venice, the Venice of Carpaccio, of prostitutes and of grande scopate (the Italian for truly memorable screws)".
In short, Venice, like Venus, is rising. A city alive and kicking, believing in its future; not a romantic, somewhat pessimistic dream of a vanishing world. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Full text: DECEMBER and January are the months when nature reminds Australians just how tenuous is our hold on this country and how vulnerable we can be on the high seas. Much the same could be said about the rest of the world's population.
In environmental terms, we may be winning the battle but losing the war. We are making some progress in piecemeal environmental reforms but overall the situation is getting worse.
1999 will be a big year for environmental stories. First, there will continue to be disasters of all kinds: bush fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and droughts. As insurance companies have pointed out, the last few years have been their worst on record for these disasters. Things are not going to get any better.
We can also expect another bad year on climate change. This ties in with some of the disaster stories: the disasters are due partly to the change in climate. The next big United Nations climate change conference will not take place until October this year and even then not too much is expected from it. Governments are still not willing to make the major changes that environmental non-governmental organisations have been recommending.
Cities are reaching their limits to growth. People are driving more and enjoying it less. More roads are not the answer. But people love their cars and governments lack the funds for a major expansion of public transport. Gridlock on the roads will follow the gridlock in transport policy.
The oceans are being over fished. The recent tragic yacht race was a reminder of how rough the waters can be off Australia's coast. And yet, as fish stocks are declining elsewhere on the globe, fishing vessels are having to come all the way into the waters near Australia to catch fish. About half the world's fishing fleet could be scrapped and yet the remaining half would still catch the same amount of fish. There are too many fishers chasing too few fish.
The six billionth human being will be born some time this year. The world's population growth is gradually slowing down but it will take many decades to level out.
Are people poor because they have babies or do they have babies because they are poor? People in Third World countries are not sex mad. They have babies because they have no other old age pension.
As a society gets richer, so fewer babies tend to be born. In Australia, children bury their parents. In Third World societies, parents bury their children. children die each day in Third World countries simply because of a lack of clean water and sanitation. If parents had a greater confidence that their babies would live, then they would have fewer babies.
IF THIRD WORLD parents had access to welfare systems, unemployment benefits and old-age pensions, they would have less incentive to have children. In developed countries, parents make a conscious choice between having children or acquiring more consumergoods. However, to create richer societies will require more consumption of raw materials. This will place an additional burden on the environment.
Finally, the Year 2000 computer problem could also have an environmental dimension because of the computer chips in nuclear power, drinking water, waste treatment, and chemical processing plants. Some of these could fail one year from now. The Year 2000 problem is not just for large financial corporations and aircraft.
People have told me that they will spend January 1, 2000 in bed and so avoid the dangers of machines (such as computers and lifts) going wrong. They will also need to include avoiding toilets and drinking water.
The 20th century could be called the century of economics" because of the rapid economic growth, especially in the century's second half. The 21st century will be called the century of the environment", not because we will all suddenly have become green" and environmentally friendly but simply because the environmental problems will be so large that they will loom over all our lives. Keith Suter is the author of Global Agenda: Economics, the Environment and the Nation State.

Abstract: As (President) Clinton revises the final draft of another State of the Union address, a reality check on last year's rhetoric finds that almost none of the most important domestic proposals made it into law. Some were stalled after bitter debates in Congress; others were never even discussed by congressional committees.

Some of his proposals never made it to a vote. "The president was able to get Congress to protect the (budget) surplus and begin hiring 100,000 teachers, but that's about all the Congress did this past year," acknowledges Bruce Reed, the chief White House domestic policy adviser.

Full text:   WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON -- One year ago, President Clinton was interrupted more than 90 times with applause -- not to mention several standing ovations -- as he delivered a 74-minute State of the Union address jammed with policy initiatives and soaring ambitions.
What's happened to those proposals since then?
Not a lot.
As Clinton revises the final draft of another State of the Union address, a reality check on last year's rhetoric finds that almost none of the most important domestic proposals made it into law. Some were stalled after bitter debates in Congress; others were never even discussed by congressional committees.
A tobacco bill, a $22 billion child-care initiative, a "patient bill of rights," campaign finance reform, subsidies for school construction and expansion of Medicare to 55-to-65-year-olds all remain no more than ideas.
Clinton had some victories, including ratification of NATO expansion and a down payment on his plan to hire 100,000 more elementary school teachers to reduce class size.
But Congressional Quarterly calculates that last year he scored the lowest "success rate" with Congress of any president in his sixth year of office since CQ started its tally with the Eisenhower administration -- lower than Richard Nixon in 1974, the year he resigned from office because of the Watergate scandal.
Clinton prevailed on 51% of 154 votes on the House or Senate floor on which he took a clear position, the sixth lowest annual score of any president in any year since the Capitol Hill publication began tracking voting records 46 years ago. Some of his proposals never made it to a vote.
"I'd give him a `D,' " says James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington.
The Monica Lewinsky scandal on top of Republican control of Congress and Clinton's lame-duck status combined to make it "deadly difficult to get anything done," he says.
"The president was able to get Congress to protect the (budget) surplus and begin hiring 100,000 teachers, but that's about all the Congress did this past year," acknowledges Bruce Reed, the chief White House domestic policy adviser.
Although Clinton was unable to enact his domestic agenda, he was largely successful in preventing Republicans from enacting theirs, notably a big tax cut.
Here's an accounting of what happened to a baker's dozen of the president's most rousing calls for action in last year's State of the Union.
"I propose that we reserve 100% of the surplus -- that's every penny of any surplus -- until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century."
The task of ensuring Social Security's long-term solvency didn't progress beyond talk last year. Still, Clinton's call to "save Social Security first" fulfilled its other objective: making it politically difficult for Republicans to deliver on their plans for broad tax cuts using the first federal budget surplus in 30 years.
"I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grades. . . . I also propose a school construction tax to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools."
A budget bill at the end of the congressional session included $1.2 billion for the first year of Clinton's plan to reduce class size by hiring more teachers. Still, Congress made no commitment to fund the rest of the five-year, $7.4 billion plan. A proposal to subsidize school construction also went nowhere.
"I will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiating authority necessary to open more new markets, create more new jobs."
A proposal to give the president special "fast-track" authority -- which requires Congress to vote yes or no on trade treaties without amending them -- became enmeshed in such complicated political maneuvering that the White House refused to weigh in when it finally came up for a vote in September. The House overwhelmingly voted it down.
"Medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants. I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a Consumer Bill of Rights."
The House passed a GOP version of the "patient bill of rights," but the Senate leadership refused to schedule a vote. The proposal is intended to ensure that patients in managed care plans have access to specialists, a process for appealing denial of care and other protections. Clinton took executive action giving the guarantees to the 85 million people insured through Medicare, Medicaid and federal employee health plans. But congressional action is needed to apply them to the 125 million Americans in employer-based health plans.
"Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance. . . . So I ask the Congress: Let these hard-working Americans buy into the Medicare system."
The president made a rare visit to Capitol Hill to introduce a bill that would allow the near-elderly to buy into Medicare. But congressional committees didn't even hold hearings.
"I challenge Congress: Let's pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that improve public health, protect our tobacco farmers and change the way tobacco companies do business forever."
Despite a fast start out of the Senate Commerce Committee last spring, a huge tobacco bill was stalled in the Senate after a bruising battle and a multimillion-dollar TV ad campaign run by cigarette makers. The defeat was bad news for other Clinton proposals that were to be funded in part by proceeds from the tobacco bill, including his child-care initiative.
"Here's my plan: Help families to pay for child care for a million more children."
Congress didn't consider his $22 billion request to increase grants to states and offer tax credits to help working families pay for child care. But funding for after-school programs grew five-fold to $200 million.
"I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO."
The Senate ratified the treaty admitting the three former Warsaw Pact nations to the Western alliance, a significant victory for Clinton.
"I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and their mission in Bosnia."
Clinton twice won funding for the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.
"I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction."
The Senate didn't ratify or hold hearings on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
"It's long past time to make good on our debt to the United Nations."
Clinton's repeated entreaties to pay $1.2 billion in debts to the United Nations sank because the issue became tied to an unrelated dispute over funding international organizations that advocate abortion rights. On the other hand, he did persuade Congress to make $18 billion available to the International Monetary Fund with an argument that it would help prevent a global economic meltdown.
"Everyone knows elections have become too expensive, fueling a fund-raising arms race. . . . I ask you to strengthen democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year."
The House passed a campaign finance bill, but Senate reformers repeatedly failed to muster the 60 votes needed to break a Republican filibuster. That blocked a vote on legislation barring national political parties from raising "soft money," the unlimited and unregulated donations that typically come from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals. The bill would have tightened regulation of so-called "issue ads," which can help candidates even though the ads don't explicitly advocate voting for them.
"Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action."
In November, the administration signed a global-warming treaty negotiated in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan. But officials have delayed submitting it to the Senate, where ratification seems unlikely, until more developing countries agree to take steps on the issue. And Congress ignored Clinton's proposal to create tax incentives to encourage more efficient energy use, a step aimed at cutting the gas emissions produced by burning fossil fuels that are blamed for causing global warming.
Clinton's 1998 proposals haven't vanished. In the 1999 State of the Union address Tuesday night, aides say he will not only unveil new initiatives but also recycle many of last year's ideas -- from expanding Medicare for the near-elderly to enacting a "patient bill of rights" and especially to overhauling Social Security.
"In last year's Congress there was a good deal of partisanship, and hopefully at some point, we'd be able to move beyond that, move to the center and get some of this work done for the American public," White House chief of staff John Podesta says.
But because the Lewinsky story hasn't ended, Congress is still under Republican control and Clinton's lame-duck status hasn't changed, other analysts say it's hard to imagine why the legislative climate in 1999 will be much friendlier than it was last year.

Full text: Everyone talks about the weather, that's for sure. A hailstorm of predictions by climatologists assures us we'll be growing warmer, getting colder, enjoying less sun, enduring more . . .
At the time many people around the country were reading a news story saying the 1990s was the hottest decade on record, Jack Murray, the mayor of International Falls, Minn., was preparing for his daily constitutional.
It was just before 6 a.m. Tuesday, still dark out. The thermometer read: -1 degree Fahrenheit.
"That's the coldest part of the day, of course," Murray said on Thursday. "I put on just about every piece of clothing I have. When it's that cold out you have to wear a face mask, especially if the wind is blowing."
The wind was blowing.
This would never deter Murray, who has been making a 3.5-mile walking tour of the downtown for at least as long as he has been mayor, which is 14 years now.
"Cold is cold," said Murray, a lifelong resident of what is routinely the coldest town in the continental United States.
A caller asked him if he noticed any long-term warming trends.
"It finally warmed up today to 1 above (zero). We've been way below zero since before December," Murray said in a voice like warm cocoa. "We were joking, 'We've got an Indian summer.' "
Nothing, not even politics as practiced by Tip O'Neill, is quite so local as weather. If it's raining on me, it's raining all over the world. There may be a similar parochialism blowing like a Chinook now through the scientific community.
The story that appeared on Tuesday contained dramatic statistics released by two federal agencies, indicating that 1998 was the hottest year on record at an average 58.1 degrees - 1.2 degrees higher than normal. Moreover, the '90s as a whole have capped off a rapid warming trend beginning back in the 1970s. So far, the decade has registered temperatures 0.71 degrees higher than the 119-year average.
Must be global warming, say the people who believe in global warming. Their theory is that the world is producing huge and dangerous amounts of carbon dioxide, which is trapping radiant heat from the Earth and slowly cooking us. One meteorologist quoted in Tuesday's story called the record temperatures "the canary in the mine, so to speak."
But let's take a longer view. Say a thousand years or so longer.
Back in Y1K global temperatures were about 2 degrees warmer than they are today. Yes, warmer.
The period from roughly 750 to 1250 A.D. is known by climatologists as the "Medieval Optimum." It's a rather optimistic sounding term and, in truth, its consequences were not entirely disastrous.
Some scholars argue that warmer temperatures at higher latitudes enabled the Vikings to traverse the northern Atlantic, settling Greenland, which then was indeed green, and Newfoundland, which they named Vinland for its abundance of vines.
The "Medieval Optimum" was followed over the ensuing several centuries by an equally cold spell known as the "Little Ice Age." This is just standard climate fluctuation, argue the people who do not believe in global warming. If carbon dioxide is to blame for the heat, they ask, how is it that carbon dioxide levels were so much lower back in 1000?
Nonetheless, the prediction is for warmer temperatures right through the next 40 years. Expect a 0.3-degree jump every decade, says the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
But is this due to industrial pollution or utterly uncontrollable solar cycles? Will it ultimately lead to "relentless heat waves, beaches submerged by rising sea levels, contaminated drinking water, and more severe and damaging hurricanes," as Florida Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson opined in 1996. Or will more warmth mean more bountiful plant life?
What's most confusing is that there are well-respected meteorologists out there who think the world will be getting colder soon. Just part of the cycle, they say. Sulfur dioxide, another industrial pollutant and also a byproduct of volcano eruptions, could also be to blame; hovering in the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide reflects the sun's rays back into space.
"You can't deny climate change," said William Gray, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. "Whether human beings are affecting it much, we don't know."
In a state as flat as a tile floor, the prospect that the sea level might rise a few inches can give the chills to any homeowner with a water view. But try to think about global warming from Jack Murray's point of view.
In International Falls the warm weather can never come too soon.

Early bird is key to global warming: [FINAL Edition]

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/early-bird-is-key-global-warming/docview/312811694/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Without needing to be prompted by the weekend's collapse of Beachy Head, which the Environment Agency said was climate change-induced, Government scientists have quietly started to monitor and bring together a mass of small and large events, both in the natural world and in society, which may be the first signs of a hotter planet. The indicators they have chosen range from the arrival dates of swallows in spring and the leafing dates of oak trees, to the number of possible skiing days in Scotland, the number of insurance claims for "major weather perils" and the number of human cases of Lyme Disease, caused by a tick which flourishes in warmer weather. Much of this evidence is startling and when it is assembled, as the Government is doing, it is compelling. The orange tip butterfly, for example, is now emerging about 11 days earlier than it was 20 years ago. The leaves on oak trees at a monitored site in Surrey are emerging about three weeks earlier than when records began in 1947 and the swallow is arriving earlier at eight different bird observatories. Twenty species of birds have shifted their egg-laying dates an average of 8.8 days earlier in the 25-year period from 1971 to 1995.

Full text: THE GOVERNMENT is to monitor the arrival of the first swallow in spring to check on the progress of global warming.
It is one of 35 indicators which have been officially chosen to detect the initial signs of climate change.
Without needing to be prompted by the weekend's collapse of Beachy Head, which the Environment Agency said was climate change-induced, Government scientists have quietly started to monitor and bring together a mass of small and large events, both in the natural world and in society, which may be the first signs of a hotter planet.
Some of these are already strongly suggesting that climate change is no longer a theoretical calamity predicted by the supercomputers of the Met Office, but is already with us.
The indicators they have chosen range from the arrival dates of swallows in spring and the leafing dates of oak trees, to the number of possible skiing days in Scotland, the number of insurance claims for "major weather perils" and the number of human cases of Lyme Disease, caused by a tick which flourishes in warmer weather.
The first indications, certainly from the evidence assembled about the behaviour of birds, plants and insects, is that the greenhouse effect is now here. Over the past twenty years many events in the natural world have started to take place much earlier in the spring, in a way entirely consistent with a warmer climate
Much of this evidence is startling and when it is assembled, as the Government is doing, it is compelling. The orange tip butterfly, for example, is now emerging about 11 days earlier than it was 20 years ago. The leaves on oak trees at a monitored site in Surrey are emerging about three weeks earlier than when records began in 1947 and the swallow is arriving earlier at eight different bird observatories. Twenty species of birds have shifted their egg-laying dates an average of 8.8 days earlier in the 25-year period from 1971 to 1995.
The importance of the Government's new initiative to bring all this together is that for the first time it puts official emphasis on monitoring, as well as prediction.
Until now most of the effort and funding in the fight to combat global warming - hundreds of millions of pounds - has gone into climate prediction. Scientists with complex computer models could happily tell you what was likely to happen in 50, 75 or 100 years, but were unable to tell you what was happening now, as noting that the egg-laying date of the chaffinch was weeks earlier than before was regarded as a suitable occupation only for types in anoraks.
But official recognition has finally come of the fact that dramatic trends may suddenly emerge from large numbers of small observations, once they are plotted, and the need to observe the many minute changes which may be the first signs of a dramatically warmer world is now accepted.
The mass of information is being brought together in a single database, coordinated by Professor Melvin Cannell of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology in Edinburgh.
His unpublished pilot study, "Indicators of Climate Change in the UK," which is now being reviewed by officials at the Environment Department, contains an initial 35 indicators chosen to register global warming's effect. They begin with climate and temperature itself. Obvious measures such as the number of hot and cold days and the amount of rainfall are joined by subtler indicators like soil moisture amounts, amounts of groundwater stored in chalk and the number of times a year the Thames Barrier is closed (an indicator of the rising sea-levels global warming is predicted to cause).
Social indicators include the value of annual domestic claims for subsidence (which increases in very hot dry summers), amount of gas consumed in winter, and the number of holidays taken within the UK. Agricultural indicators selected include areas of vineyards in the UK, yields of non-irrigated potatoes and the amount of late summer hay yields. These latter two categories are more likely to show changes once climate change is firmly established. But it is the changes in wildlife behaviour that are pointing to global warming's arrival already.
Two of the scientists helping coordinate the Government's data, Tim Sparks, of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology at Monk's Wood near Peterborough, and Humphrey Crick, of the British Trust for Ornithology, gave remarkable information of their own on climate- related changes in plant life last week when they published the first report of their new monitoring network.
They compared the flowering of four different plants in 1998 with records made a century ago and found all to be much earlier.
Mr Sparks, who is an environmental statistician, holds a number of similar remarkable records not yet in the Government database. He quotes the Hertfordshire Natural History Society, whose record of the dates of arrival of six migrant species of birds show the swallow is now arriving in Hertfordshire on about March 26 as against April 8 in the 1890s.
"All these records show changes in behaviour which is entirely consistent with a warmer climate," Tim Sparks said.
"Soon," said Humphrey Crick, "We shall be waiting for the first swallow of the winter."

ENVIRONMENT CANADA REPORTS Ice, heat dominated 1998 weather stories

Abstract: "The sharp increase in global temperatures in the past few years has added to the strong and compelling evidence of humankind's contribution to climate change," Phillips said.

Full text: OTTAWA -- Environment Canada says destructive weather has been the top newsmaker in Canada for the past three years, and cites January's ice storm as the most crucial Canadian weather story of 1998.
Last year, the Red River flood was the top story. In 1996, the Saguenay River flood.
This year's ice storm killed more than 30 people, caused $3 billion in damage and destroyed 1,000 transmission towers.
Climatologist David Phillips, who writes the Canadian Weather Trivia Calendar each year, says the ice storm brought down enough wires to wrap around the world three times.
"What made the ice storm so unusual, though, was that it just wouldn't end," said Phillips, who decided this year's top weather stories.
The six-day storm that stretched from Georgian Bay to Nova Scotia sparked 700, 000 insurance claims for $1.5 billion -- three times the largest amount ever paid for a natural disaster in Canada. Governments and industry lost at least another $1.5 billion.
Although 1998's top story was about ice, record heat washed across Canada all year long.
"Maybe in 10 years I'll look back and say this should have been the (top) story, if it turns out to be the start of a trend," Phillips said. "Statistically, we should expect a year like 1998 once every 2,500 years," he said.
Six months of this year set individual records for warmth, and El Nino alone can't explain the heat.
"The sharp increase in global temperatures in the past few years has added to the strong and compelling evidence of humankind's contribution to climate change," Phillips said.
Even though the Pacific El Nino current stopped flowing months ago, it left behind heat stored in our country's vast water reservoirs that kept the weather warmer than normal.
Phillips predicts 1999 will be colder than this year because El Nino is no longer a factor.
"But I still think it will be warmer than normal. I think the trend will continue."

Natural disasters caused $90 billion in damage: [5 Edition]

Abstract: Worldwide natural disasters caused 50,000 deaths and economic losses of more than $90 billion in 1998, the second highest figure ever, according to reinsurer Munich Re. Munich Re said that compared with the 1960s, the past 10 years had seen three times as many severe natural disasters that cost the world's economies, after adjusting for inflation, nine times as much and the insurance industry 15 times as much. The main reasons for this increase are the growing concentration of population and valuable property in large cities often located in high-risk zones, it said.The increase in tropical cyclones, heat waves, forest fires and ice storms could only in part be explained by natural climate fluctuations of the El Nino and La Nina weather patterns, the reinsurer said.

Full text:   Worldwide natural disasters caused 50,000 deaths and economic losses of more than $90 billion in 1998, the second highest figure ever, according to reinsurer Munich Re.
In a statement, Munich Re said this compared with 13,000 deaths and damages of $30 billion in 1997.
Thanks to a combination of global warming and unusually heavy rain, 1998 was "a year with an exceptionally large number of natural catastrophes . . . that claimed the lives of about 50,000 people throughout the world," it said.
Its annual review found 1998 economic losses were exceeded only by 1995's $180 billion, much of which was caused by the Kobe earthquake in Japan.
Munich Re said that compared with the 1960s, the past 10 years had seen three times as many severe natural disasters that cost the world's economies, after adjusting for inflation, nine times as much and the insurance industry 15 times as much.
The main reasons for this increase are the growing concentration of population and valuable property in large cities often located in high-risk zones, it said.The increase in tropical cyclones, heat waves, forest fires and ice storms could only in part be explained by natural climate fluctuations of the El Nino and La Nina weather patterns, the reinsurer said.
La Nina is a natural climate change associated with colder water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean around the equator. It normally follows its more famous sibling El Nino, which is associated with a warming of Pacific waters.
"A key role may also have been played by the fact that in terms of the mean global temperature, 1998 was by far the warmest year since measurements were first taken worldwide around 150 years ago," the statement said.
The year saw severe floods and cyclones such as Hurricane Georges in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, which, with its insured losses of $3.3 billion, was the third most expensive in U.S. insurance history and the largest insurance loss of the year, Munich Re said.
Its successor, Hurricane Mitch, killed an estimated 11,000 people in Central America, most of them in Nicaragua and Honduras.
Munich Re said warmer winters were causing more frequent and severe storms and this long-term trend was continuing.
"A further advance in man-made climate change will almost inevitably bring us increasingly extreme natural events and consequently increasingly large catastrophe losses," the firm's head of geoscience research, Gerhard Berz, said in the statement.
"The progress achieved at the fourth climate summit in Buenos Aires at the beginning of November is not enough to halt global warming and stabilize the world's climate in the long term," he said.
Munich Re itself registered more than 700 large-loss events in 1998 compared with between 530 and 600 annually in recent years, with most being caused by wind and flooding.
Other insured events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, forest fires, droughts, heat waves, cold spells, landslides and avalanches were much less frequent and caused much less damage than in previous years.
The company was not optimistic.
"Even radical environmental protection measures cannot prevent the occurrence of ever more and ever costlier natural catastrophes worldwide," it said.

Full text: Third of four-parts
After a year of wildly unpredictable weather, almost everybody who is anybody in the earth sciences agrees that one doubt has been laid to rest: global warming is for real.
Extreme weather events were one of the major signals predicted by those who believe the earth is warming up -- and this year delivered in spades.
There's still scope for scientific argument about how fast global warming is occurring, what's causing it and what the long-term consequences might be, but there is general consensus that the planetary thermometer is on the way up.
One of the best-known research establishments now says the temperature is going way, way up, with the prospect of a runaway greenhouse effect that will boost land temperatures by a whopping six degrees over the next century.
Britain's Hadley Centre for Climate Change, which constructs mathematical models of world climate on one of the world's biggest supercomputers, says the billions of calculations in its last program show the earth is heating up much more rapidly than previously thought.
This forecast is thought to be the most accurate yet, because its predictions are based on data include far better models of the world's ocean currents, which serve as the great heat transfer system that regulates over-all planetary climate.
In fact, if the earth were a medical patient, we'd be worried about the way the fever has spiked upward even now. While the earth has warmed about two degrees over the last 500 years, half that increase has occurred in the 20th century. And about 80 per cent of this century's warming has taken place since the industrial revolution began pumping factory smoke into the atmosphere.
Some scientists have long speculated that loading the atmosphere with carbon dioxide and other gases might trigger a greenhouse effect, trapping heat from the sun and raising the surface temperature of the planet in ways that could alter climatic cycles.
Then, in 1996, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reached consensus -- global warming was a fact and the volume of greenhouse gases meant the world would almost certainly continue to heat up. But by how much? That was less certain and the IPCC agreed on a range of average temperature increases between 1.8 and 6.3 degrees over the next century.
But what that might mean is still subject to debate. Some see a future of milder winters and expanding agricultural production, with severe weather events diminishing as the temperature differences between the poles and the equator even out. Others, however, foresee shrinking agricultural production as droughts and floods increase in length and severity, the conversion of vast tracts of forest to arid grassland and the loss of fertile agricultural land in river estuaries and alluvial plains as sea levels rise.
The Hadley Centre now projects a much bleaker world in which parts of the Amazon rainforest will become a desert, triggering a greenhouse effect that will become unstoppable after 2050. In that scenario, 200 million people will be subject to ocean flooding. Millions more will suffer hunger as severe drought sweeps through the breadbasket of the American midwest, wiping out the wheat surpluses on which much of the world depends. Africa will also suffer severe drought. Parts of the eastern seaboard of the U.S. and southern Europe will become desert. Renewed epidemics of tropical diseases will invade the former temperate zones. And rising sea levels will make populations living on the low-lying coastal fringes and fertile river estuaries vulnerable to the most powerful hurricanes the world has ever seen.
Ten years ago, James Hansen of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies got into scholarly hot water for saying the greenhouse effect was real and that global warming was under way.
Now British, Canadian, American, German and Swiss research teams from a score of universities, government agencies, private corporations and non-governmental organizations and institutes have weighed in with confirmation of his views.
"When you break the record seven months in a row, it is hard to ignore the fact that something is going on and that something is global warming," U.S. Vice-President Al Gore concluded after reviewing the most recent evidence.
Henry Pollack, a scientist from the University of Michigan who headed up an international team that took temperature readings from 358 boreholes drilled in Europe, North America, Australia and South Africa said last month the findings support the greenhouse theory.
"Our results . . . are fully consistent with the conclusion that human activity is a significant driving force behind global warming," he told Associated Press reporter Paul Recer.
From remote satellite sensors to 50,000-year-old ice drilled from the Greenland ice cap, from the sophisticated computer models generated by Andrew Weaver's world class climate laboratory at the University of Victoria to an Algonquin Park naturalist's observation that the gray jay seemed to be moving north along with the rising temperature, better evidence than ever is now under analysis.
And what began as contentious theory more than a decade ago now has a convincing body of hard evidence to support the hypothesis.
Among the most telling signals:
- Six of the first eight months of 1998 were the warmest since records began in 1866.
- July goes into the books as the hottest month ever.
- Nine of the hottest years on record have occurred since 1988.
- Temperatures in northwest Canada and Alaska are rising three times faster than across the Arctic as a whole. Permafrost is melting. In Alaska, mean annual temperatures a metre below the surface have risen a full degree since 1989.
- Mountain glaciers are melting at an accelerating rate.
- Familiar plants, insects, birds and animals are appearing in unexpected landscapes or disappearing from traditional ones as their ranges expand and contract.
- Massive ice shelves are disintegrating along the coastline of Antarctica.
- One of the worst seasons on record in Tornado Alley, the corridor where violent windstorms track from the Gulf of Mexico as far north as Ontario.
- The long-predicted rise in ocean levels is already affecting low-lying islands in the South Pacific. Small islets have submerged and farmers are moving crops to higher ground as salt water contaminates fields where staple food crops are grown.
- Severe weather predicted by computer models of global warming has begun to afflict vast regions of the globe.
Of all these signs, scientists say, the most convincing after the temperatures themselves are the extreme weather events predicted by Hansen.
"As you get more global warming, you should see an increase in the extremes of the hydrological cycle droughts and floods and heavy precipitation," he told Time reporter Sharon Begley two years ago.
That prediction is based on the idea that, as the earth warms up, more moisture evaporates. That means greater precipitation in places where it normally rains but less in places where it is normally dry. Coastal fringes like B.C. can expect more rain and snow in the winter and hotter dryer summers. But the continental heartland of southern Alberta and the wheat belts of Saskatchewan and Manitoba can expect longer, more intense periods of drought on a more frequent basis.
The last time it warmed up in the Prairies was during the 1930s, when the dustbowl years depopulated much of the deep rural hinterlands.
If rising temperatures suck more moisture into the air, that means more massive energy exchanges between atmosphere and ocean. In other words, the warmer the ocean, the more powerful the tropical cyclones and typhoons.
Just as Hansen predicted, 1998 delivered a whole platter of extreme events, from droughts that fried Europe and the American plains to flash floods as unprecedented volumes of rain washed over lands that had lost their holding capacity due to deforestation and urbanization.
The hurricane season just concluded was the worst on record and it spawned two of the most powerful storm cells ever seen, one in the Pacific and one in the Atlantic.
Paul Kovacs, an analyst with the Insurance Board of Canada who heads up the new Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction, says his industry has no doubt that the weather is changing for the worse and that global warming is responsible.
"The numbers tell the tale," he said. "Every five years or so the costs of weather-related disasters have doubled. You watch that trend for a little while and the numbers really start to scare you.
The new reality is that the weather is not nice.
"There's an international discussion going on about severe weather," Kovacs said. "It really is worse. And it's going to get even worse yet. There's enough scientific knowledge saying we'd better do something."
The last three years, he says, have been the costliest in history for the Canadian insurance industry.
It will pay out $1.5 billion in weather-related claims by year end. That's in addition to $1.2 billion in direct assistance from federal and provincial governments.
Worldwide, the bill for severe weather over the last three years totals about $180 billion according to Munich Reinsurance Corporation, one of the world's biggest underwriters.
Munich Re's Geoscience Research Group has been systematically collecting and analyzing information on natural catastrophes from around the world for 25 years. The nucleus of this is a database that has been fed all recorded losses resulting from natural events throughout the world since the mid-1980s.
The insurance giant says its research shows the past year was by far the warmest since worldwide records began and confirms the pronounced trend toward rising temperatures. It, too, fingers global warming as the culprit responsible for the extreme weather that plagued the world this year.
"On the basis of today's estimates, the man-made greenhouse effect to which this rise in temperature is attributed could lead to a further increase of several degrees within the next century unless decisive measures are taken soon to reduce the most significant greenhouse gases," said Gerhard Berz, the head of Munich Re's research team.
THURSDAY: What the weather means to you and why you should care. Severe weather only becomes a disaster when it happens where people live. But as more people move to more sensitive areas, the potential for catastrophe grows.
ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF SEVERE WEATER ON THE U.S.
Average number of disaster declarations has increased from 25% between 1979 and 1983 to 46.6% between 1994 and 1998
- an 86% increase
Worldwide, the economic loss related to natural catastrophes in the last 10 years is 85 times the cost in the 1960's (adjusted to present values). Between January 1 and July 31, 1998, extreme weather events caused 376 deaths and $14.4 billion in economic loss in the U.S.
American communities experienced more than $5.3 billion in insured losses due to weather related events in the first eight months of 1998
The U.S. government spent more than $1.3 billion in disaster assistance in the first eight months of 1998.
The damage was not centralized in one area of the country. The five states experiencing the most damage were Minnesota, California, North Carolina, Tennessee and Newyork.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Natural disasters caused 50,000 deaths and damages costing more than $90 billion US in 1998, the second-highest figure ever, the world's largest reinsurers said Tuesday.
In a statement, Munich Re said this compared with 13,000 deaths and damages of $30 billion in 1997.
Citing a combination of global warming and unusually heavy rain, 1998 was "a year with an exceptionally large number of natural catastrophes, [which] claimed the lives of about 50,000 throughout the world," it said.
It said the 1998 figure was exceeded only by 1995's $180 billion, much of which was caused by the Kobe, Japan, earthquake.
Munich Re said compared with the 1960s, the past 10 years had seen three times as many severe natural disasters that cost the world's economies -- after adjusting for inflation -- nine times as much and the insurance industry 15 times as much.
Reasons for this included the growing concentration of population and valuable property in large cities often located in high-risk zones, it said.
The increase in tropical cyclones, heat waves, forest fires and ice storms could only in part be explained by natural climate fluctuations of the El Nino and La Nina weather patterns, according to the company.
La Nina is a natural climate change associated with colder water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean around the equator. It normally follows its more famous sibling El Nino, which is associated with a warming of Pacific waters.
"A key role may also have been played by the fact that in terms of the mean global temperature, 1998 was by far the warmest year since measurements were first taken worldwide around 150 years ago," the statement said.
The year saw severe floods and cyclones such as Hurricane Georges in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, which, with its insured losses of $3.3 billion, was the third most expensive in U.S. insurance history and the largest insurance loss of the year, Munich Re said.
Hurricane Mitch, killed an estimated 11,000 people in Central America, most in Nicaragua and Honduras.
Munich Re said warmer winters were causing more frequent and severe storms and this trend was continuing.
"A further advance in man-made climate change will almost inevitably bring us increasingly extreme natural events and consequently increasingly large catastrophe losses," the firm's head of geoscience research, Gerhard Berz, said in the statement.
"The progress achieved at the fourth climate summit in Buenos Aires at the beginning of November is not enough to halt global warming and stabilize the world's climate in the long term," he said.
Munich Re registered more than 700 large-loss events in 1998 compared with between 530 and 600 annually in recent years, with most being caused by wind and flooding.
Other insured events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, forest fires, droughts, heat waves, cold spells, landslides and avalanches were much less frequent and caused much less damage than in previous years.
The company was not optimistic about the future.
"Even radical environmental protection measures cannot prevent the occurrence of ever more and ever costlier natural catastrophes worldwide," it said.

Abstract: The Health Minister should be doing better than this. But despite his intelligence and star quality, the hepatitis C fiasco made this another tough year. Mr. [Allan Rock] has drawn so many lessons from his travails that he isn't sure who he is any more. A few months ago, he proclaimed himself an unrepentant activist; now he's trying to learn to allow issues to bubble up in his department without making them his own.

Tuesday, December 29, 1998
Parliamentary Bureau Chief
Ottawa -- Jean Chrétien: C+

  

This was the year the Prime Minister's linguistic fumbling went from mildly endearing to absolutely infuriating. On hepatitis C victims, the falling dollar, the use of pepper spray (repeatedly), the bombing of Iraq -- you name it, the Prime Minister had something silly or overly harsh to say. Canadians no longer are in doubt: Jean Chrétien is not, if he ever was, just a regular guy.
On the more substantive issues of managing the country, though, he was both competent (the Supreme Court reference on Quebec sovereignty and the budgetary surplus) and lucky (the Quebec election).
Mr. Chrétien once said the most important decisions he would make as Prime Minister would be the selection of his ministers. Here's our report card on his team.

  

Lloyd Axworthy: A-

  

The Foreign Affairs Minister continues to make an impression with his soft diplomacy. Last year's land-mine treaty was followed by this year's International Court of Justice. Canada also won a coveted seat on the United Nations Security Council. Within the government, Mr. Axworthy's musings at the ill-fated APEC summit last year about the need for a more human approach became Mr. Chrétien's rhetoric this year. Our only reservation about Mr. Axworthy concerns whether he promotes Canada's interests as well as he does its ethics.

  

John Manley: A-

  

The Industry Minister has helped put Canada ahead of the curve when it comes to building the electronic infrastructure for the 21st century. His Connecting Canadians policies are successful enough that the Prime Minister now is trying to horn in. Mr. Manley is probably the most accomplished policy minister in the government. Too bad so few people know about it. And therein lies the problem -- he still hasn't demonstrated he can communicate to a broad audience. Nor has he been tested yet by a truly controversial agenda. Still, competence should be rewarded.

  

Paul Martin: A-

  

The Finance Minister is so schooled in the political arts that he has even turned major policy retreats into victories. The moment that most captured his capacity for landing on his feet came with his total reversal in July on his seniors' benefit. It takes a big man to admit he is wrong, one of his main opponents responded in praise. Mr. Martin continues to be a vigilant watchman of the nation's finances and, unlike most in government, seems to be working from some overall plan. Then there was his sure-footedness over the bank mergers. He has failed, however, to follow through on last February's education budget, which makes him appear overly opportunistic. Mr. Martin may not know it, but his next great challenge -- now that the deficit is yesterday's news -- is ensuring that middle-class living standards get unstuck quickly. Canadians were willing to grant him a grace period to clean up past messes; judgment time is fast approaching.

  

David Anderson: B+

  

A Fisheries Minister who's actually on the side of the fish. What a rare catch. After a number of false starts, Mr. Anderson may have finally found his métier. He survived the second coming of TAGS, which is the best he could have hoped. A salmon treaty with the United States could take him over the top.

  

Anne McLellan: B+

  

It used to be said that she could learn a thing or two about being Justice Minister from Allan Rock. Now it is said that Mr. Rock could learn from her. Well aware of the pitfalls of her portfolio in her Alberta fiefdom, she has so far finessed things by maintaining a low profile and, when forced into public on victims' rights or young offenders, striking a careful balance. She even skirted the gun-control debate, which remains all Mr. Rock's. Her real strength comes in playing the inside game, whether through her contributions as chair of cabinet's social-policy committee or as the lead federal negotiator in the social-union talks with the provinces. Her continuing deficiency is in her outside game, which she'll have to develop to become a complete politician. She lacks skill as a communicator, nearly blew the Supreme Court reference and is generally reluctant to push the PMO beyond her given mandate.

  

Stéphane Dion: B

  

The quality and quantity of the Intergovernmental Affairs Minister's letter writing tailed off his year. But that was probably appropriate, given it was to be a Quebec election year. In fact, Mr. Dion's rare willingness to fade into the background during the campaign was one of his greater achievements this year. The other was the controversial Supreme Court reference, which did not blow up in his face -- as many feared -- and which may provide material for future letters. He still suffers from a certain brittleness with colleagues.

  

Sheila Copps: B-

  

Her makeover is complete -- both politically and physically -- which doesn't make her leadership material but is a big improvement on her first term of government. She is plowing ahead on tough files such as magazines. And she has been effective in forging an international alliance of cultural-protectionist nations. There is nothing wrong with a Heritage Minister fighting with the Americans. Indeed, it's probably just the place to channel her aggression -- so long as she's smart as well as tough.

  

Art Eggleton: B-

  

The Defence Minister opened the year with the purchase of search-and-rescue helicopters; now he has to prove he can improve the quality of life for the troops. He and his Chief-of-Staff, Maurice Baril, were deft in their handling of sexual-harassment allegations. But Mr. Eggleton showed a ridiculous sense of self-importance in trying to keep his divorce proceedings secret -- national security and all that.

  

Ralph Goodale: B-

  

The Natural Resources Minister may have been converted to the realities of climate change while in Kyoto, but we're still waiting to see a credible plan of action. He was caught in the middle of a nasty dispute over the future of the Canadian Wheat Board and did his best to find a fragment of middle ground. He also played big in propelling an emerging farm-income crisis, especially in his native province of Saskatchewan, up the government's priority list.

  

Herb Gray: B

  

If extinguishing Opposition fire during Question Period is the sign of a great Deputy Prime Minister, then Mr. Gray deserves an A. (He is living proof why they don't call it Answer Period.) As minister responsible for the millennium, he is more pork barrel than poetry. Mr. Gray is a great survivor and a much-revered figure within the government. But we're really not sure about his day job, which may be the point.

  

Pierre Pettigrew: B-

  

The Human Resources Minister isn't a big fan of the Ottawa game (anything to make a break for his Paris apartment), but he's won a few rounds this year nonetheless. With the aid of strong caucus support, he secured refinancing for a series of job-creation programs set to expire. And his child benefit remains the model for the social-union talks. Mr. Pettigrew needs to get serious in a hurry about the lack of unemployment-insurance coverage for the majority of the country's unemployed. His department so far has put more energy into fudging the numbers than fixing the problem.

  

David Collenette: C+

  

The nation's highways have no more vociferous proponent in Ottawa than the federal Transportation Minister. But his eyes tend to be bigger than Paul Martin's stomach. Still, Mr. Collenette remains an unrepentant voice of Trudeau Liberalism, as his advocacy of Toronto's homeless suggests. And his approach to franchising Via Rail lines demonstrates a degree of innovation.

  

Herb Dhaliwal: C+

  

As a small businessman, the Revenue Minister's main passion has been to simplify his department's forms -- a laudable enough goal. The big item on his agenda this year was the spinning off from Revenue Canada of a new National Revenue Agency, which the feds hope will allow for a highly efficient single tax collection point. But so far he's failed to persuade the provinces to climb aboard.

  

Don Boudria: C

  

What you see is what you get with the Government House Leader -- a good riding politician whose constituency has expanded to include the House of Commons. He is a tireless worker, but tends to be overly partisan. And he has to bear responsibility for the fact the Liberals were twice caught by Reform without a single member in the House.

  

Sergio Marchi: C

  

The International Trade Minister is stronger on salesmanship, where his outgoing nature is a plus, than on policy. He understood the political shortcomings of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment better than the substantive shortcomings. Canada's rapid climbdown on MAI was a bit too rapid for our tastes, especially for a minister who once championed the other side of the issue. Mr. Marchi, sometimes a good communicator, would nonetheless gain greater respect if he kept his verbosity in check.

  

Marcel Massé: C

  

A highly competent figure, he seems well suited to the detail work of a Treasury Board President. But he has never developed the political chops to go along with his obvious intelligence. He ran into trouble on a bill that, purposely or not, would have eroded the independence of the president of the CBC. And it is hard to figure any more what his legal rationale is for appealing last summer's big pay-equity ruling in favour of public servants.

  

Lyle Vanclief: C

  

The otherwise invisible Agriculture Minister shot into prominence at the end of the year as the champion of a farm-bailout package. He played his role well, although we're still not clear on exactly how things went so bad for so many so quickly. And what happened to their savings from the good years? His package still bears scrutiny and therefore so does the minister.

  

Jane Stewart: C-

  

The Indian Affairs Minister started out strongly this year with the statement of reconciliation on residential schools. But the so-called healing fund is mired in predictable red tape. And there is a feeling that her early momentum is dissipating. Moreover, the minister too often simply seems to be reading what's been put before her and, in Question Period, is too quick to resort to labelling questioners racists. You sometimes wonder if her heart is really in it. The big test for her is the Nisga'a treaty in British Columbia. So far, the federal government hasn't stuck out its neck very far in selling a landmark deal it spent years negotiating.

  

Al Graham: D+

  

As Government Leader in the Senate, he presides over a Liberal majority that has dropped the ball several times on government legislation. Mr. Graham did manage to secure an emergency $41-million Christmas bailout for Devco, the porous coal mine in his native Nova Scotia. That takes care of the locals, but we're not so sure it's great policy.

  

Diane Marleau: D+

  

Nobody in our office can think of much to say about the International Co-operation Minister.

  

Fred Mifflin: D+

  

A charter member of Atlantic Canada's pitiful cabinet brigade, the Veteran Affairs Minister (why is that full cabinet rank, anyhow?) doesn't live up to the strong-regional-minister archetype preferred in Newfoundland. He looked weak in his native Newfoundland on TAGS. He still hasn't emerged from the shadow of Premier Brian Tobin. At Veterans Affairs, he succeeded in getting a group of merchant seamen to stop starving themselves and won some money for Hong Kong veterans.

  

Lucienne Robillard: D+

  

The first of Mr. Chrétien's "saviours" from Quebec, the Immigration Minister still has never got unstuck as a federal minister and wields little influence in Ottawa or in Quebec. She allowed a proposal about a French requirement for immigrants to float out in public for too long before squashing it (it didn't help those colleagues with large Asian populations in their ridings). Her new citizenship rules are by and large sensible -- the complaints of foreign business immigrants notwithstanding -- but are hardly inspiring. You get a feeling she isn't quite comfortable either in her portfolio or the Chrétien government.

  

Allan Rock: D+

  

The Health Minister should be doing better than this. But despite his intelligence and star quality, the hepatitis C fiasco made this another tough year. Mr. Rock has drawn so many lessons from his travails that he isn't sure who he is any more. A few months ago, he proclaimed himself an unrepentant activist; now he's trying to learn to allow issues to bubble up in his department without making them his own. So far, he's succeeding with the Health Protection Branch, a fiasco that predates him and that he's managed well. The big test will come with February's health budget. And it will be a big test in finding policy room between the decentralists in cabinet, who want to put money back into unconditional transfers, and the activists, who are seeking greater federal visibility. It doesn't help that the provinces don't trust Mr. Rock. But if he is ever to be Prime Minister, these tribulations will prove invaluable life experiences.

  

Alfonso Gagliano: D

  

The Prime Minister put him in charge of a new cabinet committee on communications, which hasn't been heard from since. That's the way with Mr. Gagliano -- he's from that ilk of politicians for whom passivity is everything. As the Liberals' chief organizer in Quebec, he fared poorly in the Sherbrooke by-election. As Public Works Minister, the former accountant was unable to provide a credible estimate for the costs of renovating the Parliament buildings. He unceremoniously directed blame at a public servant.

  

Lawrence MacAulay: D

  

His move to Solicitor-General in place of the fallen Andy Scott has to be one of Mr. Chrétien's weirdest cabinet appointments. Sure Mr. MacAulay is fiercely loyal to the PM and has even put him up when Mr. Chrétien has visited PEI. But the Solicitor-General, no matter how low his profile normally, is responsible for some serious stuff such as the national police, the prisons and our spy agency. It demands a heavyweight with a sense of independence from the centre, not a reliable pal.

  

Christine Stewart: D

  

The Environment Minister finally accomplished something in establishing new sulphur-emission levels. But over all she continues to be ineffective in a department that requires a strong minister (Mr. Chrétien has never given it one) who will vigilantly safeguard our long-term good in the face of short-term political and economic pressures. So far, she hasn't shown herself to have that mettle.

  

Andy Scott: (Incomplete)

  

The APEC affair sullied what was looking to be a moderately promising record. Mr. Scott had the good sense to drop out and, perhaps, try again another day.

  

Claudette Bradshaw: (No grade)

  

The Labour Minister transferred into the class too late to write exams. But the early scouting report is favourable: Unlike many cabinet colleagues, she brings a record of achievement into office through her founding and nurturing of Moncton's acclaimed Headstart program. The government desperately needs a credible social-policy voice.

Full text: INSURANCE companies and councils drafted in hundreds of extra staff yesterday to deal with emergency calls from members of the public affected by the gales.
The total cost of the damage could run to hundreds of millions of pounds, with Scotland's 32 local authorities alone facing repair bills of tens of millions of pounds.
Changing world weather patterns have led to increasing numbers of claims on insurance policies.
Earlier this month, a seminar in Edinburgh was told that insurers might have to stop providing building cover in certain circumstances because of frequent damage by storms and floods. Environmental campaigners have also warned that a huge leap in premiums could result from climate change.
Some councils in Scotland already have set aside funds to cover such damage rather than pay higher insurance premiums.
Mr Malcolm Tarling, spokesman for the Association of British Insurers, said it was "too early" to quantify the cost of the damage.
He said: "It could be weeks or even months before we can put a price on the cost. An incident of such magnitude could cost tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds across the UK."
However, he did not appear unduly concerned about the "fallout" from the weekend storms. "It won't worry insurers who make allowances and expect to shell out huge amounts each year to pay for weather- related damage," he said.
"Customers also should not face increased premiums because of an isolated incident such as this."
A spokeswoman for the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities said councils would take "every step necessary" to ensure public safety following the gales.
"Public safety is paramount. The costs to ensure effective and swift repairs to damaged property is secondary and will be assessed afterwards."
A spokesman for Glasgow City Council, Scotland's largest local authority, said it set aside a separate repairs budget each year after deciding that insurance premiums to cover costs of storm damage to properties were too expensive.
He added that it was too early to quantify the cost of the damage, which led to 200 extra building services staff and dozens of social workers being drafted in after the storm, but he estimated that it would be considerable.
He said: "We would hope in a very unusual situation like this that the Government would come up with emergency funds, in line with the Bellwyn Formula, to cover some of the repair costs."
Under the formula, the Government provides 85% of repair costs above a certain threshold.
''Improvements to council properties which were due for repair before the storms may now have to be delayed until the next financial year to allow us to find cash to deal with the damage caused by the gales," he said.

Full text:   The Year in Review
This year the weather was unavoidable. OK, weather is never avoidable - but this year, it was also unforgettable. And not just in the region hit by the January ice storm: in 1998, weather issues were front and centre in many parts of the world.
For much of eastern Canada, it was, above all else, the year of the ice. Millions of our lives were disrupted by five days of freezing rain that coated Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston, Granby and many other Quebec and Ontario communities in a layer of frigid glass. Power outages lasted more than a month in the "triangle of darkness" on Montreal's South Shore. Thirty-five people lost their lives.
The storm demanded superlatives: the most expensive weather event, the largest peacetime mobilization, the greatest number of downed trees and pylons. It dominated daily life not only in the days of the storm but in the following weeks as well, weeks when thousands of people were still living in shelters and when the electricity network remained as fragile as a sick child.
Could it happen again? We're not sure. But we do know enough to doubt Hydro-Quebec's assurances that the ice storm was a 1-in- 10,000-year event. The climate was never so predictable as that, not even in the good old days when it was predictable at all.
As the months passed and the ice storm receded from the front of our minds, most Canadians were slow to realize that other countries, too, were enduring their own weather disasters. Three countries in South America were hit by terrible flooding in April, but few of us knew about their difficulties.
It took the incredible Asian floods to bring other people's weather back to our attention. The low-lying delta nation of Bangladesh is accustomed to floods - but not to the kind of inundation it endured in 1998. Three-quarters of the country sank under water, inflicting horrendous damage on Bangladesh's economy and its long-term prospects for development.
China's flooding was on an even more epic scale. Imagine a weather disaster that disrupts the lives of more than 220 million people. The flooding was responsible for at least $30 billion U.S. in damages, and it washed away 5.6 million homes. Other countries in the region also experienced terrible losses from the power of onrushing water: India, Nepal, Pakistan and several of the Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union.
But it would be a gross mistake to call these "natural disasters." The term implies some catastrophe beyond our reach or making. In truth, most of Asia's weather-related disasters were also human-related - human-caused, even.
Take the Chinese deluge, for instance. Massive soil erosion in Sichuan province played a part in the catastrophe; so did logging and land-reclamation projects along the Yangtze River. The Yangzte basin now has only 15 per cent of its original forest cover. Drainage of lakes and other bodies of water has enabled China to build many thousands of houses and farms; but the drainage eventually comes at a price. The Chinese government, by encouraging large-scale reforestation, finally appears to have understood that price.
For the amount of rain that fell on China last summer was high but by no means unprecedented. It was human interference in the environment that made the rainfall so devastating.
It's a similar story with the floods that assailed Nepal, northern India, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. All these areas lie in the shadow of the great Himalayan mountains: the highest in the world. All are vulnerable to the impact of deforestation. As the mountains become increasingly denuded, they can no longer retain large quantities of snow and rain.
The result is a time bomb that explodes with increasing frequency in much of Asia. Even the flooding in Bangladesh, hundreds of kilometres away from the mountains, owes much to the wanton clear- cutting of Himalayan forests.
"More and more," said American climate-change expert Seth Dunn, "there's a human fingerprint in natural disasters. We're making them more frequent, more intense and more destructive."
Fall brought no respite from the news of bad weather. This time it was a pair of ferocious hurricanes, Georges and Mitch, that laid waste to large chunks of Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Honduras and Nicaragua. Awed by TV pictures of the destruction, Canadians showed quick and impressive generosity - along with our longstanding aversion to examining what lies behind the spectacular damage.
For these hurricanes, like the January ice storm, were not merely natural phenomena. Their dramatic strength was a result, in part, of global climate change (or, to use a misleadingly cozy phrase, "global warming").
Why did the ice storm last so long? It wasn't just a freak of wet air. It was also the product of a strange disruption in the jetstream - a disruption caused by El Nino, that upswelling of warm water in the Pacific that enables the tropical oceans to release a buildup of heat.
At the end of the year, Caribbean hurricanes accomplished a similar feat. And no, it's not just your imagination: there really are more of these violent storms than there used to be. The past four years, a time of the most devastating El Nino on record, have also been the most active four-year period for tropical storms since records began.
But the hurricanes, like the Asian floods, had such a terrible impact partly because of human activity. Central America has some of the highest rates of deforestation in the world: according to the Worldwatch Institute, the region is losing up to 4 per cent of its forest cover each year. Honduras has burned or cut down half of all its trees. The steep, bare, eroding hills were unable to absorb water from the storm.
To the south, much of Brazil continued to endure a long, harsh drought. It's no accident, no mere quirk of fate, that Brazil also burned 52,000 square kilometres of forest this year. The Amazon forests - the lungs of the planet - continue to turn to smoke and ash. In the absence of such forests, tropical soils quickly dry out, worsening the effects of a lack of rain.
On a global basis, the Worldwatch Institute says, the 1980s saw total losses of $55 billion U.S. because of weather disasters. In 1996 alone, the figure reached $60 billion - in other words, a single year proved more costly than the entire previous decade. Unhappily, 1998 set a new record. This year, the first 11 months saw damage estimated at $89 billion.
Small wonder that businesses as well as governments are beginning to pay attention. One way or another, climate change affects most of the things that people do. The economy is intimately connected with the environment - and, by extension, with the weather.
But, thanks to global climate change, the weather seems less and less predictable. We don't yet know if 1998 will prove to be the warmest year on record; it will certainly be one of the warmest. The forest fires in Brazil, Indonesia and Siberia played short-term havoc with the weather in nearby areas. As yet, nobody knows what effect they will have on weather far away.
It's clear, though, that in the closed atmospheric system of our planet, nowhere is truly far away. The levels of PCBs and other hazardous chemicals are higher in much of the Arctic than they are in the Great Lakes. Chemicals that can be shown to originate with industries in Ontario, Michigan and New York have turned up in northern Scandinavia.
In our part of the world, the year is winding down amid news of another weather-related story: water levels in the port of Montreal are at their lowest in more than 30 years. Record low levels have also been recorded this fall and early winter in the Great Lakes, and the flow of water through the Ottawa River is only half its usual capacity. For the shipping industry, the lack of water translates into lost freight fees of more than $1.2 million U.S. a week.
Even if the ice storm was, in global terms, one of the lesser weather stories of the year, it was still big and expensive enough to cause a rise in Canadian insurance premiums. Still, perhaps we should count ourselves lucky: no one is yet suggesting that insurance here will become a rare and precious commodity.
Elsewhere in the world, it's a different story. The giant Munich Re insurance company issued a 1998 report suggesting that in the future, "large areas of the world, including the southeastern United States and Indonesia, may become virtually uninsurable."
Now there's a prospect for the millennium.

Record low levels have also been recorded this fall and early winter in the Great Lakes, and the flow of water through the Ottawa River is only half its usual capacity. For the shipping industry, the lack of water translates into lost freight fees of more than $1.2 million (U.S.) a week.
Even if the ice storm was, in global terms, one of the lesser weather stories of the year, it was still big and expensive enough to cause a rise in Canadian insurance premiums. Still, perhaps we should count ourselves lucky: no one is yet suggesting that insurance here will become a rare and precious commodity.
Elsewhere in the world, it's a different story. The giant Munich Re insurance company issued a 1998 report suggesting that in the future, "large areas of the world, including the southeastern United States and Indonesia, may become virtually uninsurable."
Now there's a prospect for the millennium.

Full text: OTTAWA - The January ice storm that killed more than 30 people, caused $3 billion in damage and destroyed 1,000 transmission towers was the top Canadian weather story of 1998, Environment Canada says.
The department says destructive weather has been the top newsmaker in Canada for the past three years. In 1997 the Red River flood was the top story, and in 1996 it was the Saguenay River flood.
But last year the story was about ice -- but paradoxically also about heat that washed across all of Canada, all year long.
Climatologist David Phillips, who writes the Canadian Weather Trivia Calendar each year, says the ice storm brought down enough wires to wrap around the world three times.
"What made the ice storm so unusual, though, was that it just wouldn't end," he said.
"It was such an obvious one (to win the top spot). You couldn't not pick the ice storm," he said.
The six-day storm that stretched from Georgian Bay to Nova Scotia caused 700,000 insurance claims for $1.5 billion --three times the largest amount ever paid for a natural disaster in Canada.
Governments and industry lost at least another $1.5 billion.
Here, in order, are his selections of the other nine top weather stories of 1998:
- A year-long heat wave:
"Maybe in 10 years I'll look back and say this should have been the (top) story -- if it turns out to be the start of a trend," Phillips said.
"Statistically, we should expect a year like 1998 once every 2,500 years," he said. Six months this year set individual records for warmth.
El Nino alone can't explain the heat, he said:
"The sharp increase in global temperatures in the past few years has added to the strong and compelling evidence of humankind's contribution to climate change."
- Costliest forest fire season:
By the end of October, it had cost $700 million to fight forest fires across the country -- a record amount, and about twice the normal cost for a year.
- Warmest, longest summer in memory:
It was a fabulous year for sales of lawn and garden supplies (up 63 per cent), and golf course operators were happy too. Some brewers ran short of beer bottles.
The hottest spot in Canada was the desert-like town of Osoyoos, B.C., which hit 42.8 degrees in late July.
- A near-record dry year:
For the Eastern Ontario and West Quebec area, it was the third- driest year in the 51 years since Environment Canada began keeping these records.
Levels of the Great Lakes have plummeted: Lake Ontario is down 115 centimetres (nearly four feet) since its spring peak.
Precipitation was down about five per cent nationally for the first 11 months of the year (with December's figures still to come.)
- Early planting, record harvests:
Many farmers seeded a month early, and crops were consistently two or three weeks ahead of schedule.
Canada had record harvests of corn, canola and field pease, and the second-biggest crop of soybeans ever.
- Floods in Eastern Ontario, south Quebec and the Maritimes:
Rain and tides flooded rivers in Nova Scotia in January.
In the Ottawa region the spring melt hit fast and hard, with 20- degree temperatures and strong sun flooding first the Chateauguay River, and a couple of days later the Clyde and Mississippi rivers and many lakes flooded too.
At the same time the spring heat wave flooded New Brunswick, floating away a wooden covered bridge on the Nerepis River.
- A lingering fall and reluctant winter:
"For most Canadians, the period between summer's last gasp and the first lasting snow cover is measured in weeks if not days," Phillips said.
This year winter refused to show up.
"Remarkably for Ottawa, (one) of the snowiest cities in the world, snowfall totals to Dec. 16 were just 1.6 cm, compared to a normal of 55 cm."
That's El Nino for you, he said: Even though the Pacific El Nino current stopped flowing months ago, it left behind heat stored in our country's vast water reservoirs that kept the weather from freezing.
By mid-December, just two of Ontario's 80 downhill ski resorts were open.
- Three big snowstorms:
On Feb. 25, close to 70 cm of snow and very high winds hit southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan.
Calgary had its worst blizzard in 113 years on St. Patrick's Day, with 40 to 45 cm of snow and high winds.
Saskatchewan had a Thanksgiving blizzard as well -- just 18 cm of snow, but so wet and heavy that it snapped trees and power lines.
- Hurricanes and British Columbia storms:
Three hurricanes passed through the edge of Canadian Atlantic waters --Bonnie, Danielle and Earl -- as the Atlantic had one of the worst hurricane seasons in memory.
Winds repeatedly battered the B.C. coast in November and December.
What about next year?Phillips was asked.
Look for a year that's colder than 1998, since El Nino's not flowing, he said.
"But I still think it will be warmer than normal. I think the trend will continue."

Full text: This year the weather was unforgettable. And not just in the region hit by the January ice storm; in 1998, weather issues were front-and-centre in many parts of the world.
For much of eastern Canada, it was, above all, the year of the ice. Millions of our lives were disrupted by five days of freezing rain that coated Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston, Granby and many other Quebec and Ontario communities in a layer of frigid glass. Power outages lasted more than a month in the "triangle of darkness" on Montreal's South Shore. Thirty-five people died.
The storm demanded superlatives: the most expensive weather event, the largest peacetime mobilization, the greatest number of downed trees and pylons.... It dominated daily life not only in the days of the storm but in the following weeks as well -- weeks when thousands of people were still living in shelters and when the electricity network remained as fragile as a sick child.
Could it happen again? We're not sure. But we do know enough to doubt Hydro-Quebec's assurances that the ice storm was a 1-in- 10,000-year event. The climate was never so predictable as that, not even in the good old days when it was predictable at all.
Other disasters
As the months passed and the ice-storm receded from our minds, most Canadians were slow to realize that other countries, too, were enduring weather disasters. Three countries in South America were hit by terrible flooding in April, but few of us knew about their difficulties.
It took the incredible Asian floods to bring other people's weather back to our attention. The low-lying delta nation of Bangladesh is accustomed to floods -- but not to the kind of inundation it endured in 1998. Three-quarters of the country sank under water, inflicting horrendous damage on Bangladesh's economy and its long-term prospects for development.
China's flooding was on an even more epic scale. It was a weather disaster that disrupted the lives of more than 220 million people, caused at least $30 billion US in damages, and it washed away 5.6 million homes.
Other countries in the region -- India, Nepal, Pakistan and several of the Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union -- also experienced terrible losses from the onrushing water.
But it would be a gross mistake to call these "natural disasters." The term implies some catastrophe beyond our reach or making. In truth, most of Asia's weather-related disasters were also human-related -- human-caused, even.
Take the Chinese deluge, for instance. Massive soil erosion in Sichuan province played a part in the catastrophe; so did logging and land-reclamation projects along the Yangtze River.
The Yangzte basin now has only 15 per cent of its original forest cover. Drainage of lakes and other bodies of water has enabled China to build many thousands of houses and farms; but the drainage eventually comes at a price.
For the amount of rain that fell on China last summer was high but by no means unprecedented. It was human interference in the environment that made the rainfall so devastating.
It's a similar story with the floods that assailed Nepal, northern India, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. All these areas lie in the shadow of the great Himalayan mountains, the highest in the world, and all are vulnerable to the impact of deforestation. As the mountains become increasingly denuded, they can no longer retain large quantities of snow and rain.
Fall brought no respite from the bad weather. A pair of ferocious hurricanes, Georges and Mitch, laid waste to large chunks of Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Honduras and Nicaragua.
The hurricanes, like the January ice storm, were not just natural phenomena. Their dramatic strength was a result, in part, of global climate change -- or, to use a misleading phrase, "global warming."
Why did the ice storm last so long? It wasn't just a freak of wet air. It was also the product of a strange disruption in the jetstream -- a disruption caused by El Nino, that upswelling of warm water in the Pacific that enables the tropical oceans to release a buildup of heat.
Frequency rising
Months later, Caribbean hurricanes accomplished a similar feat. And no, it's not just your imagination: there really are more of these violent storms than there used to be. The past four years, a time of the most devastating El Nino on record, have also been the most active four-year period for tropical storms since records began.
But the hurricanes, like the Asian floods, had such a terrible impact partly because of human activity. Central America has some of the highest rates of deforestation in the world. According to the Worldwatch Institute, the region is losing up to four per cent of its forest cover each year. Honduras has burned or cut down half of its trees. The steep, bare, eroding hills were unable to absorb water from the storm.
To the south, much of Brazil continued to endure a long drought. It's no no mere quirk of fate that Brazil also burned 52,000 square km of forest this year. The Amazon forests -- the lungs of the planet -- continue to turn to smoke and ash. In the absence of such forests, tropical soils quickly dry out, worsening the effects of a lack of rain.
Record losses
On a global basis, the Worldwatch Institute says, the 1980s saw total losses of $55 billion US because of weather disasters. In 1996 alone, the figure reached $60 billion -- in other words, a single year was more costly than the entire previous decade. And 1998 set a new record. This year, the first 11 months saw damage estimated at $89 billion.
In our part of the world, the year is winding down amid news of another weather-related story: water levels in the port of Montreal are at their lowest in more than 30 years. Record low levels have also been recorded this fall and early winter in the Great Lakes, and the flow of water through the Ottawa River is only half its usual capacity. For the shipping industry, the lack of water translates into lost freight fees of more than $1.2 million (U.S.) a week.
Even if the ice storm was, in global terms, one of the lesser weather stories of the year, it was still big and expensive enough to cause a rise in Canadian insurance premiums. Still, perhaps we should count ourselves lucky: no one is yet suggesting that insurance here will become a rare and precious commodity.
Elsewhere in the world, it's a different story. The giant Munich Re insurance company issued a 1998 report suggesting that in the future, "large areas of the world, including the southeastern United States and Indonesia, may become virtually uninsurable."
Now there's a prospect for the millennium.
CANADA'S TOP 10
Environment Canada climatologist David Phillips, who writes the Canadian Weather Trivia Calendar each year, says the ice storm brought down enough wires to wrap around the world three times. Here, in order, are his selections of the other nine top weather stories of '98:
A year-long heat wave:
"Statistically, we should expect a year like 1998 once every 2,500 years," Phillips said, Six months this year set individual records for heat.
Costliest forest fire season:
By the end of October, it had cost $700 million to fight forest fires across the country -- a record amount, and about twice the normal cost for a year.
Warmest, longest summer:
Sales of lawn and garden supplies were up 63 per cent, golf course operators were happy and some brewers ran short of beer bottles. The hottest spot in Canada was the town of Osoyoos, B.C., which hit 42.8 C in late July.
A near-record dry year:
For eastern Ontario and western Quebec it was the third-driest year in the 51 years since Environment Canada began keeping these records. Levels of the Great Lakes have plummeted: Lake Ontario is down 115 cm (nearly four feet) since its spring peak. Precipitation was down about five per cent nationally for the first 11 months.
Early planting, record harvests:
Many farmers seeded a month early and crops were two or three weeks ahead of schedule. Canada had record harvests of corn, canola and field peas, and the second-biggest crop of soybeans ever.
Ontario, Quebec, Maritimes floods:
Rain and tides flooded rivers in Nova Scotia in January and the spring melt hit fast and hard in the Ottawa area, where several rivers and lakes flooded. At the same time the spring heat caused the Nerepis River in New Brunswick to flood.
Alingering fall and reluctant winter:
This year winter refused to show up. "Remarkably for Ottawa, (one) of the snowiest cities in the world, snowfall totals to Dec. 16 were just 1.6 cm, compared to a normal of 55 cm." By mid- December, just two of Ontario's 80 ski resorts were open.

Female advisers to PM scarce

Abstract: On Dec. 15, [Jocelyne Bourgon] left to become president of the Canadian Centre for Management Studies, which is like saying she's decided to take a break from the political heat. Bourgon survived nearly five years, longer than most Privy Council clerks, during a tough period when the federal public service was downsized by 55,000 jobs and critics snapped at her heels. Some of her innovations were mocked, such as the "jobs fair" where deputies looked over a pool of the upwardly mobile. Her choice of a few female deputies brought disparaging references to "the sweater girls." But Bourgon evidently won the PM's confidence, sufficiently so that departments delivered what "the centre" wanted. She and chief of staff Jean Pelletier were the only two with privileged access to [Jean Chretien], who met with them first thing every morning. Last year, Bourgon survived a rough period of rumours that others in Chretien's close circle were jealous of her influence and trying to push her out. Stories went around about the PM being ticked off with bureaucrats for failing to provide the detailed analysis he needed for the Kyoto climate change negotiations, forcing him to fly by the seat of his pants. Bourgon passed on her displeasure that the system hadn't put up a red flag, which brought counter mutterings about how hard the climate scientists had been discouraged by apathy at "the centre."

Full text: OTTAWA -- Jocelyne Bourgon's decision to step down as clerk of the Privy Council means there's hardly a woman left in a position to influence Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
Not that there were ever more than a handful of women in Chretien's senior ranks. Top political and government circles are notoriously male, which, in part, explains why they are talking about subsidizing sports while denying female employees pay equity.
Chretien's appointment of Bourgon in March 1994 as the government's top bureaucrat was a breakthrough in what is generally a male-oriented club.
I also used to be able to cite Penny Collenette, who was the Liberal prime minister's director of appointments before she left to join the George Weston company as a senior executive. Collenette was a key Liberal strategist and, in the PMO, she prided herself on getting women appointed as senators. She stepped out regretting she had not succeeded in her private ambition to make a woman head of a big government business agency, such as the Atomic Energy Commission or the former crown corporation Canadian National.
Another woman on the inside was Terry O'Leary, the former chief of staff to Paul Martin. O'Leary had a fearless down-to-earth style that gave her clout not just with her boss but in the larger circle of Liberal strategists and image-makers in the PMO. She left recently to join the World Bank.
On Dec. 15, Bourgon left to become president of the Canadian Centre for Management Studies, which is like saying she's decided to take a break from the political heat. Bourgon survived nearly five years, longer than most Privy Council clerks, during a tough period when the federal public service was downsized by 55,000 jobs and critics snapped at her heels.
In the circle of power of those who work closely with the prime minister, there's only Chaviva Hosek left. Hosek co-authored the Liberal campaign platforms with Martin and now is director of policy in Chretien's office, working closely with his principal secretary Eddie Goldenberg and communications chief Peter Donolo.
She has feminist credentials as the former head of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, and won her political stripes as a former Ontario Liberal cabinet minister. Maybe Chretien feels having Hosek is sufficient profile for women in the senior ranks. By reputation, however, she's a team player and we don't know if she ever gets up on her hind legs to fight.
Bourgon reportedly took on the club. She kept pushing a program to bring new blood and a broader mix of backgrounds into senior positions. She forced deputies and assistant deputies to produce papers for the year 2005, trying to get longer-term thinking into government.
Some of her innovations were mocked, such as the "jobs fair" where deputies looked over a pool of the upwardly mobile. Her choice of a few female deputies brought disparaging references to "the sweater girls." But Bourgon evidently won the PM's confidence, sufficiently so that departments delivered what "the centre" wanted. She and chief of staff Jean Pelletier were the only two with privileged access to Chretien, who met with them first thing every morning.
Last year, Bourgon survived a rough period of rumours that others in Chretien's close circle were jealous of her influence and trying to push her out. Stories went around about the PM being ticked off with bureaucrats for failing to provide the detailed analysis he needed for the Kyoto climate change negotiations, forcing him to fly by the seat of his pants. Bourgon passed on her displeasure that the system hadn't put up a red flag, which brought counter mutterings about how hard the climate scientists had been discouraged by apathy at "the centre."
More recently, there's been a lot of internal fuss about leaks of government secrets to the media and criticism of Bourgon's failure to turn off the tap. Since the leaks are obviously either deliberate or come from restless backbenchers, it's not clear any bureaucrat could stop them.
During her tenure, Bourgon had an important influence over a popular and, so far, successful government. She left when she chose to do so, rather than when she was being pushed. She's being replaced by Mel Cappe, the deputy in human resources.
Cappe recently proved his value to his masters by talking the Employment Insurance commissioners into recommending minor, rather than major, reductions in EI premiums. He thus defused a potential confrontation between the commissioners and Martin, who would have fought major EI premium reductions.
Cappe isn't expected to make waves, as Bourgon did, which had both its ups and downs. She hated being judged as the first woman to be privy clerk, insisting competence was the only issue. She won't like me saying her departure sharply reduces the female influence around Chretien. But it's a fact.

Abstract: Climatologist David Phillips, who writes the Canadian Weather Trivia Calendar each year, says the ice storm brought down enough wires to wrap around the world three times. The six-day storm that stretched from Georgian Bay to Nova Scotia sparked 700,000 insurance claims for $1.5 billion -- three times the largest amount ever paid for a natural disaster in Canada. Governments and industry lost at least another $1.5 billion. Phillips predicts 1999 will be colder than this year because El Nino is no longer a factor.

Full text: OTTAWA -- Environment Canada says destructive weather has been the top newsmaker in Canada for the past three years, and cites January's ice storm as the most crucial Canadian weather story of 1998.
Last year, the Red River flood was the top story. In 1996, the Saguenay River flood.
This year's ice storm killed more than 30 people, caused $3 billion in damage and destroyed 1,000 transmission towers.
Climatologist David Phillips, who writes the Canadian Weather Trivia Calendar each year, says the ice storm brought down enough wires to wrap around the world three times.
"What made the ice storm so unusual, though, was that it just wouldn't end," said Phillips, who decided this year's top weather stories.
The six-day storm that stretched from Georgian Bay to Nova Scotia sparked 700,000 insurance claims for $1.5 billion -- three times the largest amount ever paid for a natural disaster in Canada. Governments and industry lost at least another $1.5 billion.
Although 1998's top story was about ice, record heat washed across Canada all year long.
"Maybe in 10 years I'll look back and say this should have been the (top) story, if it turns out to be the start of a trend," Phillips said. "Statistically, we should expect a year like 1998 once every 2,500 years," he said.
Six months of this year set individual records for warmth, and El Nino alone can't explain the heat.
"The sharp increase in global temperatures in the past few years has added to the strong and compelling evidence of humankind's contribution to climate change," Phillips said.
Even though the Pacific El Nino current stopped flowing months ago, it left behind heat stored in our country's vast water reservoirs that kept the weather warmer than normal.
Phillips predicts 1999 will be colder than this year because El Nino is no longer a factor.
"But I still think it will be warmer than normal. I think the trend will continue."

Abstract: Eastern Ontario wins the prize for the worst weather in the country this year -- from ice storm to floods to drought and a delayed winter. "Remarkably for Ottawa, (one) of the snowiest cities in the world, snowfall totals to Dec. 16 were just 1.6 centimetres, compared to a normal of 55 centimetres." Calgary had its worst blizzard in 113 years on St. Patrick's Day, with 40 to 45 centimetres of snow and high winds.

Full text: Eastern Ontario wins the prize for the worst weather in the country this year -- from ice storm to floods to drought and a delayed winter.
The ice storm that killed more than 30 people, caused $3 billion in damage and destroyed 1,000 transmission towers was the top Canadian weather story of 1998, Environment Canada says.
And three others in the top 10 also hit Eastern Ontario -- floods in March and April, dry conditions that left Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River with low water levels, and a slow start to ski season.
The department says destructive weather has been the top newsmaker in Canada for the past three years. In 1997 the Red River flood was the top story, and in 1996 it was the Saguenay River flood.
This year the story was about ice -- but paradoxically, also about heat that washed across all of Canada, all year long.
Climatologist David Phillips, who writes the Canadian Weather Trivia Calendar each year, says the ice storm brought down enough wires to wrap around the world three times.
"What made the ice storm so unusual, though, was that it just wouldn't end," he said. "It was such an obvious one (to win the top spot). You couldn't not pick the ice storm," he said.
The storm that covered area from Georgian Bay to Nova Scotia led to 700,000 insurance claims for $1.5 billion -- three times the previous largest amount paid for a natural disaster in Canada. Governments and industry lost at least another $1.5 billion.
Here, in order, are Mr. Phillips's selections of the other nine top weather stories of 1998: (2) A year-long heat wave
"Maybe in 10 years I'll look back and say this should have been the (top) story -- if it turns out to be the start of a trend," Mr. Phillips said.
"Statistically, we should expect a year like 1998 once every 2,500 years," he said. Six months this year set individual records for warmth.
El Nino alone can't explain the heat, he said: "The sharp increase in global temperatures in the past few years has added to the strong and compelling evidence of humankind's contribution to climate change."
(3) Costliest forest fire season
By the end of October, it had cost $700 million to fight forest fires across the country -- a record amount, and about twice the normal cost for a year.
(4) Warmest, longest summer in memory
It was a fabulous year for sales of lawn and garden supplies (up 63 per cent), and golf course operators were happy too. Some brewers ran short of beer bottles.
The hottest spot in Canada was the desert-like town of Osoyoos, B.C., which hit 42.8 degrees in late July.
(5) A near-record dry year
For the Eastern Ontario and West Quebec area, it was the third- driest year in the 51 years since Environment Canada began keeping such records.
Levels of the Great Lakes have plummeted: Lake Ontario is down 115 centimetres since its spring peak.
Precipitation was down about five per cent nationally for the first 11 months of the year (with December's figures still to come.)
(6) Early planting, record harvests Many farmers seeded a month early, and crops were consistently two or three weeks ahead of schedule. Canada had record harvests of corn, canola and field pease, and the second-biggest crop of soybeans ever.
(7) Floods in Eastern Ontario, south Quebec, the Maritimes
Rain and tides flooded rivers in Nova Scotia in January.
In our own region, the spring melt hit fast and hard, with 20- degree temperatures and strong sun flooding first the Chateauguay River, and a couple of days later the Clyde and Mississippi Rivers and many lakes flooded too.
At the same time the spring heat wave flooded New Brunswick, floating away a wooden covered bridge on the Nerepis River.
(8) A lingering fall and reluctant winter
"For most Canadians, the period between summer's last gasp and the first lasting snow cover is measured in weeks if not days," Mr. Phillips said.
This year winter refused to show up.
"Remarkably for Ottawa, (one) of the snowiest cities in the world, snowfall totals to Dec. 16 were just 1.6 centimetres, compared to a normal of 55 centimetres."
That's El Nino for you, he said: Even though the Pacific El Nino current stopped flowing months ago, it left behind heat stored in our country's vast water reservoirs that kept the weather from freezing.
By mid-December, just two of Ontario's 80 downhill ski resorts were open.
(9) Three big snowstorms
On Feb. 25, close to 70 centimetres of snow and very high winds hit southern Manitoba and saskatchewan.
Calgary had its worst blizzard in 113 years on St. Patrick's Day, with 40 to 45 centimetres of snow and high winds.
Saskatchewan had a Thanksgiving blizzard as well -- just 18 centimetres of snow, but so wet and heavy that it snapped trees and power lines.
(10) Hurricanes and British Columbia storms
Three hurricanes passed through the edge of Canadian Atlantic waters -- Bonnie, Danielle and Earl -- as the Atlantic had one of the worst hurricane seasons in memory.
Winds repeatedly battered the B.C. coast in November and December.
What about next year? Mr. Phillips was asked.
Look for a year that's colder than 1998, since El Nino's not flowing, he said.
"But I still think it will be warmer than normal. I think the trend will continue."

Full text: Quintessential public servant new Clerk of the Privy Council
'I think he'll challenge people more than his predecessor (Bourgon), and bring more rigour to the policy process.'Norman Spector
Former privy council clerk
'The Prime Minister likes people who kind of wear their hearts on their sleeve, who aren't afraid to fight for a point of view.'Peter Donolo
Jean Chretien's communications director
OTTAWA BUREAU
OTTAWA - There's no glass ceiling above Mel Cappe's head. Good thing.
The man just named Clerk of the Privy Council Office - Canada's top public servant - is prone to flinging nicely sharpened pencils or his teak letter opener upward in moments of impatience or excitement.
There, the pointy instruments sit embedded in a soft rectangular ceiling tile that's slung by chains over his desk. It's apparently Cappe's version of rubbing his shoulders, or a quick stretch of the legs.
"This is an introduction to Mel Cappe that's extremely sobering when a young bureaucrat walks in and has his first meeting with him," says Pollution Probe's Rick Findlay, who once worked under Cappe, then deputy environment minister.
Findlay was the department's climate change adviser, and quickly came to know Cappe as an astute manager who early on recognized the political implications of the global warming issue, and made it a priority within the department. Soon, the bizarre sight of the ceiling tile stabbed with pencils simply suited the boss.
"He probably knows he has a volatile and expressive kind of personality," says Findlay. "And he doesn't care, he doesn't hide it and actually sort of makes fun of it."
The humorous, energetic, demonstrative side of Mel Cappe - the opposite of what you might expect in a top-flight bureaucrat - may in fact be what clinched him the job.
Cappe is succeeding Jocelyne Bourgon, the first woman in the job. The Prime Minister's Office calls them both "historic" appointments.
More important, the chemistry between Chretien and Cappe is good. They had lunch on Cappe's 50th birthday on Dec. 3. A week later, Chretien offered him the job.
"The Prime Minister likes people who kind of wear their hearts on their sleeve, who aren't afraid to fight for a point of view," says Peter Donolo, Chretien's communications director and a trusted adviser. "He's also been around government long enough to know that sometimes impatience can be the difference between getting something done and getting nothing."
In his 23 years in the public service, in five different departments, Cappe has become adept at getting things done, all the while keeping a very low public profile.
Born in Toronto, Cappe grew up in the Sheppard Ave. W. and Bathurst St. area. He trained as an economist at the University of Toronto and the University of Western Ontario, and had nearly completed a doctorate in economics when he took up a junior position in Ottawa at Treasury Board in 1975. The minister: Jean Chretien, then president of Treasury Board.
Chretien doesn't remember Cappe from those days, but he does remember Cappe standing out as deputy minister at environment and later at human resources and development.
That's because Cappe, who failed Grade 12 French but picked it up over his career, successfully waded through environmental harmonization talks with the provinces, negotiated the transfer of labour market training to Quebec, helped design the National Child Benefit, and oversaw the Employment Insurance fund surplus.
"He's certainly very sensitive to the kinds of concerns we have dealing with other levels of government," says Donolo.
"He's a good sort of can-do kind of person," says Ian Clark, Cappe's former boss at consumer and corporate affairs, and later at Treasury Board, now head of the Council of Ontario Universities. The senior lawyers and accountants "felt they could work with him and they respected him and that was very impressive to me."
Mel Cappe, by all accounts, doesn't fear give-and-take, but he is also a keen listener with an ability to pick up on the contributions of others in a meeting, to "read a room," says one who knows him, and acknowledge people's input.
It's a trait that has engendered loyalty and respect among those who worked for him, with him and above him.
And it's one that no doubt will serve Cappe well as he heads up the group of deputy and assistant deputy ministers that make up the top echelons of the public service, a high-octane mix of talents and egos if ever there was one.
"It's just like a cabinet - they all think they can be prime minister," says Norman Spector, a former privy council clerk under prime minister Brian Mulroney.
Cappe's biggest challenge, says Spector, is "to establish his imprimatur" on that group, and run an effective governing operation that could potentially span the terms of two prime ministers if Chretien steps down.
Spector says Cappe "has always been in the top 5 per cent in terms of policy strengths.
"I think he'll challenge people more than his predecessor (Bourgon), and bring more rigour to the policy process. Those presenting policy to cabinet will have a much more stringent test to pass."
Cappe, 50, is the father of two grown children, fit (he's an avid cross-country skier) and certainly entering the prime of his public service career.
Contacted by journalists, his friends bristled at the word "bureaucrat" to describe Cappe.
Instead, they called him a quintessential public servant, dedicated to coming up with sound policies and delivering quality services to Canadians.
But one suspects the frank, outspoken Cappe, behind his closed doors, doesn't quibble with the description, and rather relishes it.

Thin ranks of PM's female aides now thinner: [1 Edition]

Full text: OTTAWA
JOCELYNE BOURGON'S decision to step down as clerk of the Privy Council means there's hardly a woman left in a position to influence Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
Not that there were ever more than a handful of women in Chretien's senior ranks. Top political and government circles are notoriously male, which, in part, explains why they are talking about subsidizing sports while denying female employees pay equity.
Chretien's appointment of Bourgon in March, 1994 as the government's top bureaucrat was a breakthrough in what is generally a male-oriented club.
I also used to be able to cite Penny Collenette, who was the Liberal prime minister's director of appointments before she left to join the George Weston company as a senior executive. Collenette was a key Liberal strategist, and in the PMO she prided herself on getting women appointed as senators. She stepped out regretting she had not succeeded in her private ambition to make a woman head of a big government business agency, like the Atomic Energy Commission or the former crown corporation Canadian National.
Another woman on the inside was Terry O'Leary, the former chief of staff to Paul Martin. O'Leary had a fearless down-to-earth style that gave her clout not just with her boss but in the larger circle of Liberal strategists and image-makers in the PMO. She left recently to join the World Bank.
On Tuesday, Bourgon left to become president of the Canadian Centre for Management Studies, which is like saying she's decided to take a break from the political heat. Bourgon survived nearly five years, longer than most Privy Council clerks, during a tough period when the federal public service was downsized by 55,000 jobs, and critics snapped at her heels.
In the circle of power of those who work closely with the prime minister, there's only Chaviva Hosek left. Hosek co-authored the Liberal campaign platforms with Martin and now is director of policy in Chretien's office, working closely with his principal secretary Eddie Goldenberg and communications chief Peter Donolo. She has feminist credentials as the former head of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, and won her political stripes as a former Ontario Liberal cabinet minister. Maybe Chretien feels having Hosek is sufficient profile for women in the senior ranks. By reputation, however, she's a team player, and we don't know if she ever gets up on her hind legs to fight.
Bourgon reportedly took on the club. She kept pushing a program to bring new blood and a broader mix of backgrounds into senior positions. She forced deputies and assistant deputies to produce papers for the year 2005, trying to get longer-term thinking into government.
Some of her innovations were mocked, such as the "jobs fair" where deputies looked over a pool of the upwardly mobile. Her choice of a few female deputies brought disparaging references to "the sweater girls." But Bourgon evidently won the PM's confidence, sufficiently so that departments delivered what "the centre" wanted. She and chief of staff Jean Pelletier were the only two with privileged access to Chretien, who met with them first thing every morning.
Last year, Bourgon survived a rough period of rumours that others in Chretien's close circle were jealous of her influence and trying to push her out. Stories went around about the PM being ticked off with bureaucrats for failing to provide the detailed analysis he needed for the Kyoto climate change negotiations, forcing him to fly by the seat of his pants. Bourgon passed on her displeasure that the system hadn't put up a red flag, which brought counter mutterings about how hard the climate scientists had been discouraged by apathy at "the centre."
More recently, there's been a lot of internal fuss about leaks of government secrets to the media, and criticism of Bourgon's failure to turn off the tap. Since the leaks are obviously either deliberate, or come from restless backbenchers, it's not clear any bureaucrat could stop them.
During her tenure, Bourgon had an important influence over a popular and, so far, successful government, and left this week when she chose to do so, rather than when she was being pushed. She's being replaced by Mel Cappe, the deputy in human resources.
Cappe recently proved his value to his masters by talking the Employment Insurance commissioners into recommending minor, rather than major, reductions in EI premiums. He thus defused a potential confrontation between the commissioners and Martin, who would have fought major EI premium reductions.
Cappe isn't expected to make waves, as Bourgon did, which had both its ups and downs. She hated being judged as the first woman to be privy clerk, insisting competency was the only issue. She won't like me saying her departure sharply reduces the female influence around Chretien. But it's a fact.
Rosemary Speirs, The Star's national affairs columnist, usually writes Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

Abstract: I read with great interest your Dec. 4 editorial about cosmetic surgery performed in the office setting (here in Florida). As an anesthetist who specializes in these procedures and as a member of the Florida Association of Nurse Anesthetists ad hoc committee on office surgery, I have some very definite opinions on this matter. If you look more closely at the Sun-Sentinel articles {about 13 plastic-surgery deaths in Florida) and possibly even go back through their archives you will find one particular physician who has influenced the current Board of Medicine's thinking. This particular physician already had at least three lawsuits settled against him; $5,000 fines and a ceremonial slap on the wrist did nothing to prevent him from finally killing a patient. The current trend to regulate and certify the facilities and the physicians will only add bureaucratic red tape and costs to an already expensive event for the patient. What's more, the current Board of Medicine's Surgical Care Committee is made up of physicians who have never performed or witnessed an office surgery procedure. I find this unusual.

Regarding "Cosmetic surgery's ugly side":
I read with great interest your Dec. 4 editorial about cosmetic surgery performed in the office setting (here in Florida). As an anesthetist who specializes in these procedures and as a member of the Florida Association of Nurse Anesthetists ad hoc committee on office surgery, I have some very definite opinions on this matter.
First regulating the already prudent and conscientious provider will do nothing to improve their care; they are already doing a fine job.
Second, regulations will add a new cost to certify the facility the physician uses (his office surgery suite).
Third, regulations will not eliminate the poor practitioners because there is already a mechanism in place to deal with them and that is the Board of Medicine.
If you look more closely at the Sun-Sentinel articles {about 13 plastic-surgery deaths in Florida) and possibly even go back through their archives you will find one particular physician who has influenced the current Board of Medicine's thinking. This particular physician already had at least three lawsuits settled against him; $5,000 fines and a ceremonial slap on the wrist did nothing to prevent him from finally killing a patient.
I applaud the Board of Medicine and its efforts to improve the quality of care and safety in the office surgery setting, but I think the real focus is on the practitioner and the prompt removal of medical licenses for poor and sub-standard practitioners.
The current trend to regulate and certify the facilities and the physicians will only add bureaucratic red tape and costs to an already expensive event for the patient. What's more, the current Board of Medicine's Surgical Care Committee is made up of physicians who have never performed or witnessed an office surgery procedure. I find this unusual.

Pap smear deal upsetting
I was pleased to read of the new, highly improved Pap smear that could save thousands of lives, but very upset to read that most insurance companies do not want to pay the extra $20-or-so, once-a- year cost. They do, however pay men for four to eight Viagra pills, at $10 a pill, every month.
I guess that tells women just how important they are in today's society.

Florida's coastal future at risk
The United States completed another round of international global warming negotiations in Buenos Aires, Argentina. By signing the Kyoto Protocol, the United States showed that it takes the threat of global warming seriously. However, if we do not begin to cut our emissions of greenhouse gases, this move will be nothing more than a symbolic gesture.
The United States is the world's leading producer of greenhouse gases - emitting one quarter of the world's greenhouse gas pollution with only 4 percent of the population.
The oil companies have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to create the illusion that there is no scientific consensus concerning global warming.
To counteract such intentional confusion-making, 2,500 scientists met in 1995 at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and produced a clear consensus that global warming represents a serious threat to our future. The greenhouse effect is going to increase the number of hurricanes and their intensity and cause a sea level rise from 2 to 6 feet in our children's and grandchildren's lifetimes. Climate zones are going to shift so quickly that the forests on the U.S.'s east coast may suffer major die-back, possibly converting to grasslands.
It's not alarmist environmentalists saying such things, but the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. Florida is at great risk from sea level rise and increased storms. We can live comfortably with radically less energy use. We must wake up.

Education's shortcomings can be pinpointed
Seldom does a day go by without some news on schools and schooling. Just recently, bad news: The U.S. graduation rates are slipping badly, relative to the rest of the industrial world.
A chief cause of our educational woes is underpaying teachers. Most countries pay their teachers much better than we pay ours. And, we pay our teachers much less than we did, say, 30 years ago relative to other professionals.
American society has always had a strong anti-intellectual streak and I think this is partly manifested in neglect of education. The method of school support, property taxes, is open to challenge even if it would be very hard to change. Adding lottery money to state education was a double joke: Lottery money just replaces funds, rather than augmenting them, and gambling puts the state in a business of questionable morality.
Yet all the money in the world may not help education goals if the goals or methods are flawed. Treating school as "job preparation" is a narrow goal. Another problem is reliance on behavioral psychology and classroom management (training kids to work for everything, from gold stars to candy treats, rather than to understand or appreciate). Children are young minds to enlighten, not animals like B.F. Skinner's rats and pigeons. Another problem I see is uncritical acceptance of the role and value of computers, the darlings of the moment.
The local school system is mired in dispute. The entire national system, with modestly paid community representatives directing highly educated professionals seems flawed. Tempers flare as teachers think about the high pay of administrators.
Misbehavior problems dog our schools, with only the most extreme actions catching the public eye. Federal laws and regulations require intense education of various "challenged" groups, straining the "greatest good for the greatest number" concept.
Wake up! The schools' figurative frog is being fried on the low, slow burner of public apathy.

Blame SMH bosses for mess
In a recent Herald-Tribune editorial you indicated that you were not sure how much responsibility the administration and hospital board had in the poor financial condition of Sarasota Memorial Hospital.
Let me see if I can help. The administration, with the oversite of the board, runs the hospital. One cannot blame Medicare or anyone else, because the changes in Medicare benefits as well as other insurance companies have been happening for a long time now. The changes have been in all the newspapers.
If the administration was as good as the board and you seem to think they are, it would have anticipated these changes. Then SMH would have streamlined operating costs so as to cover its expenses with the reduced income, while at the same time making hospital services affordable to more people. This is what good administrators do.
But instead of lowering operating costs, SMH administrators, along with our rubber-stamp board, saw fit to expand the facilities and buy more real estate than is needed, while leasing 60,000 square feet of space miles away from the hospital to this administrative staff.
These are not responsible actions. We need a change . . . a confrontational board. That is what an oversite board does: confront and question. It's their job. After all, it's the community's money.
The Herald-Tribune might see these things more clearly if the hospital did not spend many thousands of dollar per year on unnecessary advertising.
Yes, it is time for a change before it's too late. . .

Do explorations on the moon instead of in a space station
The International Space Station is a wasteful, NASA-sponsored, billion-dollar public relations boondoggle that will accomplish little from a scientific standpoint. This nation became great from its exploration projects, both internal and external, and we should continue on that path. There is little exploration that can be done in orbit. The space station's foreign sponsors cannot afford the costs, and since we will wind up paying for most of it ourselves anyway, why not do it right?
Those billions would be better spent in reviving the Apollo moon exploration program that was stopped in the 1970s because of Lyndon Johnson's scientific ignorance and the mounting costs of the Vietnam War. Instead of building the space station, we should use its elements to construct a permanent base - on the moon - for research and exploration. If the hardware can be used in orbit, it can be used on the moon, with the added advantage of light gravity for its occupants as they work. Retro rockets can be easily designed to land the equipment there. All the necessary hardware was engineered and built years ago for the Apollo program. Some is still in storage - Saturn rockets, moon landers, crew living modules, laboratories, moon vehicles, etc.
I would guess that the costs would be less than constructing and maintaining a useless orbiting space station, and the benefits from discoveries of mineral resources, etc., on the moon would be of inestimable commercial and scientific value.
A further benefit would be the long-term revival of our aerospace industry with its associated engineering researchers.
The space station is being called a stepping-stone for a return to the moon. What a waste when we could go there directly.

Ex-Turtle Rock building inspector a scapegoat
I would like to commend the Herald-Tribune staff for the well- balanced articles on the violations found in the Turtle Rock homes of the Palmer Ranch development in Sarasota County. Following this saga from the beginning, I have concluded that the county made a scapegoat out of one inspector, and that this was done mainly for the purpose of avoiding litigation.
The right thing to do would have been to give this inspector a review by his peers, not his director, who may be protecting his position, and not the county commissioners, who probably do not know the difference between a hurricane strap and a regular tie-down.
The public should consider that this inspector was at the bottom of the food chain for money and position, and for this he didn't have a chance. What about all the individuals up the chain; do not they bear some responsibility?
The public should also ask, if the inspector has a workload of between 16 and 20 inspections in an eighthour day, and has to do paperwork before he starts and after he finishes and in between travels to each site, how does he have time to review plans and to keep up with a crew of tradesmen at the construction site?
As the inspector stated, if he had insisted on pulling off any covering plywood to inspect what was behind it, he would have been fired by the county for slowing down construction. So this was a no- win situation.
I would ask his fellow inspectors to stand up and be counted, and also the public to demand reinstatement for this inspector.

Dr. Jack Kevorkian may be another era's Margaret Sanger
In 1916, Margaret Sanger and her sister, Ethel Higgins, opened the nation's first birth-control clinic. People were outraged. The use of contraceptives was considered immoral by all major religions. Sanger and Higgins each received 30-day jail sentences. But Sanger persevered and, thanks to her; Planned Parenthood, which she founded; and the U.S. Supreme Court, millions of American women now use contraceptives routinely.
We have with us today another Sanger, in the person of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. His crusade for death with dignity will eventually prevail because of its moral rightness. He will be looked upon with respect in the 21st century, as Sanger is in the 20th.
Dr. Kervorkian offends many people because his moral beliefs differ from theirs, but so have others throughout history with a new idea, whether it be religious, political, economic or social.
Those who oppose Dr. Kervorkian talk about the sanctity of human life. Who can be against that? But his efforts have nothing whatsoever to do with human life: the terminally ill have already lived their lives in full. The issue is whether or not to prolong dying.
Some say pain can be relieved with medication, but this has little value to someone left drowsy, semi-conscious, or suffering discomfort. Some say if doctor-assisted suicide is allowed, very quickly everyone inconvenient to have around will be pushed into suicide. No. If we can send criminals to jail, with laws to protect the innocent, we can prevent abuse of doctor-assisted suicide.
When the terminally ill are suffering pain and discomfort, when they are rapidly going through life savings that they want to pass on to their heirs, when quality of life is no longer there, they have a right to decide for themselves when and how to die. Someone else's moral beliefs should not be imposed upon them.

Christmas lights don't show up
The drive up Main Street could be a festive holiday sight with beautiful light decorations on the lampposts. Unfortunately, since the lights are hung incorrectly, the effect is lost. All of the lights are turned to be parallel to the street. You can only see the lights if directly in front of them. If they were turned perpendicular to the street and buildings, the effect would be much nicer: the designs would be visible all the way up and down the street. Maybe someone could remember for next year.

SCHOOL VOUCHERS
System unfair without them
To all those public school bureaucrats and teacher union members who say vouchers will be unfair because they will take away funds from public schools, I say instead that it is our current system which is indeed very unfair to all those parents who feel public education is so bad that they are forced to send their children to private schools and have to pay twice for their children's schooling.
In addition to expensive private school tuition, they are still obliged by government to give money, through taxes, to public schools, although they receive no services from them. I think they deserve the tax relief vouchers will provide. The public school bureaucracy has been unfairly receiving a free gift from those parents. The voucher system will right this wrong.
Also, if public schools will receive in the future less funds with the voucher system, they will indeed need less funds when the number of pupils they have to teach will decrease by the amount of children switching to private schools.
With the school tax voucher system, public schools and private schools will each get paid for only those children they actually teach. What is so unfair about that?
I say bring the voucher system to Florida and enable children to get a better education. Private schools do a better job with less money. I personally feel that maybe it is about time public schools felt a little threatened by competition so they might improve, cut waste and be forced into learning what fiscal discipline is.

Wisconsin effort failed
I believe it is time to take a serious look at school vouchers.
Vouchers represent the use of public funds to send students to other K-12 public or private and even sometimes religious schools.
Our newly elected governor and lieutenant governor have indicated a desire to experiment with school vouchers.
Is this really necessary when we have the experience of the state of Wisconsin?
Back in June, the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued a 4-2 decision upholding the expansion of Milwaukee's tax-funded school voucher program to include religious schools. The People for the American Way prepared an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on First Amendment grounds.
Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court refused the case and said it was a state matter. The Wisconsin ruling is compelling evidence that the separation of church and state is dangerously close to being weakened dramatically in this country.
Every child in this country counts: 89 percent of American children are in our public schools. Only a few can receive vouchers.
Whose choice is it really? Private schools retain the right to select and reject students at will.
There are plenty of fly-by-night schools. Experience with Milwaukee and Cleveland schools showed that most children wound up in a new school with no track record. Several such schools in Milwaukee collapsed under fraud and mismanagement.
A voucher is unlikely to cover many hidden costs such as transportation, books and uniforms. In Cleveland, this "oversight" cost the state millions in taxes.
Vouchers have no provided public accountability in standards for private school curriculum content, achievement measures, teacher certification and instructional materials. Where are the standards for transportation, class size, administration, attendance, expulsion or disciplinary practices?
There is also no evidence that private or religious schools do a better job. Even in Milwaukee, researchers concluded that there is no evidence that choice students do either better or worse than public school students once we have controls for gender, race, income, grade and prior achievement.
Do we really need to experiment with vouchers in Florida?
I think not!

Full text:   SUNSEEKERS could one day shun the glamour of the Riviera for Blackpool, Skegness and Cleethorpes.
As the world heats up over the next 50 years, Mediterranean resorts will become unbearably hot, a study said yesterday.
Instead, holidaymakers in search of sun and sand will flock to Britain's neglected seaside towns. The prediction comes from a major report into the impact of climate change on the way we work and play.
As well as boosting tourism, hotter summers should see the arrival of Mediterranean cafe culture in Britain.
However, global warming will also bring unpredictable weather, floods and droughts.
Government scientists say UK temperatures will rise by up to 3c in 100 years. Some of the rise will be the result of climate changes, but most will be from greenhouse gas pollution.
Summers are set to be hotter and winters stormy. Tornadoes, floods and hurricanes will be more common.
According to the North-West Climate Change Impacts Study published yesterday, hot summers will change working patterns. Productivity in factories and offices could slump as workers struggle to stay cool.
Report spokesman Steve Connor said: '50 years from now we will have to start thinking about more Mediterranean styles of working. That could mean an early start for many at 7am and a long break in the afternoon or a siesta after lunch.' Researchers talked to hundreds of companies and individuals to find out how climate change will hit them.
They found that insurance premiums are likely to soar. Flooding alone is likely to put GBP 1billion worth of homes, factories, offices and possessions at risk.
Strong winds are more likely at sea and ships will have to be given more powerful engines to cope.
But global warming will have some benefits.
Milder winters could save thousands of the elderly from dying.
Results of the study were published at a Manchester conference on climate change.

Full text: DOMESTIC and commercial insurance claims will soar further if changing world weather patterns continue, a seminar in Edinburgh will hear tomorrow.
Mr David Crichton, environmental issues manager for Commercial and General Union, is also due to tell delegates at the Building Research Establishment (BRE) talks that insurers may have to stop providing building cover in certain circumstances.
Environmental campaigners warned that a huge leap in premiums was just one possible effect of climate change.
Mr Crichton says construction methods must change urgently if buildings are to withstand the effects of more severe weather conditions.
The conference has been organised by the BRE, which is part-funded by the Government, to discuss the effects of climate change on buildings and those who live and work in them.
Other speakers, including researchers from the BRE laboratory in East Kilbride, will warn of the possible damage to buildings by storms, floods, and droughts.
They will also outline the health risks from unsuitable homes and workplaces, including the possibility of more deaths from heart attacks in rising summer temperatures.
Mr Crichton will look at the implications of climate change for insurers, whom he describes as "very concerned" at the mounting level of claims.
He will say: "Worldwide economic losses from natural catastrophes have soared in the last decade. This is a trend which is not going to reduce, and climate change will inevitably accelerate it."
He will explain that UK insurers have dealt in the last 11 years with the century's three most costly storms. He also points to "enormous increases'' in subsidence claims, largely because of droughts.
He describes a major coastal flood as "the worst case scenario for insurers" and says efforts have been made to discourage developments in vulnerable areas.
He will add: "There may come a time when the insurance industry will no longer be able to provide insurance cover for domestic residences built in floodplains against the advice of the Environment Agency (in England and Wales) or the Scottish Environment Protection Agency."
Mr Crichton will urge the building industry to adapt to the threat by improving construction.
He will tell delegates: "Insurers are working very hard to understand the hazard. We are increasingly involved with research into all aspects of climate change impacts, and how we can help mitigate the economic losses which will inevitably follow.
"We welcome the plans of the UK Government to control greenhouse gas emissions as outlined in (Deputy Prime Minister) John Prescott's recent consultation paper.
"The problem is that, even if the rest of the world were to act as firmly, we shall still be facing increasingly frequent and severe storms, floods, and droughts in the UK for the next 100 years.
"The effects of climate change will be gradually increasing and, if buildings constructed now are to last well into the next century, construction methods will have to change now."
A Scottish Office sponsored report last month predicted that temperatures in Scotland may rise by as much as 2.6C by 2080, with 17% more rainfall over the same period. By 2050, sea levels around Scotland could have risen by up to 69cm.
Plant and wildlife habitats could shift northwards by up to 50 miles a decade, threatening rare alpine species, it said.
The report highlighted the dangers to the Scottish economy, warning of reduction of salmon stocks because of warmer waters and a decline in the winter sports industry due to a lack of snow.
It calculated that the cost of flood damage could increase six- fold to #60m over the next 50 years.
A spokesman for Friends of the Earth said yesterday: "More severe weather conditions would lead to more damage to properties and, in turn, premiums would inevitably rise."
He added that buildings would also have to be more energy efficient to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.

Waiting-list study long overdue

Abstract: We've had task forces, commissions and consultants looking into constitutional amendments (two), Crown corporations, the prosecutions department, serious crime prevention, electoral boundaries, government accounting procedures, government communications staffing, municipal governance, property tax assessment, MLA salaries, judges' salaries, farm safety net programs, wildlife crop damage, co-operatives, northern development, uranium mining, nuclear energy, climate change, forestry practices, human rights code amendments, community home operators, computerized health data, drug costs, health care unions, family-friendly workplaces, minimum wage rates, occupational health and safety standards, the workers compensation system, utility rate hikes (five), no-fault insurance, regulations for young drivers, the university system, SIAST, regional colleges, private vocational schools and casino development. Steven Lewis, the new chair of the health utilization commission, says there are no reliable data on waiting lists. "We just don't have the indicators," he said in a recent SP interview. "It's tough to compare waiting lists from Saskatoon and Regina. Absent those indicators and measures, it becomes a debate based on anecdote, squeaky wheels and strategic arguments." Until this week, the closest the NDP came to a study into waiting lists was in the spring of 1997, when former health minister Eric Cline announced the formation of a quality-of-care committee. This committee of doctors, nurses and other health professionals was going to look into things such as bed closures, waiting lists and nurse-to-patient ratios to see if any problems existed.

Full text: Talk about a long waiting list.
Since taking office seven years ago, the Romanow administration has conducted a study into nearly every aspect of government policy.
We've had task forces, commissions and consultants looking into constitutional amendments (two), Crown corporations, the prosecutions department, serious crime prevention, electoral boundaries, government accounting procedures, government communications staffing, municipal governance, property tax assessment, MLA salaries, judges' salaries, farm safety net programs, wildlife crop damage, co-operatives, northern development, uranium mining, nuclear energy, climate change, forestry practices, human rights code amendments, community home operators, computerized health data, drug costs, health care unions, family-friendly workplaces, minimum wage rates, occupational health and safety standards, the workers compensation system, utility rate hikes (five), no-fault insurance, regulations for young drivers, the university system, SIAST, regional colleges, private vocational schools and casino development.
These are just some of the external reports dropped on my desk over the years. The list doesn't include internal government studies, some of which have been released publicly and some of which we'll never know about.
Nor does this list include numerous studies conducted by the government-appointed Health Services Utilization and Research Commission. Over the years, the commission has looked into the home- care system, emergency room utilization, the use of chest x-rays, the use of maternity ultrasounds and the overuse of screening procedures for certain medical conditions.
There were perfectly legitimate reasons for conducting each and every one of the aforementioned studies.
But while all these other studies went ahead, the issue of surgical waiting lists languished on the NDP government's own seven- year waiting list.
Anyone who has endured a three-week wait to have a cancerous tumour removed, a six-month delay in getting a hip replacement or a year-long wait for gynecological surgery would probably classify the waiting list issue as a problem that should go straight to the head of the line.
But for some unknown reason, the government decided a study into waiting lists was an elective procedure.
It's not that the issue hasn't come to the government's attention. Patients, doctors and the province's two opposition parties have been harping at it for years to do something about the situation.
And for the past eight years, the Fraser Institute has issued an annual report on surgical waiting lists which never fails to catch the government's attention. This year's report said Saskatchewan patients wait an average of 17 weeks from the time they see their general practitioner until they get in for surgery, the longest such delay in the country.
And it's not that the government claimed to have all the answers. Quite the contrary.
While the government disputes the Fraser Institute survey, no one seems to know what the real numbers are.
Steven Lewis, the new chair of the health utilization commission, says there are no reliable data on waiting lists. "We just don't have the indicators," he said in a recent SP interview. "It's tough to compare waiting lists from Saskatoon and Regina. Absent those indicators and measures, it becomes a debate based on anecdote, squeaky wheels and strategic arguments."
The government also admits it has no way to know whether surgical delays are better or worse than the rest of the country, because the only interprovincial data comes from the disputed Fraser Institute study.
Until this week, the closest the NDP came to a study into waiting lists was in the spring of 1997, when former health minister Eric Cline announced the formation of a quality-of-care committee. This committee of doctors, nurses and other health professionals was going to look into things such as bed closures, waiting lists and nurse-to-patient ratios to see if any problems existed.
Cline promised the committee would be furnished with "raw data" to help in its deliberations. Alas, the committee was never heard from again.
Finally, this week, Health Minister Pat Atkinson and associate minister Judy Junor announced they were appointing a three-member task force to tackle the waiting list issue. The announcement was accompanied by the refreshing acknowledgment that "some people are simply waiting too long for elective surgery."
The move was denounced by the Saskatchewan Party as political pandering on the eve of an election.
And, as Liberal Leader Jim Melenchuk pointed out, some of the problems should be rather obvious. He noted the policy in Regina and Saskatoon of closing one operating room every Friday.
He could have mentioned the decision to stop taking elective surgery bookings during the summer. Or the bizarre policy of making doctors and patients travel to outlying hospitals for surgical procedures. Or closing so many beds and laying off so many nurses over the years that there aren't enough nurses left in the province to keep operating rooms running at full tilt.
But Atkinson and Junor make a compelling argument for the need to identify both monetary and non-monetary solutions to the problem. The fact that the review is going to be completed before the next provincial budget should come as welcome news to everyone.
The only bad thing about the announcement was the timing. It should have happened a few years and a few dozen task forces sooner.

Full text: As more and more violent weather hits Scotland amid dire warnings about the disastrous effects of global warming, JIM McGHEE explains why a nationwide environmental strategy is essential...
THE storm clouds are gathering and the forecast is for wind and rain like you've never seen. There will be unparalleled wind damage to homes and factories.
Crops will be destroyed by rain and plagues of pests while homes with sea views will have salt water lapping around their dados.
This is not this week's forecast. It's not even this year's, although it comes pretty close. A summer like Scotland has just endured helps confirm the effects of global warming have already begun.
The world is already 0.6C hotter than it was 100 years ago. Last year was the warmest on record and since 1980 the world has had nine of its ten hottest years of modern times.
And things can only get worse - for decades to come. The problem is, no-one yet seems to have got the message that we have to start taking decisions NOW to avert future disasters.
Or that we have to seriously change the way we live if we are to stop filling the atmosphere with the greenhouse gases behind these horrendous changes to the natural world.
For there is no co-ordinated policy on where and how to build our industrial estates and homes; no cohesive coastal defence strategy; and no contingency plan to cope with disaster on a national scale. While the Government talks a good fight about curbing the car, there is little sign of it happening.
Today in Edinburgh, the stirrings of a Scotland-wide strategy might just start to emerge at a workshop hosted by the Scottish Office.
Today's meeting, bringing together environmentalists, industrialists and planners, is expected to lead to the creation of a new forum to advise the Scottish Parliament on climate change.
But how ready are politicians to take the necessary action? And how many of us really understand that dire warnings of violent weather are accepted as fact and not dismissed as fiction?
Environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth Scotland are not crowing. Once dismissed as Arran-pullovered muesli-eaters, their stock has rightly risen after world scientists finally confirmed their predictions of a stormy future for Earth Incorporated.
The organisation today publishes a radical new agenda for action which is being sent to every MP in Scotland.
The blueprint for a green future is aimed at cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent by 2010 through tough measures, including:
lNew laws forcing builders to insulate homes
lA major programme to line sections of the Scottish coast with offshore wind-power turbines
lStringent fuel efficiency standards at coal and gas power stations
l Making all local authorities cut carbon dioxide emissions in their area by the same 20 per cent.
With predictions of Scotland's temperatures rising by up to 2.6C by 2080, sea levels up by 3ft and almost 20 per cent more rainfall, the chilling report demands urgent action.
"We are simply not ready for what is going to hit us," said Dr Richard Dixon, FoES head of research.
"No-one realises how our lifestyle is going to change. The only people who are prepared are in the insurance industry, which is prepared to charge more for disaster cover or refuse to insure us if we are in a vulnerable area.
"Yet people continue to build houses on flood plains unaware of the risk. It's not just that the sea level will be higher, but seas will be driven higher by more serious storms which will very soon start to occur much more frequently.
"The once-in-100-years storm which planners now design buildings to withstand could come once every ten years. There might be three fierce storms in a summer which would cause major structural damage and devastate agriculture."
Dr Dixon says anyone who builds anything to last more than ten years should now be told to take account of weather changes - and that includes councils who have to approve all building projects. "We are only at the very beginning of people starting to take climate change seriously and planning ahead for it," he said.
"But we must prepare for the way the world is going to be in 20 years' time.
So what needs to be done now? Surely the least must be the creation of a Royal Commission for Scotland to gather evidence from experts on all fields on the implications of weather change on everything we take from granted, from fields of barley for the whisky industry to creation of raw materials on coastal sites around the Forth at Grangemouth and in Fife for the world's fuel and plastics industries.
A challenge for the Scottish Parliament is to create a vision of Scotland 50 years from now - and to take the decisions today which will make that vision a reality. The fact that MSPs will each have a parking space, and will work in centrally heated rooms hardly seems a good start. And it may eventually occur to political leaders that global warming offers an opportunity as well as a challenge.
For tackling the likely effects - and causes - of weather change will create not only jobs, but a more just society.
Better insulation would not only save poorer families money in fuel bills but also reduce the need for power from fossil-fuel power stations.
Jobs would be created by renewable energy schemes such as wind farms and public transport investment.
The CBI in Scotland is succeeding in helping members realise the marketing benefits of being seen to be green.
But assistant director Gerard Kelly says the vast majority of companies are not CBI members. And it is these small to medium-sized concerns that could really use Government help, perhaps in the form of tax incentives, to clean up their operations.
"There is a lot going on to improve the situation," he said. "If you walk up to any business person in the street, they will have a view about it. But a lot will still not know how to get practical support to effect change."
It appears industry shares the view of environmentalists that there is a need for clear and determined Government policies to change the way we live.
Environment Minister Lord Sewel has at least started to talk tough.
He said: "Our overarching theme should be to protect our natural environment by tackling issues at home which, in turn, will make a global contribution."
But, unfortunately, he cites in the Government's favour Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott's role in pushing world governments at recent talks in Buenos Aires towards acting globally.
This is the same John Prescott who promised a revolutionary new deal for public transport in Britain, but whose bold new world did not merit a mention in the Queen's Speech.
It's time our politicians got their acts together, otherwise those MSPs sitting in our new Holyrood parliament might need to take the upturned boats off the roof - and use them to get to work.

Full text: THE INSURANCE industry now appears to be concerned enough about climate change to invest in renewable energy, says Massey University's Associate Professor Ralph Sims.
Having recently returned from a Biomass for Energy and Industry conference in Germany, Prof Sims said a growing number of disasters, like Hurricane Mitch, were putting so much pressure on insurance companies, many were now taking steps to find out if climate change or greenhouse gas emissions could be the cause.
Since the 1960s, the number of natural disasters exceeding 100 deaths or $100 million in insurance claims had increased threefold, and the cost to the industry had skyrocketed. "This alarming growth has the insurance industry questioning its ability to continue to cover such claims . . . It's predicted that the annual loss burdens from natural disasters could rise US$50 billion by the end of the decade. In an effort to slow the escalation, the industry as a whole is looking to the cause."
Prof Sims said the insurance industry was taking the unprecedented step of investing in "no-regret" strategies, such as alternatives to fossil fuels for energy supply and encouraging the reduction of energy consumption. Their aim was to reduce emissions from fossil fuels, which appeared to be leading to climate change and increasing numbers of natural disasters.

Abstract: Preliminary estimates by the Worldwatch Institute and Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, put total losses from storms, floods, droughts and fires for the first 11 months of the year 48 per cent higher than the previous one-year record of more than $60 billion in 1996. The report said a combination of deforestation and climate change has caused this year's most severe disasters, among them Hurricane Mitch, the flooding of China's Yangtze River and Bangladesh's most extensive flood of the century. The most severe 1998 disasters listed in the report include hurricane Mitch, the deadliest Atlantic storm in 200 years, which has caused more than 10,000 deaths in Central America.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Violent weather has cost the world a record $89 billion US this year, more money than was lost from weather-related disasters in all of the 1980s, and researchers in a study blame human meddling for much of it.
Preliminary estimates by the Worldwatch Institute and Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, put total losses from storms, floods, droughts and fires for the first 11 months of the year 48 per cent higher than the previous one-year record of more than $60 billion in 1996.
This year's damage is also far ahead of the $55 billion in losses for the entire decade of the 1980s. Even when adjusted for inflation, the 1980s losses, at $82.7 billion, still fall short of the first 11 months of this year.
In addition to the material losses, the disasters have killed an estimated 32,000 people and displaced 300 million -- more than the population of the United States -- the report said.
The study is based on estimates from Worldwatch, an environmental research group, and Munich Re, the Frankfurt, Germany-based reinsurer, which writes policies that protect insurance companies from the risk of massive claims that might put them out of business.
The report said a combination of deforestation and climate change has caused this year's most severe disasters, among them Hurricane Mitch, the flooding of China's Yangtze River and Bangladesh's most extensive flood of the century.
"More and more, there's a human fingerprint in natural disasters in that we're making them more frequent and more intense and we're also . . . making them more destructive," said Seth Dunn, research associate and climate-change expert at the institute.
Deforestation
Dunn said when hillsides are left bare, rainfall will rush across the land or into rivers without being slowed by trees and allowed to be absorbed by the soil or evaporate back into the atmosphere. This leads to floods and landslides that are strong enough to wipe out roads, farms and fisheries far downstream.
Another element that has contributed to this year's losses is the growing population pressures that have led many people to settle on vulnerable flood plains and hillsides.
The most severe 1998 disasters listed in the report include hurricane Mitch, the deadliest Atlantic storm in 200 years, which has caused more than 10,000 deaths in Central America.
The study said Mitch hit an ecologically vulnerable region. Central America has experienced some of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, losing some two per cent to four per cent of its remaining forest cover each year, said the study.
Costly flooding
The costliest disaster of 1998, the report said, was the flooding of the Yangtze River in the summer. It killed more than 3,000 people, dislocated about 230 million people and incurred $30 billion in losses.
The study said while heavy summer rains are common in southern and central China, the Yangtze Basin has lost 85 per cent of its forest cover to logging and agriculture in recent decades, wetlands have been drained and the river heavily dammed.
Bangladesh suffered its most extensive flood of the century in the summer.
Two-thirds of the low-lying country located at the mouth of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers was flooded for months, 30 million people were left temporarily homeless, and 16,000 kilometres of roads were heavily damaged. Damage estimates exceed $3.4 billion.
Logging upriver in the Himalayas of northern India and Nepal exacerbated the disaster, as did the fact the region's rivers and flood plains have been filled with silt and constricted by development, the report said.

This leads to floods and landslides that are strong enough to wipe out roads, farms and fisheries far downstream.
"In a sense, we're turning up the faucets . . . and throwing away the sponges, like the forests and the wetlands," said Dunn.
Another element that has contributed to this year's losses is the growing population pressures that have led many people to settle on vulnerable flood plains and hillsides.
The most severe 1998 disasters listed in the report include Hurricane Mitch, the deadliest Atlantic storm in 200 years, which has caused more than 10,000 deaths in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Mitch caused damage estimated at $4 billion in Honduras and $1 billion in Nicaragua.
The study said Mitch hit an ecologically vulnerable region. Central American nations have experienced some of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, said the study.
The costliest disaster of 1998, according to the report, was the flooding of the Yangtze River in the summer.
It killed more than 3,000 people, dislocated about 230 million people and incurred $30 billion in losses.

Bangladesh suffered its most extensive flood of the century last summer.
Two-thirds of the low-lying country at the mouth of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers was flooded for months, 30 million people were left temporarily homeless, and 10,000 miles of roads were heavily damaged. Damage estimates exceed $3.4 billion.
Logging upriver in the Himalayas of north India and Nepal exacerbated the disaster.

Full text:   IT is the year 2098. As the tide laps up his front door, the last inhabitant of Grangemouth leaves his home for good.
Wading to high ground, with a few pitiful possessions, he has finally given up the unequal battle with the sea.
He turns to the deserted chimneys of the flooded oil refineries and shakes his fist in despair.
If it hadn't been for their part in global warming, he might still be in his home.
In other low-lying areas, thousands of Scots are evacuating their homes too.
Long ago, the Government gave up the fight against rising seas.
For 20 years, some people had lived in flood ghettos, battling high tides and perpetual dampness.
The rich have move out and other homes are uninsurable.
This nightmare scenario isn't a film set or eco-warrior fantasy.
According to Britain's leading scientists, it could be our reality in 100 years' time, as sea levels rise by a metre and rainfall increases.
Government agencies are taking the matter seriously. Research is on- going to identify which areas of the coast should be defended and which abandoned to the sea - but such work is sensitive because of implications for property values.
TOMORROW, Government Minister Lord Sewel chairs the second of a series of top-level meetings into the impact of climate change.
Last month, deputy PM John Prescott attended an international conference in Buenos Aires, at which a world disaster map was drawn up.
In a recent Science journal, Professor Duncan Wingham, head of a top- level team of scientists, said predictions about sea level rises - 40cm in the next 50 years - may be revised upwards.
"Millions of people live within one metre of sea level," he said.
"They could be under water in two centuries."
Dramatic climatic changes caused by global warming will change the map of Scotland forever.
The areas worst hit will be the Forth and Clyde estuaries. Tidal floods will come up the Forth as far as Stirling, taking back land reclaimed from the sea 100 years ago.
Towns like Paisley, al-ready vulnerable to floods, will become no- go areas. The Tay will flood daily over Dundee and Perth.
The spit of land on the Dornoch Forth will disappear and land around Inverness and Cromarty will be under water.
The Hebridean coastline will be redrawn as the sea reclaims the machair. Dumfries, Annan and Gretna may be reclaimed too.
And parts of Cumnock, Callander, Dumfries, Dumbarton, Largs, Lochwinnoch, Gourock, Falkirk, Elgin and Kirkintilloch may be made uninhabitable by regular severe flooding.
As a possible predictor of the future, North Ronaldsay folk have been cut off for two weeks as heavy rain has turned their air strip into a soggy mudbath.
This and other island air strips may require hard-core runways if life is to be sustainable.
NO ONE is more aware of the weather changes than insurance companies.
They warn that some areas may become "red-lined" - uninsurable.
The head of NatWest's insurance division, David Lennan, said: "Under- writers are likely to refuse cover for homes in regions where frequent flooding or coastal erosion is likely and the price of these homes is also likely to fall."
Last year, insurers paid out pounds 545 million on weather-related claims.
Dr Richard Dixon from Friends of the Earth Scotland added: "Floods which used to be expected once every 10 years now happen every year."
If it's any consolation, England will be worse hit.
It is lower lying, the rocks are softer and Britain is tilting, so that England is sinking by up to 2mm a year. And 13,000 hectares - the size of Jersey - could be lost to rising seas in the next 20 years.
SCIENTISTS say global warming CAN be slowed if everyone makes an effort.
WE have considerable power at the moment because we can buy electricity from any company we choose. Inquire about companies selling renewable energy - i.e. not from fossil fuels.
TURN down your thermostat by 1nC and save an average pounds 31.50 (electric heating) or pounds 26.25 (gas heating) per year.
INSULATE your loft with 15cms of glass fibre and lag hot pipes. You could save up to pounds 70 a year.
PUT compact fluorescent light bulbs in your three most used lights. They produce the same light for about a quarter of the energy and last eight times longer.
USE your car less. WALK short journeys - this will get you fit and save money. Live close to work and use local shops. Avoid using out- of-town shopping centres.
ONLY boil the amount of water you need. Use cooler temperatures and full loads in your washing machine. Defrost your fridge regularly.

Abstract: Violent weather has cost the world a record $89 billion this year, more money than was lost from weather-related disasters in all of the 1980s, and researchers in a study released Friday blame human meddling for much of it. Preliminary estimates by the Worldwatch Institute and Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, put total losses from storms, floods, droughts and fires for the first 11 months of the year 48 percent higher than the previous one-year record, $60 billion in 1996. This year's damage was also far ahead of the $55 billion in losses - $82.7 billion when adjusted for inflation - for the entire 1980s.

Full text: Violent weather has cost the world a record $89 billion this year, more money than was lost from weather-related disasters in all of the 1980s, and researchers in a study released Friday blame human meddling for much of it.
Preliminary estimates by the Worldwatch Institute and Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, put total losses from storms, floods, droughts and fires for the first 11 months of the year 48 percent higher than the previous one-year record, $60 billion in 1996.
This year's damage was also far ahead of the $55 billion in losses - $82.7 billion when adjusted for inflation - for the entire 1980s.
This year's disasters also have killed an estimated 32,000 people and displaced 300 million - more than the population of the United States - according to the report.
The study is based on estimates from Worldwatch, an environmental research group, and Munich Re of Frankfurt, Germany, which writes policies that protect insurance companies from massive claims that might put them out of business.
The report says deforestation and climate change have caused this year's most severe disasters, among them Hurricane Mitch, the flooding of China's Yangtze River and Bangladesh's most extensive flood of the century.
"More and more, there's a human fingerprint in natural disasters in that we're making them more frequent and more intense and we're also . . . making them more destructive," said Seth Dunn, research associate and climate change expert at the institute.
Dunn said when hillsides are left bare, rainfall will rush across the land or into rivers without being slowed by trees and allowed to be absorbed by the soil or evaporate back into the atmosphere. This leads to floods and landslides strong enough to wipe out roads, farms and fisheries downstream.
Hurricane Mitch, the deadliest Atlantic storm in 200 years, has caused more than 10,000 deaths in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador, and caused damage estimated at $4 billion in Honduras and $1 billion in Nicaragua.
The costliest disaster of 1998, according to the report, was the flooding of the Yangtze River in the summer. It killed more than 3,000 people, dislocated about 230 million people and caused $30 billion in losses.
