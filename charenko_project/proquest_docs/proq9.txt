Abstract: ATLANTA (CP) -- Costs from North American weather disasters will continue to escalate dramatically unless continent-wide precautions are taken, researchers told a U.S.-Canada symposium on the issue Wednesday. The Canadian and U.S. governments are launching a major research effort to understand, predict and minimize the costs of such disasters, which are forecast by many to become more frequent due to global warming. U.S. losses due to weather events have risen to $6 billion US annually in the 1990s from $100 million annually in the 1950s, [William White] said. Hurricane Andrew alone, in 1992, caused $30 billion in damage. Losses from hurricane Floyd have not been calculated.

Full text: ATLANTA (CP) -- Costs from North American weather disasters will continue to escalate dramatically unless continent-wide precautions are taken, researchers told a U.S.-Canada symposium on the issue Wednesday.
The Canadian and U.S. governments are launching a major research effort to understand, predict and minimize the costs of such disasters, which are forecast by many to become more frequent due to global warming.
"We are going to have to adapt, there's no two ways about it," William White, a top adviser at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said at the opening of the three-day meeting.
"Climate change is coming, it's here now, it's going to continue, and it's just a matter of how fast and how serious it's going to be and what the regional impact is going to be."
Precautions could include restricting development in vulnerable areas, making building codes more stringent and improving forecasting.
The conference is being attended by some 50 climatologists, bureaucrats, insurance executives, computer experts and emergency preparedness officials.
U.S. losses due to weather events have risen to $6 billion US annually in the 1990s from $100 million annually in the 1950s, White said. Hurricane Andrew alone, in 1992, caused $30 billion in damage. Losses from hurricane Floyd have not been calculated.
Last year's ice storm cost Canada $2 billion Cdn and the disaster would have been worse if critical installations in Montreal had lost power, as almost did happen, said Gordon McBean, assistant deputy environment minister.
"The whole water supply system and infrastructure of the Island of Montreal lives and dies on the existence of electric power and there was, like, one line left still standing," McBean said.
"If it had failed, the sewage pumps would have failed, the sewage system would have backed up, the water supply system itself would have failed."
Costs from natural disasters around the world have risen partly because population has risen -- there is simply more property to be damaged. As well, more people are living in risky areas like flood plains and coastlines.
Paradoxically, modern technology can also increase vulnerability since power and communications systems across vast areas are intertwined, and a breakdown in one place can have repercussions in another.

At the same time, many scientists expect that global warming will intensify the hydrological cycle -- the cycle of water evaporation and precipitation -- causing more frequent and intense weather extremes.
David Easterling of the U.S. National Climatic Date Centre in Ashville, N.C., said the record global temperature was broken 16 months in a row from May 1997 to August 1998.
The average temperature in Canada has increased by close to a degree Celsius in the past century, said Hogg.
The warming is attributed to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases, which trap heat from the sun. The largest source of greenhouse emissions is the burning of fossil fuels.

Full text: ATLANTA - Costs from North American weather disasters will continue to escalate dramatically unless continent-wide precautions are taken, researchers told a U.S.-Canada symposium on the issue Wednesday.
The Canadian and U.S. governments are launching a major research effort to understand, predict and minimize the costs of such disasters, which are forecast by many to become more frequent due to global warming.
"We are going to have to adapt, there's no two ways about it," William White, a top adviser at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said at the opening of the three-day meeting.
"Climate change is coming, it's here now, it's going to continue, and it's just a matter of how fast and how serious it's going to be and what the regional impact is going to be."
Precautions could include restricting development in vulnerable areas, making building codes more stringent and improving forecasting.
The conference is being attended by some 50 climatologists, bureaucrats, insurance executives, computer experts and emergency preparedness officials.
U.S. losses due to weather events have risen to $6 billion (U.S.) annually in the 1990s from $100 million annually in the 1950s, White said. Hurricane Andrew alone, in 1992, caused $30 billion in damage. Losses from hurricane Floyd this year have not been calculated.
Last year's ice storm cost Canada $2 billion Canadian and the disaster would have been far worse if critical installations in Montreal had lost electric power, as almost did happen, said Gordon McBean, assistant deputy environment minister.
"The whole water supply system and infrastructure of the Island of Montreal lives and dies on the existence of electric power and there was, like, one line left still standing," McBean said.
"If it had failed, the sewage pumps would have failed, the sewage system would have backed up, the water supply system itself would have failed."
Costs from natural disasters around the world have risen partly because population has risen -- there is simply more property to be damaged. As well, more people are living in risky areas like flood plains and coastlines.
Paradoxically, modern technology can also increase vulnerability since power and communications systems across vast areas are intertwined, and a breakdown in one place can have repercussions in another.
At the same time, many scientists expect that global warming will intensify the hydrological cycle -- the cycle of water evaporation and precipitation -- causing more frequent and intense weather extremes.
David Easterling of the U.S. National Climatic Date Centre in Ashville, N.C., said the record global temperature was broken 16 months in a row from May 1997 to August 1998.
The average temperature in Canada has increased by close to a degree Celsius in the past century, said Hogg.
The warming is attributed to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases, which trap heat from the sun. The largest source of greenhouse emissions is the burning of fossil fuels.

"North American is becoming even more vulnerable to weather extremes," said White.
At the same time, many scientists expect that global warming will intensify the hydrological cycle -- the cycle of water evapouration and precipitation -- causing more frequent and intense weather extremes.
"Because we're putting more water vapour into the atmosphere, we expect that rainstorms will be more intense just because there's more water to get out of the air and on to the ground," said Bill Hogg of Canada's federal Environment Department.

Bush did himself and his party alike a service in denouncing the proposal of the House Republican leadership to create the appearance of lower government spending by stretching out payments to the working poor next year. House Republican whip Tom DeLay, the retrograde notion's principal sponsor, said the party's leading presidential candidate "obviously doesn't understand how Congress works." Perhaps he doesn't, but he clearly understands better than Mr. DeLay the difference between a good idea and a bad one. It was the governor who provided the reality check in this exchange.

Prepare for disaster
Vice President Al Gore loves to champion federal measures to save the Earth from global warming, and congressional Republicans love to mock them. Both sides give short shrift to a more urgent challenge: the need to plan rationally for climate upheavals. Scientists generally agree that even if the United States turns "green" tomorrow and radically reduces its fossil fuel emissions, the Earth's warming, and the extreme weather it fosters, will continue.
In the last decade, heat waves, storms, floods and other climatic events associated to some degree with global warming have saddled U.S. cities with $140 billion in property damage, according to a statement 576 U.S. mayors sent Congress earlier this week. Of course, not every hurricane can or should be blamed on global warming...
Most critical is protecting U.S. taxpayers from the nation's global warming burdens. Start with incentives to strengthen building codes in high-risk areas. A greater burden of flood risk should be borne by those who already own coastal property; currently, they are subsidized by the less-affluent purchasers of federal flood insurance in inland areas.
An even greater danger to taxpayers comes from a bill now pending in Congress and backed by the insurers that would make the U.S. Treasury responsible for insurance companies' losses in large natural disasters. That should be a nonstarter. By spending tens of millions of dollars now on ways to adjust federal policies and private business practices to climate change, multibillion-dollar consequences of natural disasters might well be avoided.

In the last decade, heat waves, storms, floods and other climatic events associated to some degree with global warming have saddled U.S. cities with $140 billion in property damage, according to a statement 576 U.S. mayors sent Congress earlier this week. Of course, not every hurricane can or should be blamed on global warming.
Ideas for solutions are surprisingly simple. Farmers could guard against some losses by planting hardier crops. For example, the Agriculture Department estimates that by using more genetically engineered crops, cereal grain production could be stabilized despite sharp temperature shifts; otherwise, says the USDA, cereal grain production will fall 18% to 29%. Insurers can increase their deductibles for clients who fail to protectively upgrade their properties. Critics rightly ask why inland Floridians should pay special insurance premium assessments on their pickup trucks and bungalows to underwrite highly predictable storm damage to seaside mansions. States and localities can dump outmoded zoning laws that encourage developers to build on eroding beaches and flood-prone plains.
Much of the problem is due to the needless polarization of the issue. Last month, congressional Republicans denied the Clinton administration the $85-million funding increase it requested for federal programs to predict and prepare for global warming. But the federal programs, begun as the Global Change Research Program by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, are aimed not at the dubious goal of preventing global warming but at the practical matter of helping industry, taxpayers and others prepare for and cope with its inevitable effects.
Most critical is protecting U.S. taxpayers from the nation's global warming burdens. Start with incentives to strengthen building codes in high-risk areas. A greater burden of flood risk should be borne by those who already own coastal property; currently, they are subsidized by the less-affluent purchasers of federal flood insurance in inland areas.

Big sport utility vehicles not cheap, practical nor economical to run: [Final Edition]

Abstract: The U.S. single-vehicle rollover death rate in small utility vehicles was more than seven times as high as the rate in the largest cars (124 deaths per million registered vehicles versus 16) in 1997, according to the highway safety institute. Single-vehicle rollover crashes accounted for 50 per cent of occupant deaths in utility vehicles in 1997 compared with 34 per cent of deaths in pickups and 18 per cent in cars, they report. Even the most ardent environmentalists, however, recognize that SUVs and minivans are here to stay. What's needed, they say, are regulations to make them safer, cleaner and more fuel efficient. Car buyers must also evaluate their vehicle needs to determine if they really need an SUV or a minivan, says Chris Rolfe of West Coast Environmental Law. Like the Clean Air Alliance and BCAA, Rolfe says mandatory fuel- efficiency standards must apply to all cars and trucks equally so that all Canadian vehicles will be cleaner.

Full text: VANCOUVER -- Kerrisdale resident Dave McLaughlin fits the profile of most urban sport-utility-vehicle drivers. He's a 30-something sports enthusiast who likes the power of his forest-green Jeep Grand Cherokee. McLaughlin, however, hardly ever takes his SUV into the forest. The only time his jeep leaves paved road is once or twice a year when he goes fishing near his parents' home in Kelowna.
"I like the big engine, but the cost of operating it is a drag," he said of the price to fill the large gas tank. "It's not very practical for the city. My next vehicle will be a car."
They may not be practical, cheap or affordable to run, but SUVs, minivans and light trucks are a popular choice for city drivers even though most of them never leave the open road.
And because SUVs and minivans are classified as light trucks, they don't have to meet the same fuel-efficiency standards as passenger vehicles (cars) -- even though that's how the majority of them are used.
Vehicles are among the largest users of fossil fuels. And the burning of fossil fuels is the biggest contributor to air pollution and the release of greenhouse gases, which has led to increased global warming and climate change.
In the Lower Mainland, SUVs, minivans and light trucks release between 25 to 175 per cent more emissions of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons than regular cars, according to a 1998 Greater Vancouver Regional District air quality report. And with an average of 30,000 new cars and trucks on Lower Mainland roads each year, it's clear that our air is only going to get worse.
In response, the B.C. Automobile Association is petitioning the government to reduce fuel emissions through tougher vehicle fuel efficiency standards.
BCAA president Bill Bullis wrote in this newspaper last November that in 1981, the federal government passed the Motor Vehicle Fuel Consumption Standards Act which would require auto manufacturers to meet increasingly tougher fuel efficiency standards over a period of time. But 17 years later, the act still hasn't been proclaimed law.
Canadians must lobby their politicians for change since this is clearly a political, not a technological, problem, the BCAA advocates.
SUV drivers also cite safety as another reason they like their big vehicles.
While you're more likely to fare better in a SUV if you crash, your chances of being involved in a fatal rollover are much higher than in a car, says the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a U.S. non-profit group.
The U.S. single-vehicle rollover death rate in small utility vehicles was more than seven times as high as the rate in the largest cars (124 deaths per million registered vehicles versus 16) in 1997, according to the highway safety institute. Single-vehicle rollover crashes accounted for 50 per cent of occupant deaths in utility vehicles in 1997 compared with 34 per cent of deaths in pickups and 18 per cent in cars, they report.
The BCAA says the solution is improving driving behaviour through education, not hiding drivers behind larger vehicles.
This is an interesting message just as the mother of all SUVs -- Ford's new 19-foot (5.8-metre) Excursion that weighs in at 3.2 ton (3,200 kg) -- hits the road.
Even the most ardent environmentalists, however, recognize that SUVs and minivans are here to stay. What's needed, they say, are regulations to make them safer, cleaner and more fuel efficient. Car buyers must also evaluate their vehicle needs to determine if they really need an SUV or a minivan, says Chris Rolfe of West Coast Environmental Law.
In numerous articles about the Excursion, Ford officials say they are just meeting consumer demand. Rolfe disagrees.
"Vehicle manufacturers are pushing people to buy luxury trucks and SUVs because they're more profitable and subject to less stringent emissions and safety standards," he said.
Like the Clean Air Alliance and BCAA, Rolfe says mandatory fuel- efficiency standards must apply to all cars and trucks equally so that all Canadian vehicles will be cleaner.

Solar power's day will come; And ARISE Technologies will be ready: [Final Edition]

Author: Strathdee, Mike

Abstract: After reading the article, he spoke to Steven Strong, a U.S. architect who had built a solar home. The two men discussed issues around solar energy. Strong sent [Ian MacLellan] a copy of a book he had written on the topic, and then invited him to a conference in Boston. Both the U.S. and European Community governments have goals of deploying one million solar roofs by 2010. MacLellan thinks Canada should target 100,000 roofs by 2010. The company's first target markets are the northeastern U.S and midwest, where electricity costs are the highest. ARISE currently employs 15, and hopes to be profitable within a few years. In June, it launched SolarSense.com, a joint venture with Statpower, a Vancouver firm which manufactures power inverter equipment used in ARISE systems.

Full text:   Ian MacLellan sees a day coming when solar energy will be a huge industry, providing clean and renewable electricity and heat for our homes.
While the idea of solar power as a mainstream energy source has been talked about for decades, the Waterloo businessman thinks it is about to become reality.
MacLellan, founder of ARISE Technologies Corporation of Waterloo, isn't concerned that he might be entering the market too soon.
"I'd much rather be early than late," he said. "With what's going on now, I think we're in the right place at the right time."
The ARISE acronym -- it stands for Appropriate, Renewable, Intelligent, Sustainable Energy -- sums up the focus of the solar systems business.
Traditionally, companies in the solar energy field have sold systems to people living in distant locations whose only other option would be to use a generator, or for small niche applications such as heating swimming pools.
ARISE is developing comprehensive systems for homes which are connected to the electrical grid, providing much of the electricity and hot water for new homes which incorporate its products.
In some ways, the solar energy market is at the same stage as the personal computer market was in 1975, with the potential to transform society the way telecommunications has, he said.
"I don't think it takes a lot of vision to say that in 25 years, we'll have environmentally responsibly distributed power generators in our cars and our homes."
MacLellan is fascinated with the question of what will succeed the information age as the next major era.
He thinks the fourth wave of society will be sustainable development, a wave which will change all the rules as much as information age has. "How do we deliver a North American lifestyle to the world's population? That's the question of the 21st century."
ARISE was incorporated five years ago, and spent the first two years of its existence as part of a venture capital firm that MacLellan started in Vancouver in 1989.
Among other things, the latter company acquired Pachena Scientific Industries and Electronics, a Vancouver contract electronics manufacturer, from BCTel. MacLellan, 42, is a Toronto native with a degree in electrical engineering technology from Ryerson. He worked in sales for Hewlett-Packard and Oracle before being bitten by the entrepreneurial bug.
"In the past, I've been involved with situations where we've created several thousand jobs, and I think we'll do that again."
The spark which led to the creation of ARISE came from an article entitled "Solar Flair" which MacLellan read in a Feb., 1996 issue of Harrowsmith magazine.
At the time, he wanted to get involved in the early stage of an energy market with huge potential. "I wanted to be involved in a business that made a contribution to our society."
After reading the article, he spoke to Steven Strong, a U.S. architect who had built a solar home. The two men discussed issues around solar energy. Strong sent MacLellan a copy of a book he had written on the topic, and then invited him to a conference in Boston.
MacLellan went on to do a year of consulting for Strong's firm, Advanced Energy Systems, which had received a number of research grants from the U.S. Department of Energy and provided solar systems used at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.
MacLellan, who was living in Vancouver at the time, joined the firm's board and was asked to move to the U.S.
But he chose instead to move back to Waterloo, where he had lived in the early 1980s while working for H-P, and did six months research prior to launching ARISE. In June 1997, he hired two University of Waterloo mechanical engineering graduates who were eager to work in renewable energy. That fall, ARISE rented space in an empty warehouse on Phillip Street, near UW.
By the spring of 1998, he was offering ownership in the company to employees and business advisers who invested time or money for shares.
Solar is already cost effective in some applications. "For remote applications -- mountain tops, villages and cottages -- for outer space, it is the only cost effective way to do it (generate power)."
"Anywhere there is no hydroelectric grid, solar is a very viable alternative."
Within five years, solar will be cost effective in grid- connected applications, he predicts. "This industry, I believe, will grow into a very, very large business."
The costs associated with manufacturing solar cells continue to decline, while their performance doubles every five to seven years.
In 1993, there were only 10 grid-connected photovoltaic homes -- houses which take power from the sun, then send any excess into the electrical grid --- built in Japan.
By last year, that number had climbed to 9,600. The Japanese government has a goal of 75,000 such homes by 2003.
Both the U.S. and European Community governments have goals of deploying one million solar roofs by 2010. MacLellan thinks Canada should target 100,000 roofs by 2010.
There are fewer than 40 grid-connected buildings in Canada, according to a recent report on the Canadian photovoltaic power market by Lisa-Dignard-Bailey of Natural Resources Canada's CANMET Energy Diversification Laboratory.
But Canada's total PV power installed capacity increased by 32 per cent last year, driven largely by sales to the cottage and recreational applications markets.
MacLellan thinks a massive move to solar would result in corresponding cuts to greenhouse gas and smog emissions. "If we can use the energy from the sun, it would make a lot of sense."
Nor is the Canadian climate as much of an impediment to solar deployment as some would think. By adjusting panels to the correct angle, a person with a solar system can get close to 1,500 hours of noon-day sun in Waterloo, compared to 2,000 in California.
ARISE's solar systems can be used as a roof and weather seal or can be bolted on top of an existing roof.
Initially, the company will target higher-end new home construction for its systems, which will cost $50,000 to $55,000. The system would heat a home and swimming pool, generating energy savings of $200 to $250 a month.
The financial payback period -- time required to recover the investment based on savings from the system -- will be between 20 and 30 years for the early systems. ARISE hopes to get that down to less than 10 years, said Michael Ben, the company's chief financial officer.
"What we're seeing in the early adopter market is, it's not a price-sensitive issue," MacLellan said.
Five years out in the mass market, he thinks a 10-year payback will be attractive.
ARISE wants to build 10 pilot home systems next year, then start full-scale production in June, 2001.
ARISE's systems have the ability to generate power beyond a home's requirements. In jurisdictions where the laws permit, the systems will feed energy back into the electrical grid when most needed, and turn back the meter of the home which is selling to the grid.
At least 27 U.S. states have net metering legislation in place. That number is expected to rise as the trend to de-regulation of energy utilities increases.
Utility de-regulation "is the single biggest opportunity for what we're doing."
De-regulation changes all the rules, with utilities looking at environmental costs as well as price of power, he said.
MacLellan expects to see an increase in the number of energy companies as a result of de-regulation in Ontario and elsewhere, with firms providing both gas and electric power, as well as other services. "What we think they'll also want to do is provide renewable energy systems for the homeowner."
Even some of the big oil companies are showing interest in solar. Shell announced last year that it would invest $200 million in photovoltaic technology through its Shell Energy business, he said. Shell had previously exited the business in 1986 after a five-year joint venture with Motorola.
Shell apparently believes that in the year 2050, 10 per cent of all worldwide energy will be derived from photovoltaics. By that time, solar systems will cost one-10th what they do today and offer the lowest cost source of energy, MacLellan said.
"The interesting thing is, when you make the investment in PV (photovoltaics), the fuel's free."
He foresees a time when people will use solar systems in their garages to generate hydrogen for their cars.
The underlying technology is already quite durable, with manufacturers offering 25-year warranties on PV units.
Disney installed 10,000 PV modules at its Epcot Centre resort in Florida 17 years ago. When they were tested recently, only six were not still working.
PV units are made up of oxygen, silicon and aluminum, the three most plentiful elements on the planet. PV systems' silicon strips convert photons to electrons, harnessing the power of sunlight to make DC electricity.
Solar thermal systems involve running water or glycol through tubes which are coated with black copper and lie under glass. As the fluid is heated by the sun, it in turn heats water used in homes or swimming pools.
Every day, the sun provides 27,000 times the energy used in the world, MacLellan said. "If you took a piece of land the size of New Mexico (and equipped it with PV collectors), you could take all the energy mankind needs."
ARISE's systems will be designed to generate from solar half to two-thirds of the energy required for a building, which MacLellan believes is currently "the sweet spot in terms of your economies (of scale)."
The company expects to receive a U.S. patent this fall for its solar thermal product.
ARISE is trying to leverage from other work wherever possible, and has licensed technology from a number of sources. It is working with several utilities on experiments to measure the performance of hybrid systems, combining conventional electricity with solar energy storage.
Its systems have built-in redundancies to serve emergency situations, if for instance power were knocked out through a disaster such as the ice storm which walloped eastern Ontario and Quebec during the winter of 1998.
ARISE's products will replace energy produced at peak periods from coal-fired or nuclear generators which utilities are often losing money on, he said. "Irrespective of the environmental aspects of nuclear (power), what we're seeing is, nuclear doesn't pay."
Understanding how solar systems can interact with utilities will be a key research area for ARISE over the next several years.
U.S. research into "green" power and green pricing shows that people are willing to pay a small premium, around $1 to $10 a month, to minimize the impact of their energy use on the environment. Local research lends some support to that notion as well.
A study conducted by Loralyn Wild, a student in UW's Environment and Resource Studies program under the supervision of professor Ian Rowlands, found that 57 per cent of Waterloo North Hydro customers would be willing to pay more for electricity from renewable sources. Wild mailed a survey to 300 customers of the utility, which provides power to homes in Waterloo as well as Woolwich and Wellesley Townships.
On average, the people who were willing to pay more said they would pay 7.5 per cent more, which Rowlands estimates to be about $5.10 a month.
Unfortunately, U.S. experience has shown that most people who say they are willing to pay more for green power don't follow through when given the chance to do so, Rowlands said. The sign-up level for green power tends to be only in the one to five per cent range.
In California, only about one per cent of consumers switched power suppliers in the first year after de-regulation of its energy market. A study of the California experience suggests that almost all of the people who switched energy suppliers did so in order to adopt a more environmentally friendly power supply.
MacLellan isn't reluctant to remind people of the environmental benefits of solar and the problem of climate change, which he views as a serious problem. "The balance of evidence is that we are impacting our environment."
Insurance companies are becoming concerned about climate change, as are some government climatologists, he said.
"The onus of proof needs to be on the oil companies to prove that they're not impairing the environment, not on us to prove that they are."
Most people don't understand where their power comes from or the pollution which may be caused by that power generation source, Rowlands noted.
But comfort heating produces about 40 per cent of the carbon dioxide Canadians are putting into the atmosphere, and shouldn't be overlooked as a contributing factor in air pollution or climate change problems, said Terry Hollands, a professor of mechanical engineering at UW and leading solar researcher.
"We're going to have to do some different things (in order to mitigate environmental damage), and that includes solar energy."
Hollands thinks that increased use of solar will come about through improved affordability, and increases in the price of fossil fuels as their negative impacts on the environment are accepted by political leaders in a number of nations. "Some time, we're going to have a carbon tax, I have no doubt about that," he said."
ARISE hopes to install several thousand solar systems in North America within five years, something MacLellan views as a conservative target.
The company's first target markets are the northeastern U.S and midwest, where electricity costs are the highest. ARISE currently employs 15, and hopes to be profitable within a few years. In June, it launched SolarSense.com, a joint venture with Statpower, a Vancouver firm which manufactures power inverter equipment used in ARISE systems.
SolarSense sells a small, portable solar energy system which can be used in lap-top computers or at modest cottages.
Long-term objectives for ARISE include being a public company within five years. "With the right strategic investor, a corporation shows interest in us, a lot could happen a lot quicker," Ben said.
ARISE has had discussions with several builders, and has identified a number of sites for prototype systems. One system is already in use at a demonstration house at the Kortright Centre near Vaughn, producing 6,000 kilowatts of electricity a year, about $500 worth.
Another system will be shipped to the Saskatchewan Advanced Energy House in Saskatoon this fall.
Other organizations have expressed interest in seeing the results from a system which will be installed on an addition to MacLellan's home by year-end.

Full text: THE Scottish Executive must take the lead in setting targets for climate change, a leading environmentalist said last night.
Mr Kevin Dunion, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said unless figures were laid down for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in Scotland, the UK Government would not be seen to be serious about tackling the issue.
Delivering the Institute of Energy's 1999 Scottish Energy Lecture in Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall last night, Mr Dunion said: "The Scottish Executive must spell out what contribution Scotland will make towards the Government's target of a 20% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010.
"Unless some leadership is exercised, Scotland is in danger of dragging its heels on this crucial issue. We have international agreement on reducing emissions, Scotland must not only play its part but be seen to do so."
He also called on Scotland to take the lead in accelerating the development of renewable energy production.
"The UK is committed to a target of 10% of our power coming from renewables by 2010, Scotland should aim considerably higher, given our wind-power potential."
Mr Dunion urged Scottish Ministers to press Chancellor Gordon Brown to allocate more money from the proposed climate change levy, under which businesses will be charged for use of fossil fuels and electricity, to help industries become more energy efficient.
Proceeds from the so-called energy tax, due to be introduced in April 2001, will be returned to business in the form of National Insurance Contributions or be used to improve energy efficiency.
His comments came as a World Wide Fund for Nature report said the environment and the economy would both benefit under the levy.

Damage claims challenged
Claims that the proposed energy tax will inflict serious damage on British industry have been challenged in a study published yesterday by WWF-UK, the environmental charity. The government's proposals will have little impact on - or may benefit - industries employing 93 per cent of the UK workforce and earning 90 per cent of gross domestic product, according to the study carried out by Ecotech, a consultancy. The government is planning to use the £1.75bn a year proceeds from the climate change levy to reduce employers' National Insurance contributions. The report, concluded that no industry was likely to lose out by more than 4 per cent of the value of its sales from the combined effect of the levy and the cut in NICs. In practice, the impact is likely to be significantly smaller because energy-intensive industries are negotiating reductions in the levy with the government in return for introducing energy saving measures.Vanessa Houlder Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999.

Full text:   Industry leaders were accused yesterday of inflating the costs to business of Labour's proposed green tax. The climate change levy will benefit the environment and could help fund 7,000 extra nurses and 3,500 more teachers, according to World Wide Fund for Nature research.
Most firms will face only minimal costs from the levy on business energy use or will be better off, because the government has promised to hand back the proceeds of the tax by cutting employers' national insurance contribution rates, the WWF says.

Abstract: At an unprecedented special session of the UN general assembly starting today, representatives of small island states, from the Maldives to Micronesia, are demanding greater efforts to combat climate change, rising seas and globalisation. These minnows of the international scene are urging the UN's bigger fish to put their money where their mouths are in finding ways to remedy the destructive effects of global warming, over- development and natural disasters on coasts, coral reefs and forests. `We are talking about very small nations that do not normally have access to the councils of the world,' said Tuiloma Neroni Slade, Samoa's envoy to the UN and chairman of the 43-strong Alliance of Small Island States.

Full text: Palm-fringed atolls and sun-drenched paradises across the globe are appealing to the United Nations this week for help to tackle problems that could - literally - wash them away.
At an unprecedented special session of the UN general assembly starting today, representatives of small island states, from the Maldives to Micronesia, are demanding greater efforts to combat climate change, rising seas and globalisation.
These minnows of the international scene are urging the UN's bigger fish to put their money where their mouths are in finding ways to remedy the destructive effects of global warming, over- development and natural disasters on coasts, coral reefs and forests.
`We are talking about very small nations that do not normally have access to the councils of the world,' said Tuiloma Neroni Slade, Samoa's envoy to the UN and chairman of the 43-strong Alliance of Small Island States.
Mr Slade praises the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, for doing `a hell of a lot' to focus attention on these Lilliputs - a surprising 36 of them are fully-fledged members of the UN. But more is needed.
`These problems are not of the making of those countries and none have the capacity to deal with global issues. We want to tell the UN system to bear in mind the small size of our countries and the smallness of our resources,' he said.
The 1992 Earth Summit in Rio put the islands' plight on the international agenda, but an `action plan' agreed in Barbados in 1994 has not been implemented and aid programmes have shrunk.
For many the biggest worry is the rising sea level, already 18cm higher than a century ago from the thermal expansion of the oceans and melting glaciers attributed to greenhouse-gas emissions.
The implications for the islands, said Mohammed al-Ashry, chairman of the UN's Global Environment Facility, include the forced relocation of millions of people and billions of dollars damage to property.
In Kiribati and Tuvalu, which have some of the most diverse and fragile ecosystems on earth, the seas have swamped small islets, destroyed roads and bridges and crumbled burial sites into the ocean.
Officials in the Maldives say 80% of its atolls could be inundated. The Seychelles have similar fears. In the Marshall Islands, the highest land is a litte over two metres above sea level.
Several islands face the infiltration of fresh-water reserves by sea water, making drinking water brackish and the soil too salty for staple root crops.
In addition to natural disasters like Hurricanes George and Mitch, the smallest states are about to lose the trade concessions that have sustained their largely agricultural economies. Recent World Trade Organisation rulings are cutting preferences, especially in the EU's relations with former African, Caribbean and Pacific colonies.
Tourism, which many islands turned to as a rapid money earner, generates waste and strains water supplies. Transport, insurance and communications costs are steep for islands hit by the backlash of the Asian financial crisis.

Abstract: The world's weather has definitely turned worse since the ill- fated decision by Miami's national hurricane centre to use the odd David and Mike when naming hurricanes, cyclones and so on (previously only female names were chosen). But the fad for handles that could be either/or (Floyd?) has given climate change a new twist, as Max Taylor, the suave chairman of Lloyd's of London, found out this week. He was due to attend a top-level insurance summit in Bermuda, but for once the insurers forecast the weather correctly and cried off after realising their 747s would have been winging in at exactly the moment Hurricane Gert (who?) hit the sunny tax haven. But the summiteers at the IMF knees-up in Washington are made of sterner stuff. Nothing kept them from the white wine and peanuts, not even the Oxfam protesters who picketed the Fund's HQ on Thursday handing out boxes of medicine representing the bitter economic pills the IMF routinely prescribes for the Third World. In fact, the `pills' were mints, and very yummy too. Inside, the IMF's briefing was conducted against the usual Man-from-Uncle-style logo, with the addition of `www.imf.org' emphasising the new, accessible IMF. Rather too accessible for the comfort of fund chief Michel Camdessus, who, noting the wealth of griff on the website, described it as `perhaps rather an overabundance of information'.

Rather too accessible for the comfort of fund chief Michel Camdessus, who, noting the wealth of griff on the website, described it as `perhaps rather an overabundance of information'.
Meanwhile, the British embassy in Washington has once again been snubbed by Gordon Brown, who is breaking with tradition for the second year running by cold-shouldering our splendid residency on Massachusetts Avenue in favour of - horror! - a commercial hotel. Last year the chancellor booked into the Watergate, this year the Four Seasons is his rumoured billet. A dig at our costly diplomatic service? It seems not. The chancellor, we hear, is concerned only to ensure access to a decent gym.
And a decent railway service wouldn't come amiss. After last week's triumphalist speech in New York about Britain's economic miracle (sell everything!), Mr Brown decided to toodle down to Washington in his role as chairman of the IMF's interim committee (i/ c policy and so on) to see Mr Camdessus. To make him feel at home, the train operator laid on a five-hour delay. Not only were IMF bigwigs left to cool their heels but the chancellor also missed his connecting flight home.
Back in Mr Brown's native land, Aberdeen took some stick last weekend in a survey fingering the oil town as the worst business location in Britain: no roads, high prices, limited skills base and other minus points. Without wishing to add to Aberdeen's woes, our Far North corre spondent reports on an, er, complicating factor in the local labour market. His day job is with a rig supply firm and he was recently called upon to hire 15 teenage cadets to work the supply ships, offering good pay, good prospects, training and so forth. Fifteen likely lads were chosen and told to report the next day after a routine medical. Just three turned up; the others had failed the drugs test.
No danger of that down in the Square Mile, it seems, where the incredible shrinking City lunch is now down to 45 minutes, according to the Singapura eatery group. That's hardly time for a Tiger, let alone a meal, which may be why some shrewd operators are cramming in two client lunches back to back. Singapura is unfazed: `South-east Asian cuisine is entirely suited to these tight timeframes.' Oh yes? Somerset Maugham's mobile number, anyone?
Still out east (sort of) and the Countess of Wessex ought to take heart; all this carping about the unseemliness of her business activities is profoundly un-historical. The magnificent royal house of Byzantium was one in which, National Geographic recounted in December 1983, `trade or industry seldom bore a stigma'. The emperor Justinian `founded its famed silk industry' and, more pertinent, perhaps, to the Countess's situation: `One empress distilled perfume in her palace bedroom.' Now that's what we call an enterprise culture.
And this is what we call the excreta of an uncircumcised ox, courtesy of Unilever chairman Niall FitzGerald on Tuesday, explaining the company's restructuring has involved `a move away from a local market-dominated organisation to a more balanced, multi-local multi- national structure'. Oh, quite, hear hear.

Abstract: A new vehicle excise duty system may class cars in four bands according their emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2 ), the so-called greenhouse gas. Industry sources and unofficial leaks suggest that the bands would be GBP 100 for a car such as a Nissan Micra 1-litre, GBP 175 for a Vauxhall Astra 1.6, GBP 250 for Ford Focus or BMW 1.8 and GBP 475 for Audi A6 2.8 or any car with a larger engine.

Full text:   COMPANY car drivers and fleet managers face an uncertain future as the government dithers over harsh new road tax plans.
The changes, expected to come into force in October 2000, are unlikely to revealed until the March Budget, making it impossible for managers and drivers to plan buying policies.
A new vehicle excise duty system may class cars in four bands according their emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2 ), the so-called greenhouse gas.
The system is expected to apply only to new cars.
Industry sources and unofficial leaks suggest that the bands would be GBP 100 for a car such as a Nissan Micra 1-litre, GBP 175 for a Vauxhall Astra 1.6, GBP 250 for Ford Focus or BMW 1.8 and GBP 475 for Audi A6 2.8 or any car with a larger engine.
The AA says that the plan for tiered road tax is based on arguments that do not stand up to scrutiny.
Bert Morris, the AA's public policy manager, says: 'The impact on CO2 reduction will be small because most people cannot drive less, and it won't be seen as fair by most motorists.
'The government's consultation paper climate change admits the impact will be small.
'Given this, it is impossible to justify changing a well known, easily under- stood system for one that will baffle motorists, skew the car market and waste millions of pounds of taxpayers' money trying to implement it.' One obvious weakness of the scheme is that similar kinds of vehicles are likely to be in the same groups, giving buyers no incentive to switch.
But it is not known whether exhaust pollutants other than CO2 such as oxides of nitrogen and, in diesels, soot particles will be considered.
Diesel fuel produces low amounts of CO2 . Liquid petroleum gas (LPG) produces relatively high amounts though it is considered overall to be a cleaner fuel.
Fleet managers have been buying fewer diesel cars because of pollution worries and fears that the government is ready to penalise 'dirty' diesel in changes to taxation for company car drivers. A 3% penalty has been mooted.
There are also worries that duty on diesel will be further increased ahead of petrol, despite protests from the road haulage industry and other users that the fuel is already too expensive.
British lorry operators are at a huge financial disadvantage on diesel compared with Continental rivals.
And the government's intentions do not take account of recent technical developments in diesel engines and pollution filters.
Peugeot has spent GBP 40 million on a revolutionary filter for its new 607 executive model, for example, which it says will destroy even microscopic exhaust particles.
And recently the trade magazine Fleet News reported industry experts, including AA chief engineer David Lang, claiming controversially that environmental improvements to diesel and petrol could mean the death of gas-fuelled vehicles within five years.
Meanwhile, the corporate car culture in which workers strive to have the biggest or most impressive model in the car park is being consigned to history.
Pressure is growing for firms to make use of trains, buses and email as well as company cars to ease road congestion and pollution and to conserve resources. Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrats' transport and environment spokesman, says that firms must start thinking now about the cars they will be using in five years and how staff will use them without inviting stiff financial penalties.
But Taylor believes that the company car will continue to play an important role in British business, not least in providing tens of thousands of jobs in the UK car industry.
Meanwhile, vehicle management companies and recruitment firms dispute suggestions by benefits analysts that the company car is losing its appeal as a perk.
Company car drivers, it is claimed, are starting to prefer better pensions, private health schemes, more holidays and improved insurance benefits.
In a recent survey by benefits adviser Gissings, 40% of employees based in south-east England felt that a company car was 'totally unimportant'.
Some 54% of London-based staff would rather have a season ticket loan, though 43% of workers in Birmingham, Leeds, Newcastle and Liverpool and 40% of those in Bristol and Somerset were interested in a company car.
But Shankar Ramanathan, marketing director of British Car Contracts, said that company cars or cash options are still crucial factors in attracting and keeping staff.
In the past six months there has been a big move out of direct company car schemes and into personal contract plans (PCPs) in which employees own their cars but have reduced tax liability.
Employees covering 20,000 miles a year or more expect company cars as part of salary packages but other employees look for something more flexible.

SUVs: Views from both sides of the road: Big sports-utility vehicles like are rarely driven off road and they contribute far more to air pollution than cars because they don't have to meet emissions standards, an environmental group officer argues.: [Final Edition]

Abstract: Because SUVs and minivans are classified as light trucks, they don't have to meet the same fuel-efficiency standards as passenger vehicles (cars) -- even though that's how the majority of them are used. The BCAA says the solution is improving driving behaviour through education, not hiding drivers behind larger vehicles. This is an interesting message just as the mother of all SUVs -- Ford's new 19- foot (5.8-metre) Excursion that weighs in at 3.2 ton (3,200 kg) -- hits the road. Even the most ardent environmentalists, however, recognize that SUVs and minivans are here to stay. What's needed, they say, are regulations to make them safer, cleaner and more fuel efficient. Car buyers must also evaluate their vehicle needs to determine if they really need an SUV or a minivan, says Chris Rolfe of West Coast Environmental Law.

Full text: Kerrisdale resident Dave McLaughlin fits the profile of most urban sport-utility-vehicle drivers. He's a 30-something sports enthusiast who likes the power of his forest-green Jeep Grand Cherokee. McLaughlin, however, hardly ever takes his SUV into the forest. The only time his jeep leaves paved road is once or twice a year when he goes fishing near his parents' home in Kelowna. "I like the big engine, but the cost of operating it is a drag," he said of the price to fill the large gas tank. "It's not very practical for the city. My next vehicle will be a car."
They may not be practical, cheap or affordable to run, but SUVs, minivans and light trucks are a popular choice for city drivers even though most of them never leave the open road.
And because SUVs and minivans are classified as light trucks, they don't have to meet the same fuel-efficiency standards as passenger vehicles (cars) -- even though that's how the majority of them are used.
Vehicles are among the largest users of fossil fuels. And the burning of fossil fuels is the biggest contributor to air pollution and the release of greenhouse gases, which has led to increased global warming and climate change.
In the Lower Mainland, SUVs, minivans and light trucks release between 25 to 175 per cent more emissions of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons than regular cars, according to a 1998 Greater
Vancouver Regional District air quality report. And with an average of 30,000 new cars and trucks on Lower Mainland roads each year, it's clear that our air is only going to get worse.
In response, the B.C. Automobile Association is petitioning government to reduce fuel emissions through tougher vehicle fuel efficiency standards.
BCAA president Bill Bullis wrote in this newspaper last November that in 1981, the federal government passed the Motor Vehicle Fuel Consumption Standards Act which would require auto manufacturers to meet increasingly tougher fuel efficiency standards over a period of time. But 17 years later, the act still hasn't been proclaimed law.
Canadians must lobby their politicians for change since this is clearly a political, not a technological, problem, the BCAA advocates.
SUV drivers also cite safety as another reason they like their big vehicles.
While you're more likely to fare better in a SUV if you crash, your chances of being involved in a fatal rollover are much higher than in a car, says the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a U.S. non-profit group.
The U.S. single-vehicle rollover death rate in small utility vehicles was more than seven times as high as the rate in the largest cars (124 deaths per million registered vehicles versus 16) in 1997, according to the IIHS.
Single-vehicle rollover crashes accounted for 50 per cent of occupant deaths in utility vehicles in 1997 compared with 34 per cent of deaths in pickups and 18 per cent in cars, they report.
The BCAA says the solution is improving driving behaviour through education, not hiding drivers behind larger vehicles. This is an interesting message just as the mother of all SUVs -- Ford's new 19- foot (5.8-metre) Excursion that weighs in at 3.2 ton (3,200 kg) -- hits the road.
Even the most ardent environmentalists, however, recognize that SUVs and minivans are here to stay. What's needed, they say, are regulations to make them safer, cleaner and more fuel efficient. Car buyers must also evaluate their vehicle needs to determine if they really need an SUV or a minivan, says Chris Rolfe of West Coast Environmental Law.
In numerous articles about the Excursion, Ford officials say they are just meeting consumer demand. Rolfe disagrees.
"Vehicle manufacturers are pushing people to buy luxury trucks and SUVs because they're more profitable and subject to less stringent emissions and safety standards," he said.
Like the Clean Air Alliance and BCAA, Rolfe says mandatory fuel- efficiency standards must apply to all cars and trucks equally so that all Canadian vehicles will be cleaner.
Jean Kavanagh is a Vancouver writer who works in communications for the David Suzuki Foundation, a science-based environmental research organization.

Full text: You deserve congratulations for exposing the activities of one of Britain's most powerful and yet most secretive official agencies, the ECGD. Mr Byers' decision to ignore official advice and pump yet more funding into Indonesia shows how ECGD assistance is offered in ways that are often contradictory to wider government policy. If the national audit office decides to investigate ECGD operations, it will be the fourth review to be announced since July. An internal ECGD review is already underway, and two Commons select committees are also investigating.{QQ}
The questions all these reviews need to address are fundamental. Is it logical for the UK to promote stronger free trade rules and international competition whilst at the same time dishing out multi- million pound subsidies to help British firms export to developing countries? Industries in developing countries have no such advantage. Also, since ECGD finance is the source of most of the debts owed to Britain by developing nations, why is it possible for ECGD to increase that debt by granting insurance for risky ventures when the UK says it leads debt forgiveness programmes? Whilst the threat of climate change looms ever larger, should the ECGD not be doing more to promote the export of solar and other clean power sources instead of yet more coal-powered stations?{QQ}
The ECGD must set standards for human rights and sustainable development and seek to promote those companies and industries that are achieving them. Otherwise it will continue to deserve our designation as the least green branch of government.{QQ}

Abstract: Deadly, costly weather events in the Midwest are increasing -- not because of climate change but because humans are more vulnerable than ever to heat waves, floods and other extremes. This finding is important because it challenges the claims by some scientists and politicians, including Vice President Al Gore. Weather catastrophes in the 1990s show that global warming has triggered climate change, they claim. Other scientists and politicians argue that such catastrophes are part of normal climate variation in the Midwest. The new studies were conducted by Changnon and Kenneth Kunkel of the climate center; Roger Pielke Jr., of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in Boulder, Colo.; and Changnon's son, David Changnon, of Northern Illinois University, in Dekalb.

Full text: Deadly, costly weather events in the Midwest are increasing -- not because of climate change but because humans are more vulnerable than ever to heat waves, floods and other extremes.
That's the conclusion of three recently completed studies of regional weather by the Midwestern Climate Center.
"The weather isn't changing -- society is," said Stanley Changnon, one of the scientists who conducted the studies at the center, in Champaign, Ill.
This finding is important because it challenges the claims by some scientists and politicians, including Vice President Al Gore. Weather catastrophes in the 1990s show that global warming has triggered climate change, they claim. Other scientists and politicians argue that such catastrophes are part of normal climate variation in the Midwest.
The new studies were conducted by Changnon and Kenneth Kunkel of the climate center; Roger Pielke Jr., of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in Boulder, Colo.; and Changnon's son, David Changnon, of Northern Illinois University, in Dekalb.
The climatologists studied the frequency, costs and fatalities associated with droughts, heat waves, floods, winter storms and other weather hazards in the Midwest since 1900.
The 1990s have seen the most costly and deadly weather events in the Midwest's history, Stanley Changnon said in an interview last week. Among them:
* The flood of 1993, which caused losses of $6 billion in Iowa, $5 billion in Missouri and $1.4 billion in Illinois.
* Heat waves in 1995 and 1999 that killed hundreds of people in Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri.
* The tornado invasion of Illinois in 1998, when the state led the nation with 123 twisters.
The scientists cited property insurance data that compared weather catastrophes for the region. From 1950 to 1990, an average of two weather catastrophes struck per year. From 1990 to 1996, such events occurred at a rate of five per year.
"There is no doubt the losses are growing rapidly," Changnon said.
Most people Changnon has talked with believe society has worked hard over the past century to avoid weather disasters. Air conditioning is widespread in homes, businesses and vehicles. Farmers rely on new technology to overcome heavy rain and drought. Deaths caused by tornadoes, floods and winter storms have declined, mainly because of better forecasts.
But population growth and lifestyle changes have increased losses in other categories.
"The ever-expanding metropolitan areas surrounding Chicago and St. Louis contain a high density of structures and vehicles where huge losses occur, even from small-scale yet intense rain, hail or tornadic storms," he said.
Heat waves of the 1990s represent more of a threat than in the 1930s, when summer temperatures were worse, Changnon said. He cited the Chicago heat waves of 1995 and 1999, which caused more deaths than those in 1934 and 1936.
"Many who died in 1995 and 1999 were elderly, living alone, without air conditioning - or without the resources to pay for its continuous operation - in locked homes with windows closed and secured," he said. "In 1936, many older people lived with their families. And a common practice to keep cool on hot summer nights was to sleep outside, often in city parks - a practice that would be life- threatening in today's urban world."
The Midwest economy is increasingly vulnerable to bad weather. That's particularly true for the region's trucking and rail lines, which are at the heart of the national transportation system.
The scientists said Midwesterners should be concerned about the possibility of climate changes, since this could increase losses.
They recommended stronger measures to avoid losses, "including assuming greater personal responsibility for where and how we choose to live."
The research was funded by the Midwestern Climate Center, a research group supported by the Illinois and federal governments.

Abstract: An editorial argues that the encephalitis that has resulted in several deaths in New York City should not have come as a surprise to anyone if they had bothered to read the book "The Regional Impact of Climate Change."

Full text: Three people have died from mosquito-borne Saint Louis encephalitis (SLE) in New York, and another 60 are suspected of having contracted the disease. Public health officials appear astonished by the appearance of the disease in such a northern city, and in their search for an explanation to satisfy alarmed New Yorkers referred to heavy rainfalls and high temperatures. But this crisis should not have been a surprise to anyone; it was predicted in a book which should be required reading in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn: The Regional Impact of Climate Change, produced by the inter- governmental panel on climate change in 1998.{QQ}
Yesterday there were reports of two cases of malaria in New York. Both SLE and malaria in the north-eastern US are evidence of the gathering pace of environmental change from global warming. We had thought one of the triumphs of the 20th century was the eradication of malaria in most of the developed world; the 21st century will see its return. Florida is now spending pounds 100m a year on combating malaria. A report last week claimed that within a decade, the disease will be common again on the Spanish coast. The effects of global warming are coming home to roost in the developed world. Yesterday, New York city workers were handing out insect repellent to commuters, but a more effective long-term way of combating the disease would be to hand out a summary of the inter-governmental panel's terrifying conclusions. SLE is the least of it - given the US experience of tropical diseases and its pioneering federal centre for disease control - but there are other effects of global warming, such as hurricanes, floods, heatwaves and droughts, which will cost thousands of lives, and cause havoc over the next century on the economies of some US regions such as the Great Plains, not to mention the insurance industry.{QQ}
Americans and their politicians need this truth to be brought home to them because no country has contributed as much to global warming as the US, and, at the same time, done so much to block international efforts to address the problem. The US is responsible for 25% of the world's production of carbon dioxide, yet the government, leaned on by the coal, oil and automobile industries, has shown little will to cut that figure. At present it is at risk of overshooting its target of a 6% cut by around 30%. Americans need to sit up and take notice; they are using up global resources to which they have no right. They may have the wealth to protect themselves from some of the effects of global warming, but much of the rest of the world which will be hit even harder, has not. The US is stockpiling an environmental debt to the world which will have terrible consequences on the lives of millions, from El Nino in Latin America, to famines in the Horn of Africa and floods in Bangladesh. A few deaths in Manhattan might drive this point home. {QQ}

Abstract: The carbon war Jeremy Leggett Penguin, #20 Jeremy Leggett's account of the awakening of the world to the catastrophic consequences of our continued burning of fossil fuel reserves is subtitled Dispatches from the End of the Oil Century. That essentially captures both the form and the philosophical position which equally limit and inform his book. It is the diary of a geologist who worked as an academic and consultant for major oil companies before finding his training of the future hunters for oil increasingly untenable in the face of reports of global warming. A job vacancy for a scientist to give technical advice to Greenpeace campaigners was his chance to align his professional knowledge with increasing personal conviction. Other academics with this brief might have remained the back room boffin, translating scientific terms into layman's language and writing the facts and figures into press releases, but Leggett's active role ensured him a ringside seat during 10 years of intense negotiations among some of the most powerful political and economic forces in the world. His conscientious reportage of meetings invites the danger of tedium but the strict chronology reveals the shifts in position and alliances. Like any war correspondent, he is largely restricted to the theatre of the big set pieces, but like the best, he talks to as many different interests as possible and vastly broadens our understanding.

Like any war correspondent, he is largely restricted to the theatre of the big set pieces, but like the best, he talks to as many different interests as possible and vastly broadens our understanding.
For the unscientific, this account of events from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change set up by the United Nations in 1988, to the summit in Kyoto, Japan in 1997, is a revelation. Suddenly the apparently contradictory nature of so much we have heard and read falls into place: it's not the scientists who are disagreeing, except for taking account of known variables; it's the vested interests.
While he doesn't abseil down public buildings in a boiler suit, Jeremy Leggett employs plenty of guerilla tactics his direct action colleagues in Greenpeace would be proud of. His speciality is getting press passes to the heart of the highest level international conferences: like the 1993 G7 meeting in Tokyo. As it happened, the economic correspondents found the environmental arguments irrelevant or had them deleted. Yet the real argument was no longer environmental, but financial.
Leggett's most significant realisation is that he has to switch targets from the oil, gas and coal companies to the financial sector: the insurers who are going to find themselves paying out for the damage wrought by the typhoons, hurricanes, floods, and droughts liable to increase as a result of global warming. By 1994, he was being invited to address conferences of international bankers on the prospects for their much longer-term commitments.
His task was to convince them that in 15 or 30 years their investments in coal-fired power stations or oil exploration would be subject not just to market economics, but also to governmental response to public reaction to global warming: carbon taxes, for example.
The most obvious comparison, not for the first time in the history of the carbon war, is with the tobacco industry. In the future, for example, we should perhaps expect class actions by victims to be launched against those who facilitated acts of greenhouse-gas profligacy in the years after the warning issued in the IPCC's First Scientific Assessment in 1990.
In October 1996 BP "quietly let it be known that it was quitting the Global Climate Coalition." This major crack in the solidarity of the carbon club was the result of embarrassment at the GCC's extreme behaviour in attacking the IPCC's science.
It is the significant splinter, which leads, after much battling, to a last-minute agreement at Kyoto to an overall reduction target in greenhouse gases of 5.2% for the industrialised countries. That is the coup de grce which ends the account of the carbon war, but the geologist turned lobbyist has a new mission: to fund the technology of the new age.
Finally, too, he has found the answer to the question which stumped him three years earlier when asked by an official of the Chartered Insurance Institute: "Given the magnitude of the things that need to be done . . . why are you still optimistic?" Having charted the battle lost by "the unrepentant thugs of the corporate world," he declares: "The solar revolution is coming. It is now inevitable. The only question left unanswered is, will it come in time?"

Abstract: Government plans for an energy tax could pull the plug on many farm businesses already struggling to survive a disastrous collapse in prices and incomes.

Full text: Government plans for an energy tax could pull the plug on many farm businesses already struggling to survive a disastrous collapse in prices and incomes.
The warning was given yesterday by the Country Landowners Association.
The association has protested that the proposed levy will discriminate against UK agriculture, and threaten jobs and incomes, at a time when the industry is burdened by the worst recession for 60 years.
Aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases from the consumption of fossil fuels, the levy should only be adopted as part of the European-wide strategy to curb global warming, says the association.
This, it claims, would protect UK farming against the risk of unfair competition resulting from increased costs.
The association has also urged that some of the cash yielded by the energy tax should be devoted to minimising its impact on farming and other primary production, and funding the development of renewable energy sources.
It is also keen for other methods of reducing greenhouse gases to be used as alternative options to imposing a potentially damaging energy levy.
The association's Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Gloucestershire regional director Mr Geoffrey Hopton said: "The CLA represents many members whose land is threatened by future flooding because of the effects of global warming.
"We also represent many rural businesses that will be seriously affected by climate change.
"The association is keen to see that any energy tax is introduced fairly and at the same time that a positive programme to address the effects of increased greenhouse gases and climate change is delivered.
"But if a UK levy is to be introduced, the Government must also address its impact on our agricultural sector.
"This will be vital to avoid further damage to an already depressed industry, leading to bankruptcy, unemployment and a reduced ability by land managers to maintain an attractive countryside as demanded by the public.
He said the planned energy levy would have a disproportionate effect on agriculture in general. The proposal to recycle the levy to make it neutral to employers through employers' national insurance contributions would discriminate heavily againstfarming of all kinds.
Agriculture was an intensive energy user compared with the amount of employment it generated.
In addition to field operations using large horsepower tractors, temperature controlled crop stores and many areas of livestock production were likely to suffer greatly.
Intensive horticulture operations, leading contributors to the balance of payments, may be put out of business. Unlike other forms of industrial production, the areas for energy saving within agriculture were limited.
Mr Hopton said: "The association believes that any unilateral UK levy will have an unfair impact on our agriculture and other primary production.
"If a levy is required, it must be introduced on an EU-wide basis to safeguard UK economic interests by ensuring that all our major trading partners are subject to the same costs."
Mr Hopton said if the energy tax was introduced, the association wanted to see any cash surplus to the proposed national insurance rebate spent on helping to reduce its excessive effects on primary producers, and investment in developing renewableenergy.
The association says renewable energy enterprises should also be exempt from the levy.

CBI chief condemns plans for energy tax: [1 Edition]

Abstract: "The tax could be so large in relation to the expected reductions in national insurance it will reduce the amount of money firms have to improve their energy efficiency - surely a counter-productive move," said [Andrew Dewar-Durie]. "It can also be punitive - examples show sectors receiving back 5% or less of what they pay in the levy through reduced NI contributions." Firms across the UK are already working to meet the CO2 targets set down at the Kyoto Convention on climate change in 1997. But Dewar-Durie believes there are more cost-effective ways to tackle the problem. The CBI is supporting negotiated agreements and emissions trading - where companies cutting emissions to below their own target can sell the extra to firms struggling to meet theirs.

Full text:   THE chairman of CBI Scotland has urged the government to think again about its energy tax proposals which he claims will hit Scottish manufacturing.
Andrew Dewar-Durie agrees Scotland needs to become more energy efficient to combat global warming, but he claims the biggest users of energy will be penalised unfairly by the plans.
The government's proposals centre around a plan to impose a climate change levy on companies - the so-called energy tax - which it says will be "revenue neutral" across the economy. Funds raised this way will be offset by reduced national insurance contributions.
"The tax could be so large in relation to the expected reductions in national insurance it will reduce the amount of money firms have to improve their energy efficiency - surely a counter-productive move," said Dewar-Durie. "It can also be punitive - examples show sectors receiving back 5% or less of what they pay in the levy through reduced NI contributions."
Firms across the UK are already working to meet the CO2 targets set down at the Kyoto Convention on climate change in 1997. But Dewar-Durie believes there are more cost-effective ways to tackle the problem. The CBI is supporting negotiated agreements and emissions trading - where companies cutting emissions to below their own target can sell the extra to firms struggling to meet theirs.
Dewar-Durie also claimed the levy could end up putting people out of jobs.
Caledonian Paper in Irvine, for example, estimates it faces a potential tax bill of around #2 million a year after taking into account the reductions in NI contributions. Its sister company in North Wales, Shotton Paper, faces an estimated #7 million bill.
Commercial director Chris Robinson said: "While we support strongly the government's Kyoto commitments, the levy in its present form will be grievously damaging to our competitiveness. In the international market for our product, it is impossible for us to recover the tax in our selling price.
"If the government is serious about tackling global warming it needs to look at the whole picture. We believe the Kyoto targets can be met without damaging job prospects or hitting wealth creation in Scotland.
"The government has got it wrong with these proposals and needs to think again."

Solar power pioneer aims to make others see the light: MY BIG BREAK JEREMY LEGGETT: The former Greenpeace campaigner proved the technology can work and now he has high hopes for his company. Vanessa Houlder reports: [London edition]

Abstract: Jeremy Leggett, environmental campaigner turned entrepreneur, used to be accused of pessimism. As the scientist in charge of Greenpeace's global warming campaign, he spent years warning a sceptical world about the dangers of climate change. But Mr Leggett has done more to change attitudes towards the resource than almost any other individual. After years struggling to promote it, he can claim to have put it firmly on the map this year. The turning point was his decision to demonstrate the technology in an ordinary terraced house. The announcement that he had installed solar panels on the roof of his home in Richmond, Surrey, was something of a breakthrough in the public relations battle for the power source. No longer, explains Mr Leggett, could the doubters argue that it would not work in the UK.

Full text: Jeremy Leggett, environmental campaigner turned entrepreneur, used to be accused of pessimism. As the scientist in charge of Greenpeace's global warming campaign, he spent years warning a sceptical world about the dangers of climate change.
Now he is more likely to be accused of the opposite sentiment. He is convinced that solar power can become an important means of generating electricity, even under the gloomy skies of Britain.
Once again, he has picked an unpopular cause. Scepticism over solar power is, if anything, even greater than that encountered over global warming.
But Mr Leggett has done more to change attitudes towards the resource than almost any other individual. After years struggling to promote it, he can claim to have put it firmly on the map this year.
The turning point was his decision to demonstrate the technology in an ordinary terraced house. The announcement that he had installed solar panels on the roof of his home in Richmond, Surrey, was something of a breakthrough in the public relations battle for the power source. No longer, explains Mr Leggett, could the doubters argue that it would not work in the UK.
The roof generated 68 per cent more power than the household needed.
A typical day provides electricity for 350 cups of tea, 70 TV programmes and 800 slices of toast. The panels are expected over their lifetime to prevent more than 30 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions - playing a small but significant role in the struggle against global warming.
"We have had an incredible response," he says. "I am absolutely convinced the market will take off. It is just a matter of time."
He is so convinced that in March he set up a company to tap latent demand. Solar Century promotes the energy source and acts as a distributor for several manufacturers of solar panels.
The transition from environmentalist to entrepreneur has not been smooth. The idea behind Solar Century, launched in a different guise in 1996, was somewhat different.
During his last three years at Greenpeace Mr Leggett worked with insurance companies worried about the impact of global warming on their underwriting business.
Could they, he wondered, see the logic of supporting the embryonic solar industry? Market volumes could be built - and the price of the energy source could be brought down - if the companies could be persuaded to undertake solar projects.
This idea of a "global buyers' club" failed to take off - as many of Mr Leggett's business-minded friends had warned. Now the company has been re-invented on a more commercial basis, although it intends to channel some profits into a charitable trust.
The company's first direct marketing mailshot, aimed at architects, has had a 28 per cent response rate. The first panels are due to be installed in the autumn for customers ranging from individuals requiring remote sources of power to companies seeking to learn more about a pioneering tech-nology.
But it may not be plain sailing. Sceptics point to the setbacks since the oil crisis of the 1970s, which triggered a flurry of interest in solar power.
So what has changed? Technological advances have improved its prospects. Mr Leggett's amorphous silicon roof tiles - made by United Solar, a Michigan-based engineering company - have an efficiency in converting sunlight to electricity of 8 per cent, well above levels achievable a few years ago.
Mr Leggett's confidence does not lie with the chances of further improvements but rather with the impact mass manufacturing could have on price. At about £10,000 per kW - about 16.5 sq m - the photovoltaic tiles appeal only to niche markets.
He says that if the output of panel manufacturing plants, which currently produce 10MW a year, could increase ten-fold, the price of solar power would be reduced to that of coal-powered power stations.
But companies would need evidence of demand before investing in a plant that would cost at least $100m.
"The issue today is really marketing," says Mr Leggett. "It is the 4Ms - marketing, marketing, marketing and management. Not technology. That exists."
Mr Leggett compares solar power with technologies such as mobile phones and microprocessors when considering its potential growth. But he accepts that the take-up is not inevitable, not least because the fossil fuel industry will defend the status quo.
Mr Leggett has not completely turned his back on his campaigning days. He recently published a book on the battle for an international treaty on climate change. But now his anxiety is tempered by his enthusiasm for solar power. "This revolution is definitely possible," he says. "I am a qualified optimist."

Global warming proof still suspect: [National Edition 1]

Author: Singer, S Fred

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/global-warming-proof-still-suspect/docview/329626469/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Many of Dr. [Andrew Weaver]'s arguments are easily disposed of. If 1998 was the warmest year and 1999 is cooler, does that mean that the globe is cooling? One year does not make a trend. We all agree that there was substantial warming between 1900 and 1940. This warming marked the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA), which began around 1000 AD. But let's be honest. We had no global temperature measurements until weather satellites started regular observations in 1979. The reconstructions published by Michael Mann are based on proxy data such as the width of tree rings, and fail to even document the LIA; other researchers get quite different results. For example, Dorthe Dahl-Jensen and her colleagues, who used data from thermometers in bore holes of Greenland ice cores, clearly showed the LIA and the warming before 1940 (Science, Oct. 9, 1998). The authors remark explicitly that temperatures fell between 1940 and 1995. as I pointed out in my article, when we analyze sea-level data on a time scale of decades rather than millennia, we find that this long-term rise decreases markedly during a warming period (for example, between 1900 and 1940). The warming causes more evaporation from oceans, hence more global rainfall, and therefore more (short- term) ice accumulation on the Antarctic continent. Apparently, this transfer of water from the ocean to continental ice outweighs the effects of the melting mountain glaciers that raise sea levels. So it is all a matter of time scale. Any man-made (or natural) warming over the next century will slow down the inexorable rise of sea levels.

Full text: S. Fred Singer, PhD, is an atmospheric physicist, professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia, and president of the Fairfax-based Science & Environmental Policy Project, a non-profit policy institute.
As a lead author of the 1995 UN-IPCC climate report, Andrew Weaver understandably downplays its scientific uncertainties. Many of his IPCC colleagues are not so sanguine. The prestigious journal Science (May 16, 1997) interviewed IPCC participants and got rather skeptical reactions to the IPCC's conclusions. It's therefore disingenuous of Dr. Weaver to accuse scientific skeptics of pursuing an industry agenda while considering government bureaucracies to be free of hidden motives. For the record, my organization, the Science and Environmental Policy Project, is supported entirely by private donations and non-profit foundations.
This is not the place to enter into a detailed scientific debate. My arguments are spelled out in my recent book, Hot Talk, Cold Science: Global Warming's Unfinished Debate and on our Web site.
However, many of Dr. Weaver's arguments are easily disposed of. If 1998 was the warmest year and 1999 is cooler, does that mean that the globe is cooling? One year does not make a trend. We all agree that there was substantial warming between 1900 and 1940. This warming marked the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA), which began around 1000 AD. But let's be honest. We had no global temperature measurements until weather satellites started regular observations in 1979. The reconstructions published by Michael Mann are based on proxy data such as the width of tree rings, and fail to even document the LIA; other researchers get quite different results. For example, Dorthe Dahl-Jensen and her colleagues, who used data from thermometers in bore holes of Greenland ice cores, clearly showed the LIA and the warming before 1940 (Science, Oct. 9, 1998). The authors remark explicitly that temperatures fell between 1940 and 1995.
Dr. Weaver is not quite up-to-date on the analysis of satellite data. Even after corrections, they still show no sustained warming trend in the past 20 years. Quite independently, balloon-borne radiosondes give similar results. Climate modellers are trying to fit their computer results to the data by introducing questionable corrections (or forcings) from various aerosols, stratospheric ozone, and so on. I consider these efforts to be little more than curve- fitting exercises. As global warming guru James Hansen of NASA, who wrote last year in the Proceedings of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences: "The forcings that drive long-term climate change are not known with an accuracy sufficient to define future climate change."
I can clarify the sea-level issue that is puzzling Dr. Weaver. He is correct in stating that sea levels were 120 metres lower some 20,000 years ago and have been rising steadily since then, the peak of the last ice age. Sea levels will continue to rise as more of the remaining polar ice melts, especially in the Antarctic ice sheets. If our present warm interglacial period continues for a few more millennia, sea levels may rise another 10 metres, and we can do nothing about it.
But, as I pointed out in my article, when we analyze sea-level data on a time scale of decades rather than millennia, we find that this long-term rise decreases markedly during a warming period (for example, between 1900 and 1940). The warming causes more evaporation from oceans, hence more global rainfall, and therefore more (short- term) ice accumulation on the Antarctic continent. Apparently, this transfer of water from the ocean to continental ice outweighs the effects of the melting mountain glaciers that raise sea levels. So it is all a matter of time scale. Any man-made (or natural) warming over the next century will slow down the inexorable rise of sea levels.
As an aside, I find it strange that Dr. Weaver, who is so skeptical about the profit-seeking fossil-fuel industry, is so open to the arguments of the profit-seeking insurance industry. Could the reason be that they support his global warming fears? We should recognize their climate change arguments as self-serving, as they try to squeeze higher rates out of government regulators. In fact, hurricanes have been diminishing in frequency and intensity over the past 50 years, according to the UN-IPCC report. Population growth and increased investment, not global warming, have caused higher insurance losses.
To sum up, the crucial question is whether climate models can reproduce observations. So far at least, they have not only failed to do so, but their predictions differ from each other by several hundred percent.
Until climate models are reasonably well validated, we cannot accept their predictions, nor base far-reaching and costly policies on them. Under the circumstances, we should follow economically sound, "no-regrets" policies, such as cost-effective investments in energy conservation.

Abstract: First, I don't understand Dr. [S. Fred Singer]'s suspicion of government- funded scientists, nor his criticism of the climate change information on Environment Canada's Web site. Conspiracies require a motive, and I can't fathom what advantage would accrue from a government plot of climate change misinformation. Though I escape Dr. Singer's criticism because I am not a government scientist, I know that most basic research is by necessity government-funded -- and is peer reviewed before funding. I would like to clarify Dr. Singer's assertion that a warming trend recorded by ground instruments is not borne out by data from satellites. Dr. Singer is right that a discrepancy in ground/satellite trends did cause confusion -- until researchers corrected errors in satellite orbital calculations. Once corrected, the satellite and ground data both showed warming trends. Nonetheless, these satellite data are still at an experimental stage. And while Dr. Singer is correct that urban environments are relatively warm, he failed to mention that rural temperature instruments, especially those in sparsely populated, high northern latitudes, also reveal a warming trend. Dr. Singer says the effects of climate change would be, on the whole, positive. I counter that scientists lack the ability to predict definitively how global warming will affect regional climates and extreme weather events, or what major climate surprises might be in store. So it surprises me that any economic analysis, which must make assumptions on all of these, is possible at all.

Full text: Dr. Andrew Weaver is a professor at the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of Victoria. He was a Steacie Fellow and a lead author of reports by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
As a climate scientist, I was taken aback by "New Heat on Global Warming" (Aug. 7) by S. Fred Singer, who advocates postponing action on climate change until the scientific picture is much clearer. While I won't presume to dictate policy, the scientific consensus is far more clear than Dr. Singer suggests.
First, I don't understand Dr. Singer's suspicion of government- funded scientists, nor his criticism of the climate change information on Environment Canada's Web site. Conspiracies require a motive, and I can't fathom what advantage would accrue from a government plot of climate change misinformation. Though I escape Dr. Singer's criticism because I am not a government scientist, I know that most basic research is by necessity government-funded -- and is peer reviewed before funding.
I do not subscribe to Dr. Singer's claim that "governments are unlikely to fund researchers who are not already concerned about global warming." On the other hand, I know industry-funded research is usually aimed at a corporate mission.
An overwhelming body of evidence points to significant warming over the past century, including tree ring analyses by Michael Mann and colleagues that reconstruct northern temperatures during the past 1,000 years. They show a dramatic increase in Northern Hemisphere temperatures at the turn of this century. In the 1,000-year record, 1998 represented the warmest year, the 1990s the warmest decade and the 20th century the warmest century.
While Dr. Singer correctly notes that natural oscillations play a significant role in determining climate, data analyzed by paleoclimatologist Jonathan Overpeck of the National Atmospheric and Ocean Administration have failed to identify any natural mechanism for the unprecedented warming that led to 1998 being the warmest year in at least the past 1,200.
Dr. Singer argues that, so far, natural climate variability appears to dominate over any human effect. Simon Tett and colleagues of the prestigious Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research disagree. In their paper published recently in the journal Nature, the authors exclude purely natural causes for warming from 1946 to 1996, and attribute it largely to human factors.
Reaffirming these results, Mike Lockwood of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in England told New Scientist magazine, "Whatever has happened in the past, the greenhouse effect is now the dominant cause of warming." Referring to his research published recently in Nature, Dr. Lockwood said that since 1970, when the pace of climate change began to accelerate, solar changes have caused less than one- third of the observed warming.
These and numerous other recent reports support and strengthen the 1995 United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change statement that the balance of evidence suggests a discernible climate change due to human activities. As James Hansen of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies says, "the rapid warming of the past 25 years undercuts the argument of the 'greenhouse skeptics' who have maintained that most global warming occurred early this century when greenhouse gases were increasing more slowly -- in fact, the fastest warming is occurring just when it is expected."
I would like to clarify Dr. Singer's assertion that a warming trend recorded by ground instruments is not borne out by data from satellites. Dr. Singer is right that a discrepancy in ground/satellite trends did cause confusion -- until researchers corrected errors in satellite orbital calculations. Once corrected, the satellite and ground data both showed warming trends. Nonetheless, these satellite data are still at an experimental stage. And while Dr. Singer is correct that urban environments are relatively warm, he failed to mention that rural temperature instruments, especially those in sparsely populated, high northern latitudes, also reveal a warming trend.
I am puzzled by Dr. Singer's statement that "ongoing sea-level rise slows during warmer periods." If this were true, then it follows that sea-level rise would increase during cool periods. It is now well known that 21,000 years ago, when much of Canada lay frozen under a vast ice sheet and global temperatures were about 5C lower, sea levels were about 120 metres lower. The scientific research on current trends shows that the total sum of glacier and ice sheet melting is causing the sea to rise. Best estimates of sea-level rise by 2100 are 50 centimetres.
As for Dr. Singer's reference to the 17,000-plus scientists who signed the petition last year against the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, I would add that the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, on one of whose boards I serve, took the unprecedented step of disassociating itself from this petition. The academy concluded that "greenhouse warming poses a potential threat sufficient to merit prompt responses."
Dr. Singer says the effects of climate change would be, on the whole, positive. I counter that scientists lack the ability to predict definitively how global warming will affect regional climates and extreme weather events, or what major climate surprises might be in store. So it surprises me that any economic analysis, which must make assumptions on all of these, is possible at all.
The embattled global insurance industry, however, is less reticent than we scientists to make the global warming/extreme weather connection. Until 1988, a loss of more than $1-billion (US) on a single natural disaster was unheard of. Yet between 1988 and 1996, 15 such events occurred. Deducing that climate change is responsible for the 50-fold increase in economic losses to natural disasters during the past 30 years, the global insurance industry has pressed for greenhouse gas reductions.
Unfortunately, as we move toward ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, more and more skeptics will put public pressure on government because of its implications for industries dependent on fossil fuels. I suspect the anti-global warming campaign will employ the tactics of a legal defence team that knows it has lost its case. Numerous questions of doubt, whether they are well-founded or not, will be aimed at the public jury, with the desperate hope that one will produce a not-guilty verdict on society's influence on climate.
I fear corporate lobbying has already created an era of misinformation, and am extremely concerned about the disproportionate coverage the mainstream media gives to what is, in reality, negligible scientific controversy. Scientists are debating climate change in peer-reviewed, international journals. Yet this debate is not about if human-caused climate change is happening -- but rather how quickly, to what magnitude, with what regional implications and with what threats to humanity.

Abstract: Many of Dr. [Andrew Weaver]'s arguments are easily disposed of. If 1998 was the warmest year and 1999 is cooler, does that mean that the globe is cooling? One year does not make a trend. We all agree that there was substantial warming between 1900 and 1940. This warming marked the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA), which began around 1000 AD. But let's be honest. We had no global temperature measurements until weather satellites started regular observations in 1979. The reconstructions published by Michael Mann are based on proxy data such as the width of tree rings, and fail to even document the LIA; other researchers get quite different results. For example, Dorthe Dahl-Jensen and her colleagues, who used data from thermometers in bore holes of Greenland ice cores, clearly showed the LIA and the warming before 1940 (Science, Oct. 9, 1998). The authors remark explicitly that temperatures fell between 1940 and 1995. as I pointed out in my article, when we analyze sea-level data on a time scale of decades rather than millennia, we find that this long-term rise decreases markedly during a warming period (for example, between 1900 and 1940). The warming causes more evaporation from oceans, hence more global rainfall, and therefore more (short- term) ice accumulation on the Antarctic continent. Apparently, this transfer of water from the ocean to continental ice outweighs the effects of the melting mountain glaciers that raise sea levels. So it is all a matter of time scale. Any man-made (or natural) warming over the next century will slow down the inexorable rise of sea levels.

Full text: S. Fred Singer, PhD, is an atmospheric physicist, professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia, and president of the Fairfax-based Science & Environmental Policy Project, a non-profit policy institute.
As a lead author of the 1995 UN-IPCC climate report, Andrew Weaver understandably downplays its scientific uncertainties. Many of his IPCC colleagues are not so sanguine. The prestigious journal Science (May 16, 1997) interviewed IPCC participants and got rather skeptical reactions to the IPCC's conclusions. It's therefore disingenuous of Dr. Weaver to accuse scientific skeptics of pursuing an industry agenda while considering government bureaucracies to be free of hidden motives. For the record, my organization, the Science and Environmental Policy Project, is supported entirely by private donations and non-profit foundations.
This is not the place to enter into a detailed scientific debate. My arguments are spelled out in my recent book, Hot Talk, Cold Science: Global Warming's Unfinished Debate and on our Web site.
However, many of Dr. Weaver's arguments are easily disposed of. If 1998 was the warmest year and 1999 is cooler, does that mean that the globe is cooling? One year does not make a trend. We all agree that there was substantial warming between 1900 and 1940. This warming marked the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA), which began around 1000 AD. But let's be honest. We had no global temperature measurements until weather satellites started regular observations in 1979. The reconstructions published by Michael Mann are based on proxy data such as the width of tree rings, and fail to even document the LIA; other researchers get quite different results. For example, Dorthe Dahl-Jensen and her colleagues, who used data from thermometers in bore holes of Greenland ice cores, clearly showed the LIA and the warming before 1940 (Science, Oct. 9, 1998). The authors remark explicitly that temperatures fell between 1940 and 1995.
Dr. Weaver is not quite up-to-date on the analysis of satellite data. Even after corrections, they still show no sustained warming trend in the past 20 years. Quite independently, balloon-borne radiosondes give similar results. Climate modellers are trying to fit their computer results to the data by introducing questionable corrections (or forcings) from various aerosols, stratospheric ozone, and so on. I consider these efforts to be little more than curve-fitting exercises. As global warming guru James Hansen of NASA, who wrote last year in the Proceedings of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences: "The forcings that drive long-term climate change are not known with an accuracy sufficient to define future climate change."
I can clarify the sea-level issue that is puzzling Dr. Weaver. He is correct in stating that sea levels were 120 metres lower some 20,000 years ago and have been rising steadily since then, the peak of the last ice age. Sea levels will continue to rise as more of the remaining polar ice melts, especially in the Antarctic ice sheets. If our present warm interglacial period continues for a few more millennia, sea levels may rise another 10 metres, and we can do nothing about it.
But, as I pointed out in my article, when we analyze sea-level data on a time scale of decades rather than millennia, we find that this long-term rise decreases markedly during a warming period (for example, between 1900 and 1940). The warming causes more evaporation from oceans, hence more global rainfall, and therefore more (short- term) ice accumulation on the Antarctic continent. Apparently, this transfer of water from the ocean to continental ice outweighs the effects of the melting mountain glaciers that raise sea levels. So it is all a matter of time scale. Any man-made (or natural) warming over the next century will slow down the inexorable rise of sea levels.
As an aside, I find it strange that Dr. Weaver, who is so skeptical about the profit-seeking fossil-fuel industry, is so open to the arguments of the profit-seeking insurance industry. Could the reason be that they support his global warming fears? We should recognize their climate change arguments as self-serving, as they try to squeeze higher rates out of government regulators. In fact, hurricanes have been diminishing in frequency and intensity over the past 50 years, according to the UN-IPCC report. Population growth and increased investment, not global warming, have caused higher insurance losses.
To sum up, the crucial question is whether climate models can reproduce observations. So far at least, they have not only failed to do so, but their predictions differ from each other by several hundred percent.
Until climate models are reasonably well validated, we cannot accept their predictions, nor base far-reaching and costly policies on them. Under the circumstances, we should follow economically sound, "no-regrets" policies, such as cost-effective investments in energy conservation.

Whatever the bank holiday weather, the outlook for BBC2 is settled: a whole theme evening under this umbrella title, devoted to our national obsession for matters meteorological, and with the new weekly series, the Essential Guide to the Weather, at its centre. Surrounding areas are mostly on the dry side: a trio of doomy documentaries about climate change, global warming, and so forth, plus a couple of vaguely relevant movies and a late-night debate. {QQ}
Wild Thing{QQ}
8.05pm, C4{QQ}
A welcome antidote to those awful anthropomorphic ads, this compelling wildlife film about chimpanzees restores to the gods of the forest their savage natural beauty and dignity, and with the skilful use of camerawork and editing, gives us a chimps-eye view of their forest world. Its a red-in-tooth-and-claw society, uncompromisingly depicted, and the darker side of chimp life a monkey hunt, with the unfortunate prey being torn to pieces, the violent and promiscuous mating rituals may be a touch traumatic for young animal-lovers. {QQ}
The World Of Changing Rooms{QQ}
8.30pm, BBC1{QQ}
Hard to imagine Changing Rooms without the smiley Carol and the lovely Lawrence, but it appears that the makeover-swap format has been emulated the world over. This lead-in to next weeks new series introduces us to other nations designers and decorators including Australias very camp Kelvin, who makes our team seem positively conservative. {QQ}
The Mystery Of Men {QQ}
9.0pm, BBC`1{QQ}
The only mystery here is why an expensive film with an intriguing premise and an attractive cast should emerge as a tiresome and rather grubby pantomime-cum-sex farce. Warren Clarke, Robert Daws, Neil Pearson and Nick Berry play fortysomething drinking companions who take out an insurance policy together, so that one death benefits the rest: cue heavyhanded business about dicky tickers, saucy schoolgirls, death by sex and such. {QQ}

So there's an inevitable tendency to sit back in the hammock and take one more leisurely swing before summer's end. But let's assume, for the moment, that the worriers are right. Let's assume a relationship between the measurable increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the measurable warming of our planet by about one degree Fahrenheit over the past century.

Full text: AS WE NEAR the end of this scorching summer, a reasonable person can't help wondering whether the drought and shimmering heat we've experienced are a preview of what's ahead if global warming continues.
The problem is that a reasonable person can't be certain about global warming. The scientific data are still tentative; meanwhile, a powerful political lobby denies any real problem. So there's an inevitable tendency to sit back in the hammock and take one more leisurely swing before summer's end.
But let's assume, for the moment, that the worriers are right. Let's assume a relationship between the measurable increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the measurable warming of our planet by about one degree Fahrenheit over the past century.
And let's assume that the link between the two, while hard to prove now, will turn out as strong as the link between cigarette smoking and poor health.
The global-warming debate bears an eerie resemblance to the smoking debate several decades ago. Smokers might have been wheezing and coughing, but tobacco companies still ran ads featuring respectable-looking doctors assuring the public that cigarettes didn't do any real harm.
A current version of this upbeat science is the argument by one pro-industry group, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, that more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may actually benefit plants. Plants need the stuff to survive, after all, and the institute's newsletter contends, "Trees do better with more CO2."
I hope they're right.
BUT SUPPOSE the doomsayers are right. Imagine what the world might look like 50 years from now if global warming continues. That's precisely the task undertaken by the government's U.S. Global Change Research Program, in its national assessment of global climate change. I recently reviewed an early draft of the report, "Preparing for a Changing Climate."
If you're looking for a scary Labor Day beach book, this is it. It's still a draft, so the conclusions aren't final. But here are some likely changes as the world gets hotter and variations in global climate become more extreme:
{BUL} In the Northeast, warmer summertime temperatures and moister air likely will raise the heat index, making city life less comfortable. Development along the Atlantic coast may be threatened by more hurricanes and rising sea levels. In the Appalachians, warmer and moister air may lead to more intense rains and flash floods.
{BUL} In the Southeast, forests and agriculture may be affected by rising temperatures. Along the Gulf Coast, inundation of coastal wetlands may increase.
{BUL} In the West and Southwest, warmer winter temperatures may change the pattern of snowmelt, causing more runoff in winter and less in summer _ increasing, in turn, the threat of winter mudslides and summer fires and water shortages.
These are educated guesses, based on the best computer modeling that's available but by no means established fact. And that will give wiggle room to all the skeptics and naysayers when the final report is published in January.
BUT SUPPOSE the assessment is right. What will people say, looking back at 1999? Whom will they blame? And who will pay the cost?
If predictions prove accurate, the companies that have worked so hard to deny them may have a problem. Indeed, they may even have legal liability. And in a world where rising seas are inundating Miami and mudslides are devastating Los Angeles, the potential liability could total trillions of dollars.
Lynn Coleman, a former deputy secretary of energy who does legal work for some of the big oil companies, warns that the industry shouldn't ignore the risk of this sort of litigation. Energy may not be very different from tobacco or guns, he says.
If it can be shown that energy companies were selling products despite evidence that they might cause harm, Coleman notes, there may be a cause of action for what lawyers call a "tort." By one estimate, the insurance industry has begun creating a $200 billion reserve to pay the costs of damage caused by hurricanes and other extreme weather events. Someone is going to pay that bill.
Global warming, in this sense, may be a plaintiff lawyer's dream. And it's interesting, in a perverse way, to imagine how a jury in 2050 might react to some of the recent industry-backed studies minimizing the dangers of global warming. I suspect future jurors will not be amused. David Ignatius is an associate editor of The Washington Post, where this piece appeared.

Full text:   The leader of the West Midland business community has launched a scathing attack on the Government's controversial energy tax.
Regional CBI chairman Mr Digby Jones says Labour must negotiate with companies to set achievable levels of power use, rather than simply impose the so-called climate change levy without discretion.
He believes the impact of the tax will be "punitive" on many of the small companies that make up the bulk of this region's employers and jobs could be lost
"The Government has got it wrong with these proposals and needs to think again," he said.
Mr Jones's comments follow a similar recent broadside from the leader of the West Midland group of Labour MPs.
Mr Peter Snape (West Bromwich E) demanded that chancellor Mr Gordon Brown rethink the proposed tax on business use of gas, coal and electricity.
He predicted that it could be Labour's poll tax and warned that unless the Government backed down, he and other Midland Labour MPs might not support legislation putting it into practice.
Mr Snape also ridiculed Mr Brown's claim that national insurance rebates meant the tax would be "revenue neutral" by not raising cash for the Treasury.
"A revenue neutral tax is a creature I have never come across. It is a one-legged fish, a Loch Ness monster, a mythical figure," he told the Commons.
Mr Jones said the CBI recognised that global warming was a serious issue for all.
"Everybody needs to become more energy-efficient. Even small things like remembering to turn off lights and improving our home insulation can make a real difference," he added.
Mr Jones said the business community accepted that industry must play its part in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, stressing that firms across the region were already working to meet the targets set at the Kyoto Convention on climate change in 1997.
"However, we need to find the most cost-effective way to do so. The CBI supports an agenda of negotiated agreements, where one company cutting their emissions to below their own target can 'sell on' the extra to firms struggling to meet theirs," headded.
Mr Jones said there should also be more help, to small firms in particular, to encourage energy efficiency.
He shares Mr Snape's view that a revenue-neutral tax is mythical.
"For intensive users of energy, both large and small, this is not good news. The tax could be so large in relation to their expected reduction in national insurance that it will reduce the amount of money firms have to improve their energy efficiency andbe counter- productive," said Mr Jones.
He also fears that hard-pressed local manufacturers may be crippled by the tax.
"They are already hit by slow growth and the negative effect of sterling on their exports. They do not need another burden placed upon them."
"At worst it could be a sledgehammer, perhaps even forcing firms out of business or to move abroad to where climate taxes do not penalise industry unfairly."

Plants need the stuff to survive, after all, and the institute's newsletter, "Cooler Heads," contends: "Trees do better with more CO 2 ."
I hope they're right. Just as 20 years ago, puffing away happily on yet another Marlboro, I hoped the hacking cough I seemed to have each morning was just a persistent cold.
As with tobacco, there are powerful economic interests that would be harmed if we ever decided to take global warming seriously. For generations, members of Congress invoked all those poor tobacco farmers to explain why they wouldn't take tough action against smoking. But when it comes to global warming, we're all tobacco farmers. We've built an entire economy that lives off carbon-dioxide emissions. There are the oil companies that produce the hydrocarbons, and the car companies and electrical utilities that burn them.
So it's no surprise that Congress is siding with industry in opposing any action to reduce global warming, just as it sided for so many years with the tobacco companies.
But suppose the doomsayers are right. Imagine what the world might look like 50 years from now if global warming continues. That's precisely the task that has been undertaken by the government's U.S. Global Change Research Program, in its "national assessment" of global climate change.

But let's suppose that the assessment is right and we've got a hotter, wetter world -- with more of the extreme weather we've seen the past few years. What will people say, looking back at 1999? Whom will they blame? And to take the kind of practical problem lawyers enjoy, who will pay the cost?
Here again, the best analogy may be tobacco. If global warming predictions prove accurate, the companies that have been working so hard to deny them may have a problem. Indeed, they may even have legal liability. And in a world where rising seas are inundating Miami and mudslides are devastating Los Angeles, the potential liability could total trillions of dollars.

Bless me, car denial is no sin: [1 Edition]

Abstract: Ten days ago I celebrated a full month without smoking. To mark the occasion of these weeks without the weed, I determined to buy myself a present. I calculated the funds saved by not buying three packs of Lambert & Butler a day. The total was a sum so vast I shall not mention it here, for fear of disbelief. I made for Stornoway and, after some hunting around, bought the best bicycle in town. I used to be a very keen cyclist. Summer holidays, in childhood, were spent biking about Lewis. When I was 19, in a mighty rites-of- passage tour, I cycled, over five days, from Edinburgh by Skye to Stornoway. Untold evenings passed in contented tinkering with derailleur gears, rear-cassettes, stem adjustment. I had no interest whatever in cars. When I started journalism I came, naturally, under heavy pressure to start driving. I was 26, however, before I passed the test - at my fourth attempt - and then only bought as little car as I could get away with, a Ford Fiesta. It is a curious part of the stop-smoking psychology that, once the habit is cracked and the elation builds, you start savagely to question every aspect of your life. For years, you realise, you have been puffing away at considerable expense in a complete, beautifully marketed con. In what other respects have you been brainwashed? I had not had my new bike 24 hours when my eye fell cynically on my car. I thought of local petrol, 91p a litre; the road tax due by the end of August; the insurance premiums; a looming MOT. Many a day I was not driving at all, and still this behemoth sat on my land, draining away resources in assorted direct-debits.

I do not like cars. I cannot understand them, fix them, or service them. I am not the world's best driver, either; too prone to look at the hills rather than the road. Still, everyone assured me of the absolute necessity of owning and running a car. So I obediently went along with them. Anyway, heavy smoking and cycling do not mix. Pedalling up the Clisham loses much of its charm when your lungs are whining like a mistuned banjo.
Now, once again, we have a bicycle. It is a Giant 500X, a hybrid model, crossing a traditional cycle frame, and big wheels, with modern mountain-bike technology. The result is a very safe, easily operated, and rather fast road bike. The 21 gears laugh going up Harris hills and the high stem and handlebars make it most safe to hurtle down them. I wear a helmet, of course. It looks stupid, but not as stupid as I would look with a cracked skull. My new friend's only drawback is its weight; the lighter a bike, the better it is. But it is blissful fun to ride and is fast proving an efficient mode of transport.
It is a curious part of the stop-smoking psychology that, once the habit is cracked and the elation builds, you start savagely to question every aspect of your life. For years, you realise, you have been puffing away at considerable expense in a complete, beautifully marketed con. In what other respects have you been brainwashed? I had not had my new bike 24 hours when my eye fell cynically on my car. I thought of local petrol, 91p a litre; the road tax due by the end of August; the insurance premiums; a looming MOT. Many a day I was not driving at all, and still this behemoth sat on my land, draining away resources in assorted direct-debits.
"Macleod," I said firmly, "you don't need a car." No-one has convinced me otherwise. I am within ready cycling distance of my favourite places in North Harris. There is a fine local bus service. For high days and holidays a car can readily be hired. So, since Saturday, I am a carless zone. For a year or two Macleod shall not motor.
All choices are overdetermined. I started smoking in my late teens, because it was virtually the only space for rebellion I had; in those days my choices were imposed by others. Kicking the fags, a large part of me has regressed to that frustrated, angry teenager, questioning the thoughtless, complacent assumptions of family, church, and society. Then there are economics: my finances presently resemble those of a banana republic, without the bananas, and dispensing with a car effects considerable savings.
But there is also a moral issue. In Harris, with its scattered townships and scanty amenities, one can make out a credible case for car ownership - just. For the mass of society, running a car is a choice increasingly indefensible. In the past three years, globally, 25 million people have been displaced by climate change: advancing desert, catastrophic floods, dying forests, and failed harvests. An Oxford academic has remarked - with much truth - that, today, a car is more dangerous than a gun. Vast resources are consumed in the manufacture of cars. The mass of atmospheric pollution is created by cars. Cities are noisy, dangerous, jamming, stinking, choking horrors because of the car.
Nothing about the car makes sense. Few buy a car by pure, cold- headed selection: what is the most efficient machine to carry me from A to B? We buy a car not as a means of transport, but as a statement. The vehicle becomes personal territory. Its size, colour, contours, speed, and road-handling speak volumes about ourselves, our values, our sexuality, our dreams and dreads and aspirations.
We are so convinced by societal norms that we must run a car that we are prepared to put up with great imposition and inconvenience. The motorist is ruthlessly and at every turn taxed: only a fraction of the yield is invested in the roads network. Most of us, if we ever fall foul of the law, trip over a myriad motoring offences. A car is bureaucracy, paperwork, compulsory insurance, and perpetual worry. Owning a car is also a serious compromise of your privacy. You are noted, recorded, logged, and spied on at every opportunity.
There are few parts of Britain where one can truly enjoy motoring. Yet, in all our cities, we daily see the absurdity of the car culture. A bus holding perhaps 100 people is caught in a lengthy traffic-jam; most of the traffic is private cars, each containing one person.
We drive everywhere. We drive to the factory and we drive to the office and we drive the wee ones to school. We grow fat and flabby from lack of exercise, and - if that matters to us - then hasten to pay heavy fees to join gyms and health-clubs. Every year there seem to be more and more cars. In Stornoway, of all places, there is a chronic parking problem. In Tarbert itself, especially in summer, traffic crawls and jams along the narrow Main Street. In my parents' street in Edinburgh every household seems to run two cars. Some seem to have three.
Well, count me out. I'm biking. I can bike to Scalpay and Luskentyre and Scadabay. Stornoway is readily accessible on the bus. Wildon, or McNally, hire out cars on reasonable terms if I feel like a rare hurl to the Butt. And there is the sheer, euphoric feel of cycling. I don my helmet and shades and shoot off down Scott Road in a cool, sorted world of my own. I spend ages birling in circles, figures-of-eight around the pier car park. It gives me a feeling of immense satisfaction. It is something I do for myself, not something that is done to me; I feel already fitter, and sleep far better. Besides - as the wise man said - there is no point being grown up if you can't be childish.

Full text: When a monstrous thunderstorm ripped through Windsor last month - -killing one man and knocking out power to 15,000 homes -- the Weather Network, the all-weather cable channel, ran a sunny repeat segment about cranberries on the East Coast.
The segment concluded with the poignant message: "When there's not enough rain, Ned turns on his watering system."
Despite the severity of the Windsor storm, the station that promises to cover "weather and environmental issues 24 hours a day" did not provide any footage of the storm -- which, for the instantaneous visual medium of TV, is like publishing a newspaper without headlines.
About six million Canadians watch The Weather Network, but critics of the profitable channel say it is increasingly clogged with commercials and sometimes fails to show footage of the most dramatic stories. The Network airs a mix national forecasts and weather stories, with cutaways to local forecasts every ten minutes or so.
"I always find the stuff between the local forecasts weak and unnecessary," says Vince Carlin, chair of the School of Journalism at Ryerson Polytechnic University, and the former head of CBC Newsworld. "They try to dress it up as a whole story ... just to get people to the next commercial."
Recently, the network also reported a warning of "unconfirmed reports of tornado sightings" in Southern Ontario, but did not confirm them.
Another serious environmental story was going up in flames in a Newfoundland forest fire recently. The Weather Network's Chris St. Clair included the story on a newcast, but again there were no visuals. Local residents and firefighters were the only ones to witness the severity of the fire.
St. Clair went on to warn of impending thundershowers, which showed up as promised later that day, just as Environment Canada also forecast. Then the newscast rolled on to a story about berry lovers in Vancouver facing "the problem" of raspberries and strawberries ripening at the same time because of a cool, wet summer. The thunder storm footage, or any storm footage from anywhere across Canada, never materialized on the national weather channel.
"Sometimes I wonder just who would watch it on a continual basis," says media critic Barry Zwicker. "If they seldom show footage, it is a fundamental shortcoming. It's of paramount importance."
Important to about six million people across Canada who tune in, however briefly, to the Weather Network every week to receive everything from pollen forecasts and road conditions to temperatures from around the globe.
The network began in the late 1980s to simply "give Canadians the weather." It evolved into somewhat of a champion for the environment, becoming one of the only broadcasters in the country to run a controversial commercial to save the old-growth rainforests of B.C.'s Clayoquot Sound.
Today it has become laden with advertising and newscasts that tell, but don't always show, how bad things are on the ground. For anyone wanting immediate information about a storm hammering the neighbourhood, a drive around the block might be more enlightening.
"There's a fine line between someone trying to sell you something and someone trying to give you information," says media analyst John Corcelli, who frequently watches the channel. "This is the problem in contemporary media -- we don't even know (the difference) anymore."
The Weather Network is broadcast 24 hours a day by Pelmorex Communications Inc., a private, multimedia company based in Mississauga. The company also runs Pelmorex Radio, the licensee of several English and French AM and FM radio stations across northern Ontario.
Pelmorex is indirectly controlled by Pierre Morrisette, and 50- per-cent owned by U.S.-based Landmark Communications, which broadcasts the Weather Channel in the United States.
Pelmorex, in addition, owns the French-language weather channel, MeteoMedia, bought in 1993 from Lavalin Communications for $32 million, and uses a single licence to broadcast in both official languages. Combined, the two networks reach an average eight million people through 750 affiliated cable companies every week.
Also reaching the Weather Network's audience, however, is a sharp increase in advertising. According to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, national advertising revenues for Pelmorex jumped from $1.2 million in 1994 to more than $5 million in 1998.
Between 1995 and 1996 alone, ad revenues jumped almost 70 per cent. During that time, the company spent no money on "program investment," according to the CRTC. Pelmorex Communications made a pre-tax profit of $2.4 million on total revenues of almost $28.4 million in 1998.
In the U.S., media awareness groups have now begun to label weather channels "TV clutter" based on the ratio of information to advertising. And in Britain last spring, the Weather Channel closed its operations after posting "low audience viewership." Offices in the Netherlands and Italy were also closed.
The Weather Network is excellent for showing temperatures across the country, even posting the highs for Iqaluit. The forecasters get excited when a storm watch or storm warning is issued, and the network never fails to show looming high and low pressure systems. There is enough weather data to keep the most ardent armchair meteorologist involved, and the show boasts an 75- to 80-per-cent accuracy rate on its two- and three-day predictions.
Jim Davis, manager of marketing and research for Pelmorex, says when severe weather hits, as it has been with increasing regularity in this country, more people tune in to the Weather Network to see what's going on.
He cites the huge snowstorm to hit Toronto last winter. The storm prompted the mayor to call in the army and viewership almost doubled, says Davis.
He says the company doesn't have the resources to station a reporter and producer in every major urban centre to supply videotape for the national broadcasts.
The network has bureaus in Moncton, Halifax, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver.
"We don't have electronic news gathering teams in every market," says Mr. Davis. "That would be really cost prohibitive, and the only folks who can do that are our friends at the CBC."
When a sudden storm hits a specific region, the Weather Network must often rely on feeds borrowed from local stations and other networks, says Davis, though news staff are dispatched when the weather is severe enough. "If it's something really major, you'll find, if you check the records, we do have a lot of footage."
For the local forecasts, he says it would be impossible for the network to broadcast live images because the technology hasn't been developed to send different images to almost 1,000 cable outlets simultaneously.
The information the network receives comes from several sources, he adds. The company depends heavily on Environment Canada for raw data, then uses its staff of about 30 meterologists, as well as computers with mathematical forecasting programs, to produce its own weather predictions.
As for not covering the Windsor storm, he says, "it's an editorial call."
"Is the footage compelling enough that the people are really going to want to see it?
"A lot of the times the aftermath is a picture of a roof blown off a building. Is that really good TV?"
Some would say it is. Richard Pollay, a professor of marketing and commerce at the University of British Columbia, says it is vital for any television weather forecaster to provide up-to-the-second visual material,either with eye-in-the-sky cameras or live reports.
He also says the Weather Network is risking its credibility when it runs commercials for Claritin, an allergy medication, on its pollen report. "It certainly is suspicious," says Mr. Pollay.
"It's clear they might overemphasize to keep their advertisers happy."
But Davis insists ad revenues have nothing to do with the editorial content of the show and the two departments keep an arm's- length relationship.
"Our worst fear, when you talk advertising sales, is that you have to run a story that's critical of the advertiser and they happen to be buying ad time," explains Davis. "But at the same time, anyone who has journalistic integrity would say, `Well, we've got to run the story.' What we do in an ad-sales perspective has no bearing on what stories we choose to cover."
What seldom gets covered, says Zwicker, are the links between extreme weather and global warming, caused by greenhouses gases. He says the Weather Network is in a excellent position to make the connection, though he says almost all major media outlets refuse to accept the notion.
"All media I know of refuse to connect the dots between extreme weather events and global warming," says Zwicker. "The public is further ahead on this cause-and-effect relationship."
Indeed, the weather is getting weird, says Henry Hengeveld, science adviser on climate issues for Environment Canada, but he does not blame the changes entirely on global warming.
"Certainly in terms of our records we're seeing certain things we've never seen before," he says. "But whether native populations saw them 200 years ago, we don't know."
Hengeveld says the insurance industry is convinced the weather has turned for the worse, and it has experienced a steep increases in claims.
He says another explanation for the strange weather events is the lack of accurate records, which only date back about 30 years. This creates a potentially massive problem, since society has built its infrastructure on weather models that go back only three decades.
"The kind of things we are seeing, even if we can't attribute it to climate change yet, is what we expect to happen more often in climate change," says Hengeveld. "In a sense (this weird weather) is a harbinger, or dry run, to the things we expect to see in the future."
That gives the Weather Network a crucial role on the landscape of Canadian weather forecasting. Its coverage becomes essential to millions.
"Certainly the huge and costly weather disasters of recent years - - the Saguenay and Red River floods and the 1998 ice storm, in particular -- are warning signs that not only are we not immune to such disasters, but also we're not as well equipped to to deal with them as we'd like to think," writes Lydia Dotto in her book, Storm Warning.
"A great deal more research must be done to enhance our prediction and warning skills and the technological and social mechanisms that will help us cope as the climate warms during the next century," she says.

Full text: Headline in early edition: "Sharing the stage with the ubiquitous Lees"
Meg Lees is quietly making a pitch for the hearts and minds of corporate Australia and her chief weapon is a three-legged stool.
Each leg, says Lees, represents a plank of the Democrats approach to policy development. Legislation must meet the triple test of delivering economic, social and environmental benefits.
According to Lees, each leg must be given equal strength, otherwise it will topple.
The Democrats were successful in making the GST-based tax package "greener", and inserted a clause about the environment into the proposed constitutional preamble.
Lees says the Democrats are not anti-business, and has been seeking corporate leaders and industry groups to present her economic credentials.
She also wants to improve corporate Australia's sense of social and environmental policy, which remains the Democrats' core business.
But since last year's election, there has been more interest from the top end of town in getting to know (and influence) the Democrats. The party's nine senators hold the balance of power in the Upper House and can veto Government legislation unless it is supported by Labor.
It means Lees is flavor of the month in the nation's boardrooms and she is using the access to recast her party, which was for years has been portrayed as the fairies at the bottom of the garden. A big step forward was the GST negotiations, when the Democrats traded blows with John Howard and Peter Costello.
In relation to business tax, Lees is promising nothing, but doing a lot of listening. She has observed that most business chiefs do not understand the Senate committee process and focus their energies on trying to directly lobby the Government.
Part of her message has been to explain that, in her view, the Senate is the real powerhouse, and offers business an alternative forum to present their views.
"It is the Senate, with its committee processes, its serious - but unpredictable - legislative debates, and its frequently used powers to amend legislation that exercises the real powers of the legislature," she says.
Lees says the Democrats are Australia's "only specialist Senate party", and increasingly seen by voters as "third-party insurance".
In fact, she dismisses the House of Representatives as little more than a forum to elect the Prime Minister. "After that, rigid party discipline reduces the House to a mere echo chamber of the Prime Minister and his Government," she says.
The Democrats have held seminars with members of the Investment and Financial Services Association and the Australian Bankers Association, and Lees recently had a boardroom lunch with 10 senior partners and clients of one big accounting firm.
Last week she took her message to the Insurance Council of Australia and put forward a financial reason why insurers should back tougher environment policies.
Lees said the CSIRO estimated climate change would increase temperatures in Australia by between 0.3 and 1.4 per cent by 2030, and winter rainfall would decline by 20per cent by 2070.
She said extreme weather such as drought, floods, hailstorms and hurricances would occur more often, and public health costs would increase due to a wider spread of tropical and respiratory diseases.
"This spells bad news for the insurance industry," she told them. "Longer-running insurance contracts will inevitably be affected by the growing costs of global warming. Greenhouse, increasingly, is an economic issue."
Lees is to step up her links with business as her ever-expanding diary tests its limits.
She will speak to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia in Perth on 3 September, in which her party's views on business tax will be outlined. She will also deliver the keynote speech at the IFSA conference on 21 September.
Increasingly she is taking the stage where once only Government ministers stood.

Abstract: The Government's proposed energy tax could mean up to 6,000 jobs being lost across the UK castings industry. Opposition to the proposal has also come from Oldbury chemical company BIP whose chairman and chief executive Dr Keith Sansom has made a "strongly worded" complaint to MP Mr John Spellar (Lab Warley). Dr Sansom said the company was a major employer in Oldbury and a new management team had successfully turned round the business during the last three years.

Full text: The Government's proposed energy tax could mean up to 6,000 jobs being lost across the UK castings industry.
The warning was given yesterday by the industry which fears that customers will be forced into buying castings from abroad.
Opposition to the proposal has also come from Oldbury chemical company BIP whose chairman and chief executive Dr Keith Sansom has made a "strongly worded" complaint to MP Mr John Spellar (Lab Warley).
Dr Sansom said the company was a major employer in Oldbury and a new management team had successfully turned round the business during the last three years.
Mr Sansom said: "As the levy stands at present it will seriously harm BIP.
"It is calculated that the annual cost to the company of the levy, created ostensibly to promote efficiency and thereby reduce industry's carbon dioxide emissions, will be pounds 225,000.
"With a mere pounds 25,000 annually from any concession on National Insurance contributions - 11.7 per cent to 12.2 per cent - the net cost at BIP will be ten jobs.
"Export manufacturers are under severe pressure from the strength of the pound and now we face a further burden."
In his Budget statement in March, Chancellor Gordon Brown said a climate change levy - described since as a form of energy tax - would be imposed from April, 2001.
He told the Commons it would be "a revenue neutral tax".
Mr John Aldous, of Castings 2000+, an organisation set up to improve the UK competitiveness, said competitors already had lower employment costs.
If the levy was introduced up to 6,000 jobs could go in the industry.
"The significant level of investment needed to meet European environmental legislation are all combining to make it very difficult for companies to stay in business.
"We have recently seen a number of foundries close," he said.
MP Mr Peter Snape (Lab West Bromwich E) has called on the Chancellor to rethink the proposal and warned it could be Labour's poll tax.
He cited the case of Sandwell Castings which would have to pay pounds 72,742 in the new tax, but would get a rebate of only pounds 17,019 through the 0.5 per cent cut in national insurance.
Castings 2000+ broadly supports the recently published views of the Trade and Industry select committee which has strongly urged the Government to carefully reconsider the design of the levy "to avoid inflicting serious damage on UK manufacturing".
Mr Brown felt first-hand the anger the proposed tax has aroused during a flying visit to the West Midlands 24 hours before the recent Euro-elections.
The Chancellor met members of the West Midlands CBI and, after outlining Labour's economic policies, asked for questions from his audience.
Mr Brown was berated about the tax by several members and was clearly unhappy about his reception.
His only response was to claim repeatedly that the proposal was "revenue neutral", which brought jeers from his audience.

Science: Sunshine superman Tim Radford on the scientist who hauled big business over the coals then took up the power game

Author: Radford, Tim

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/science-sunshine-superman-tim-radford-on/docview/245424479/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Jeremy Leggett, earth scientist and campaigner, is an optimist. He sees a sunlit future. He sees sunlight crashing onto rooftiles which look quite like tiles but which are really just sheets of amorphous silicon backed by stainless steel: every one a photovoltaic cell. A photon of light - whether from direct sunlight or reflected off clouds - still packs a punch. It can slam into the amorphous silicon to be converted by the magic of modern physics directly into electric current where it flows into the wiring, keeps the freezer at -15C, chills the Chardonnay in the fridge, powers the domestic appliances and still leaves him spare current to sell to the electricity board and help the national grid. On average, the sunshine that hits the earth has enough energy every square metre to run an electric hairdryer. Capturing that energy is a problem. Plants use photosynthesis to tap about 4%. Dr Leggett reckons amorphous silicon tiles harvest as much as 8%. He has the equivalent of 1.4 kilowatts on his little roof in Richmond, Surrey. Even on a cloudy day, he argues, his roof provides the current for 350 cups of tea, 70 episodes of Coronation Street and 800 slices of toast.

Full text: Jeremy Leggett, earth scientist and campaigner, is an optimist. He sees a sunlit future. He sees sunlight crashing onto rooftiles which look quite like tiles but which are really just sheets of amorphous silicon backed by stainless steel: every one a photovoltaic cell.
A photon of light - whether from direct sunlight or reflected off clouds - still packs a punch. It can slam into the amorphous silicon to be converted by the magic of modern physics directly into electric current where it flows into the wiring, keeps the freezer at -15C, chills the Chardonnay in the fridge, powers the domestic appliances and still leaves him spare current to sell to the electricity board and help the national grid.
On average, the sunshine that hits the earth has enough energy every square metre to run an electric hairdryer. Capturing that energy is a problem. Plants use photosynthesis to tap about 4%. Dr Leggett reckons amorphous silicon tiles harvest as much as 8%. He has the equivalent of 1.4 kilowatts on his little roof in Richmond, Surrey. Even on a cloudy day, he argues, his roof provides the current for 350 cups of tea, 70 episodes of Coronation Street and 800 slices of toast.
`With it, in the four months I have been connected to the grid I have generated 670 kilowatt hours of electricity,' he says. `I'm 68% ahead. I've exported 68% more than I have consumed in that period. It's very efficient at low light conditions. It gives the lie to the widely held view that we need sun to make it work and is only suitable for the South of France.'
He began as a researcher into the geological history of the oceans and acted as a petroleum geology consultant, walking in each day through the portals of the Royal School of Mines at Imperial College.
The Cold War was hotting up, so he joined Scientists Against Nuclear Arms. He began writing for the Guardian's science pages. As a seismologist, he watched Cold Warriors claiming that since there was no way of detecting breaches of a test ban, there was no point in a test ban treaty. So he set up Vertic, the verification technology information centre, a London-based group which detected and confirmed a Chinese test explosion in the Lop Nor desert and announced it even before Washington could, or Beijing would.
From there he become scientific director of Greenpeace International and spent a decade fighting the international battle over fossil fuel use and global warming. Then he became an entrepreneur and now heads a business called SolarCentury, on the principle that money talks: if you can produce reliable power at less cost and with almost no pollution and show people that it works then it's better than shouting yourself hoarse about the environment.
`We worked out that we can sell these systems at about pounds 10,000 per kilowatt - that's about 16.5 square metres - fully installed, with all the wiring, the electrics, the converters, connected to the grid, warranties in place. There are various ways of looking at that.
`Is that price going to come down in years ahead? Yes. The economies of scale in manufacturing are spectacular. The global market is showing signs of taking off. It grew at 40% in 1997, 32% in '98. In the first quarter of this year most companies' sales were up 40%. Warehouses were empty and the investors are getting interested. If you think about it, the prizes are very big.'
The vision - not just his - is of electricity made on the spot, courtesy of the sun, every day, with the surplus exported to industry. Why build fossil fuel power stations that will stoke up global warming and clouds of acid rain as well?
Why spend millions on nuclear power stations which run for 30 years but have to be guarded for another 120 years before they can be dismantled? The electricity supply business, he says, is well on the way to becoming a trillion dollar business. There are no known constraints on the supply of raw materials for his preferred form of solar power supply: anything could happen and fast.
When John Battle, energy minister, and Michael Meacher, environment secretary, were in opposition, he set up an industry solar task force at their request. BP were in on it, along with Eastern Electricity, the Natwest bank and Guardian Royal Exchange insurance company. Norman Foster, the architect, was in on it. The conclusions, he says, was that global warming was a threat to the British economy and that solar photovoltaic systems could be the `single most important long term means' of achieving the deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. These were remarkable conclusions for big companies to reach. The Germans have a government solar power initiative for 100,000 solar-tiled homes by 2005, and the Japanese are installing 10,000 photovoltaic roofs a year. The Americans will have one million solar roofs by 2010.
In Britain, there is a 100-roof field trial and that is all. Dr Leggett is still waiting for Messrs Battle and Meacher to do something about the recommendations.
`I can't begin to understand why they aren't being acted on. It's in danger of becoming a national embarrassment,' he says.
His new book, The Carbon Wars (Penguin) is an account of a bruising decade as an international campaigner, trying to persuade governments to take the atmosphere crisis seriously, in the teeth of a wrecking campaign by representatives of the fossil fuel industries. Most of the grim warnings uttered a decade ago still hold. Most of the hottest years ever recorded have occurred in the last 15 years, and 1998 was the hottest ever. It was also the most costly for climate related disasters. Governments have agreed on a convention on climate change, but it isn't obvious that politicians take the issue seriously.
Dr Leggett remains an optimist. He just decided to take the battle somewhere else. `I just figured why not have a crack at a huge prize, which is to create an investment vehicle, or even a series of investment vehicles?
`Rather than talking to these people in principle about what they might do with their money I could create something that becomes irresistible. Whether it works or not is obviously an interesting question for me - but I am completely convinced the solar revolution is coming, and it is going to create a vast new business revolution.'
The Carbon War: Despatches From The End Of The Oil Century, by Jeremy Leggett, will be published by Penguin at pounds 20 on August 26.

Global warming can be reduced by using trains: [Final Edition]

Abstract: With Waterloo Regional Transit should come interlocking schedules with intercity buses and trains and at least hourly buses between Kitchener-Waterloo and Guelph and between Guelph and Cambridge, followed by half-hour service. In Amtrak's northeast corridor, high-speed trains will whisk passengers between Boston and Washington at speeds up to 240 kilometres per hour this fall. Annual fuel consumption is to drop by 53 million litres with the switch to electric trains. Upgrading rail will avoid enormous environmental consequences of new highway construction, says Amtrak. U.S. federal and state governments combine to bring these projects into reality. ASSOCIATED PRESS; Tests are under way in Colorado for the high-speed train being developed for Amtrak by Quebec-based Bombardier. The trains will run from Boston to Washington this year at speeds of up to 240 kilometres an hour. Canada should be putting federal funds into modern trains, not more highways and cars, creating more pollution.; [George Bechtel]

Full text: Note
It's a good time to get refocused.
David Phillips, senior climatologist at Environment Canada, refers to Ontario's 20-month heat wave as unprecedented. "We've never seen that kind of a trend in this part of the world," he said in the July 21 Record article Warm Nights Contribute To 20 Month Heat Wave.
Lecturer and author Lydia Dotto, in her book Storm Warning, Gambling With The Climate Of Our Planet, states that in Toronto, the number of days above 30 degrees C each summer would be expected to increase from 10 to 53 if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels doubled.
Dotto says that global warming may cause catastrophic damages around the world. And if we wait for proof, it will be too late: Catastrophe will have happened.
Before the second Conference of Parties in Geneva in July 1996, 60 insurance companies, mostly European, signed a "statement of environmental commitment." The insurance companies argued that reducing greenhouse emissions would be "the most efficient precautionary measure" and that a treaty should "achieve early, substantial reductions."
The sooner we start cutting energy use, the more economically palatable those cuts can be. Act now and save should be easily understood, but delay and pay more is the path we've chosen.
We say we are dedicated to getting people out of their cars, but we are to build more roads first. Building more roads is the sure- fire way to encourage more driving. If all that can be done for the automobile is done, there will be a very low level of interest in, and use of, public transportation.
Rick Ducharme, chief general manager of the Toronto Transit Commission, says, "In Vancouver, transit comes first and if there's room afterwards, then there's cars."
It's a good time to get refocused because the Regional Municipality of Waterloo is to take over the Kitchener and Cambridge transit systems on Jan. 1, 2000. Putting transit ahead of cars will require transferring road money to transit.
No transit system in the world thrives with only local money. Ducharme, referring to the Toronto transit system, says that if we don't get the province and feds back to the table, we are not going to build the infrastructure needed to make transit strong.
With Waterloo Regional Transit should come interlocking schedules with intercity buses and trains and at least hourly buses between Kitchener-Waterloo and Guelph and between Guelph and Cambridge, followed by half-hour service.
It's a good time to get refocused because for the first time in North America, high-speed trains are being transformed from a "futuristic concept into reality."
In Amtrak's northeast corridor, high-speed trains will whisk passengers between Boston and Washington at speeds up to 240 kilometres per hour this fall. Annual fuel consumption is to drop by 53 million litres with the switch to electric trains. Upgrading rail will avoid enormous environmental consequences of new highway construction, says Amtrak. U.S. federal and state governments combine to bring these projects into reality.
Transportation writer Patricia Richardson reports that Illinois has earmarked $70 million US to upgrade a 177-kilometre section of track to 177 km/h on the Chicago-St. Louis line. The $70 million US will also cover the cost of new trains.
This is of utmost interest for our region because it gives us some idea of the cost of providing modern, fast train service on our line through Kitchener. In contrast to Illinois, Ontario pumps about $800 million yearly into highway construction and nothing into rail infrastructure in southern Ontario.
Modern trains and a magic carpet regional transit system should be provided even without a climate change threat. These are easy-to- do steps in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We combat climate change while improving our quality of life and using our financial resources to build the best possible transportation systems for the money spent.
Let's make a deal with the province and the feds because if we don't, we'll have to make a deal with our soil and our air. As Dotto suggests, soil and air swing a much tougher deal than governments.
George Bechtel of Kitchener is a former president of Transport 2000 Ontario.

Full text: Australia could afford to scrap or drastically reduce payroll tax by requiring polluters to pay for permits to emit greenhouse gases, a new report has revealed.
Issued by the Canberra think-tank, the Australia Institute, the report argues that a system of tradeable permit emissions could raise up to $7 billion annually in revenue. The institute estimates that about 160 refineries, gas plants and coal mines around the nation would need to sign up to the emission permit system.
The institute's executive director, Dr Clive Hamilton, said the virtue of the proposal was that it would do two things at once by helping the environment and giving a boost to jobs growth.
In particular, a system of emissions trading would help Australia meet the environmental standards on greenhouse emissions set by the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.
Payroll tax is a state tax levied on employer payrolls above a certain level. In 1996-97, nearly $8 billion was collected by the states and territories.
Many economists argue that the tax acts as a brake on employment growth by making it more expensive to expand staff levels. The idea behind businesses having to buy permits to pollute through an auction process is being examined by governments around the world as a means of controlling greenhouse-gas pollution. In the case of Australia, Dr Hamilton suggested that by charging $20 a tonne for emissions of CO2, up to $7 million could be raised.
If the charge was dropped to $15 a tonne, the revenue would be $5 billion.
A tradeable emissions system should be seen as an important and innovative tool of economic policy, the report said.
The final report of the Ralph review of business taxation has just been handed to the Howard Government.
Neglect of environmental considerations is a serious omission on the part of the Ralph committee, and in this regard it has failed to fully address the needs of the new Dr Hamilton said.
Two key issues that the Ralph review did consider, however, were the proposal to cut the company tax rate and to scrap the system of accelerated depreciation. The Australia Institute's report said there were environmental reasons to retain accelerated depreciation because it allowed for a higher turnover of capital equipment that could incorporate newer, less polluting technology.
The report also identified the sectors of the economy that would be most affected by a switch to a lower company tax rate and ending accelerated depreciation. These are finance, insurance, real estate, business services and retail trade.

Full text: At a time when changes in global weather patterns are blamed for everything from catastrophic hurricanes to droughts, it is easy to overlook a basic truth about natural hazards: human beings -- not just nature -- are the cause of mounting disaster losses.
This is certainly true in Florida, where the consequences of coastal development have contributed to the destruction caused by large hurricanes. For the near future, local decision-making on land- use management and construction practices will have far more impact on reducing disaster losses than global efforts to avert climate change.
Given our recent history, one of the recurring enigmas is how doomsday scenarios about extreme weather and rising sea levels from global warming can divert attention from the risks people face now.
The number of people residing in coastal counties subject to hurricanes is growing rapidly. Florida grew from 3 million people in 1950 to more than 13 million by the early 1990s.
More people mean greater exposure to extreme weather.
But population growth is only part of the story. Inequality in personal incomes also makes many people more vulnerable to hazards and less able to recover from them.
And development of all kinds -- homes and office buildings, communications, utilities and transportation systems, infrastructure in general -- is growing in density, making the potential losses from natural hazards larger.
One central problem is that the public increasingly looks to insurance to compensate for losses from many types of risk-taking behavior. And even when insurance is available, most property owners do not buy coverage against special perils, notably earthquakes and floods.
For example, nationwide only about 20 percent of the homes exposed to floods have flood insurance. Many people assume that federal disaster assistance will function as a kind of hazard insurance, but such aid is almost always limited.
No one really knows how large future disasters could be. A new study by the National Academy of Sciences says that a conservative estimate of total dollar losses from natural disasters during the past 20 years is $500 billion. It also says that only 17 percent of the losses were insured.
Clearly, there is a limited amount the federal government can do about it. Indeed, subsidies built into federal insurance and relief programs probably help account for the massive increase in development in hazard-prone areas. My own house is covered by flood insurance -- a requirement of the mortgage lending institution; without it we would not have built our home where it is!
There is a degree of personal responsibility we must assume, too. We need to educate ourselves regarding natural hazards, and to insist that homes are constructed properly according to known risks.
More efficient use of land and space is also essential. There must be greater emphasis on trees, parks, and open space. Mixed-use environments that are more amenable to walking and less dependent on automobiles are part of the solution. We have in fact traded cheap land for expensive transportation.
But there is another step we can take to reduce exposure to hazards, besides placing limits on the number of people living in hazard-prone areas. That is to strengthen local government by an inclusive process that gathers all interests.
Development in hazard-prone areas requires wise land-use management -- especially controls to protect natural environmental resources that mitigate damage, such as mangrove stands, wetlands, coastal vegetation, and sand dunes. The best way to do this work is to rely on -- and to hold accountable -- local government and its communities of interested citizens.
Florida's experience shows that everyone has a stake in seeking to forge local consensus on disaster resiliency.
We must advance the idea that each locality controls the character of its disasters, forcing people to take responsibility for natural hazards and to realize that the decisions they make today will determine future losses.

Abstract: IN 1912 Robert Paterson, a Banff and Buchan farmer, refused to pay the new National Insurance contributions of his employees. When he refused to pay the fine, one of his cows was poinded to settle it. At the auction at Turriff market, the animal escaped. Paterson had painted "LG & Coo Lendrum to Leeks" on the side of the animal as an insult to Lloyd George's Government. The turpentine used to remove the paint enraged the cow, which broke free and caused pandemonium in the town. Paterson and his associates were arrested and charged with rioting, but the case against them was found not proven. The cow was later sent to the Aberdeen market, where it was bought back by some farmers as a present for Paterson and the "Turra coo" was deservedly commemorated by a monument at his farm.

The cow was later sent to the Aberdeen market, where it was bought back by some farmers as a present for Paterson and the "Turra coo" was deservedly commemorated by a monument at his farm.
With this background a possible reduction in National Insurance contributions might be expect to put a smile on the faces of the employers of Banff and Buchan and elsewhere in Scotland. However, we are more likely to see modern-day remonstrations in Banff and Buchan against the introduction of the Climate Change Levy even with a possible NIC set-off.
As a result of the Kyoto Protocol the UK set itself a goal of a 20% cut in carbon dioxide emissions on 1990 levels by 2010. The UK proposes to start meeting its target with the CCL in 2001. This is not a simple environmental levy, but a tax expected to raise #1.75bn per year.
The CCL is to be calculated on the basis of the volume of kWhs of energy used by a business. The CCL will not encourage fuel switching and is thus less effective in environmental terms. Any business using gas, electricity, coal, or LPG could be hit with a possible 40% increase in energy costs, if this proposed legislation is enacted in its present form.
The revenue from the CCL will be used, in part, to finance a 0.5% reduction in the main rate of NIC met by employers. This will naturally, benefit businesses with a large payroll, a factor which does not necessarily equate with high energy usage. For instance, an industry estimate suggests that the public sector is expected to pay over #250m to get a rebate of #390m (156%): whereas farming will have a #26m bill and #9m rebate on the same basis. The dairy industry, among others, will not be happy on account of the high energy costs involved in milking equipment and heating byres.
Let us hope that the Government sees some sense and refrains from enacting yet another tax by the backdoor. There are far better environmental, as opposed to fiscal, measures to effect a cut in carbon-dioxide emissions. Otherwise, this time we may witness a whole herd of coos on the rampage in Turriff.

Blaming Disasters On Global Warming Doesn't Help

Abstract: It's tempting to blame climate change for the multibillion-dollar consequences of floods, hurricanes, droughts, tornadoes, hail and thunderstorms. During the past 25 years, financial losses from these and other natural disasters in the United States have averaged about $500 million per week and are mounting. Advocates of aggressive action to control global warming maintain that catastrophes will become increasingly likely if we do not take drastic steps to curtail fossil-fuel consumption and emission of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. Vice President Al Gore, who keeps telling people that global warming is dangerous, attributed the devastating 1997 flood on the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota to a combination of El Nino and climate change. Earlier this year, Gore said that record high temperatures provide "more evidence" that man-made heat-trapping greenhouse gases are leading to long-term climate change. It's true that human beings are producing more greenhouse gases now than before, and that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are at higher levels than they have been for millennia. But much of the debate over global warming is really beside the point, because the key assumption -- that there is a scientific consensus on climate change -- is false. In fact, many mainstream scientists say there is insufficient knowledge of the magnitude of natural climatic variations, especially solar radiation and ocean currents, to gauge how large the human impact is by comparison.

It's true that human beings are producing more greenhouse gases now than before, and that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are at higher levels than they have been for millennia. But much of the debate over global warming is really beside the point, because the key assumption -- that there is a scientific consensus on climate change -- is false. In fact, many mainstream scientists say there is insufficient knowledge of the magnitude of natural climatic variations, especially solar radiation and ocean currents, to gauge how large the human impact is by comparison.
More to the point, the inherent complexity of the global warming issue suggests that there might be greater benefit in mobilizing public and private resources to deal with extreme weather. A recent study bears this out.
The study, conducted by a panel of the National Academy of Sciences, shows a decrease in fatalities from extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods during the past 20 years, yet an increase in property losses. The study found that sharply higher dollar losses in recent years were due in large part to demographic shifts. For one thing, there has been a steady migration of people to more vulnerable coastal areas as well as to more densely populated metropolitan regions where even
small storms can do major damage. Human encroachment has reduced the ability of natural environmental systems to provide protection from extreme weather. Other contributing factors are the nation's population growth and the fact that per capita incomes are higher today than they were even two decades ago, making the potential losses larger.
One central problem is that the public increasingly looks to insurance to compensate for losses from many types of risk-taking behavior such as building homes, high-rise condominiums and office buildings on steep hillsides. However, the insurance industry already has problems providing coverage in areas subject to catastrophic losses because many insurers do not have the resources to pay for a worst-case event. Furthermore, the current regulatory system makes it difficult to aggregate adequate capital to cover low-frequency but high-consequence events.
And even when insurance is available, most property owners do not buy coverage against special perils, notably earthquakes and floods. For example, nationwide only about 20 percent of the homes exposed to floods have flood insurance. Many people assume that federal disaster assistance will function as a kind of hazard insurance, but such aid is almost always limited. And even when larger amounts are available, they are usually offered in the form of loans, not outright grants.
This suggests that the first priority should be adaptation -- developing strategies to cope with hurricanes, tornadoes and violent storms. The best way to reduce the risk of future catastrophes is for communities to take long-term, comprehensive looks at the dangers facing them. Communities that are built on flood plains, shorelines and other disaster-prone areas should decide what losses they are willing to accept, and devise suitable strategies to keep them within those limits.
Unfortunately, not enough is being done to prevent construction in low-lying areas that have been flooded repeatedly in the past. This is shortsighted, and communities will keep tempting fate by building more densely and dangerously in disaster-prone areas.
A higher priority should be placed on using government funds to purchase threatened properties. After the 1993 Mississippi floods, the Federal Emergency Management Agency launched a buyout program for vulnerable properties. When the floods returned in 1995, the cost to the federal government for disaster relief dropped sharply. For every dollar FEMA put in, it saved $2 or more.
These numbers should bring home a clear message to Americans: More efficient use of land and space is essential. Preventing development in hazard-prone areas requires wise land-use management -- especially controls to protect natural environmental resources such as sand dunes, wetlands and mangrove stands that mitigate damage. The best way to do this is to rely on local government.
Everyone has a stake in seeking to forge local consensus on land-use planning. The sooner people take responsibility for coping with natural hazards instead of hand-wringing over the presumed perils of greenhouse gases, the quicker the benefits in sustainable development and disaster resiliency.

Comment and Analysis: Analysis; Labour's poll tax Plans to charge a levy on industrial energy may bring an end to the government's current honeymoon with big business

Abstract: The most avowedly pro-business Labour government ever is falling out with its friends in the boardrooms. It's not minimum wage, union recognition or working time. The issue is the `climate change levy' or energy tax and the seriousness of the breach is such that businesspeople are calling it Labour's version of the poll tax. On Tuesday no fewer than three ministers - Patricia Hewitt, Michael Meacher and John Battle - were deputed to meet executives before draft legislation is published in the autumn. Treasury min ister Hewitt sought to reassure them the planned tax is not meant to hit competitiveness. Business appears unmollified: tax on industrial energy is an affront to market capitalism. The levy, to start in 2001, was announced by Gordon Brown in the Budget. It is intended to help meet commitments made at the 1997 Kyoto summit to cut emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. It will take the form of a surcharge on what industry pays for power. But steel, chemicals and other high-energy industries warn of jobs lost abroad. They are pleading for more consultation and bigger concessions than the discount off the tax the government is offering steel and other big manufacturing industries.

Full text: The most avowedly pro-business Labour government ever is falling out with its friends in the boardrooms. It's not minimum wage, union recognition or working time.

On Tuesday no fewer than three ministers - Patricia Hewitt, Michael Meacher and John Battle - were deputed to meet executives before draft legislation is published in the autumn. Treasury min ister Hewitt sought to reassure them the planned tax is not meant to hit competitiveness. Business appears unmollified: tax on industrial energy is an affront to market capitalism.
The levy, to start in 2001, was announced by Gordon Brown in the Budget. It is intended to help meet commitments made at the 1997 Kyoto summit to cut emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. It will take the form of a surcharge on what industry pays for power. But steel, chemicals and other high-energy industries warn of jobs lost abroad. They are pleading for more consultation and bigger concessions than the discount off the tax the government is offering steel and other big manufacturing industries.
Industry's complaints are not merely self-serving. They have been backed up by the Commons' trade and industry committee, which earlier this month described the proposed tax as `a blunt instrument' which could damage the economy. It was sympathetic to the argument that the levy will take from manufacturing industry and give to services.
Keen to avoid accusations of back-door taxation, the treasury promised from that cash raised would be `recycled', ensuring that there is no overall benefit to the exchequer. The pounds 1.7bn likely to be raised will be handed back in lower (0.5% off) national insurance contributions by employers, so firms with large staffs get the most, while the capital-intensive industries - which are also the heaviest energy users - get least.
The government's formula is based on the approach taken by the European Commission. Scandinavian countries have led the way in using taxes to reduce pollution, while Austria, the Netherlands and Italy have also joined in the green tax rush. In Germany, the Schroder coalition introduced a new energy tax in April, with the aim of raising prices in order to boost energy saving - receipts are to be used to cut both employer and employee contributions to pensions insurance. Both generators and suppliers of electricity are being taxed, while petrol and other fuel duties are also being raised. Renewable sources of energy are exempt. German manufacturers are getting an 80% discount following a heated lobbying campaign - firms were already annoyed at the coalition's plans to phase out nuclear energy.
When they are not arguing about the principle of the levy, British industrialists want changes. They say it should focus on the carbon content of fuel, not the energy content. This would have the effect of exempting nuclear, renewable and highly efficient combined heat and power generation (but pose a problem for Labour, which traditionally likes coal). Business also wants tax proceeds to be used directly to pay for energy saving investment.
Instead of a tax, industry would prefer permitted ceilings on pollution and some mechanism for trading the permits. Companies which found it easy to meet their targets might sell their permits: businesses would be making a conscious decision whether energy saving investment was cheaper than buying permission to pollute.
Industry also complains that household consumers are by far the least energy efficient, yet the tax will not apply to them. Having kept the rate of Vat on home energy at 5% chancellor Brown is reluctant - even in the cause of saving the planet - to push it up. Evidence from abroad is mixed on how much of an impact an energy tax would have. Swedish studies show energy reductions. Here, Cambridge Econometrics predicts this week that the levy will work. The table (left) shows its likely effect on emissions, with carbon dioxide being cut by 2.2m tonnes by 2010, well above previous government hopes of a 1.5m tonne cut.
This study will please the industrialists by suggesting the initial impact on business could be lessened if the starting rate of tax were cut. But it also says that the rate should then escalate to maintain the impact. And, controversially, these experts argue that high energy users should get less sympathy from the government: products and processes which are energy intensive need to be discouraged, if serious inroads are going to be made in their emissions. The logic applies to the discount offered man ufacturers - it should probably be more than the 50% that the government proposes, not more as the industrialists have been arguing.
Ministers have promised to look at increasing the discount, but there seems little chance they will move to meet industry demands for 95% off. The government will make concessions: it will exempt renewable energy sources as well as combined heat and power plants, and will use some of the tax raised as investment allowances. But there seems little chance the government will do what would be needed to restore New Labour's relations with industry to its honeymoon days.

Full text: Concessions made by the government yesterday on the controversial energy tax failed to defuse what has become the biggest row so far between industry and ministers.
Patricia Hewitt, the treasury minister responsible for the Climate Change Levy, met the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) with environment minister Michael Meacher and energy minister John Battle.
Ms Hewitt announced that fuel used as a raw material in chemical, steel and aluminium processes would be exempted.
Mr Meacher said the concessions meant the steel industry would pay a maximum of pounds 70m a year, not the pounds 238m claimed by the industry. But he insisted the levy would still raise the planned pounds 1.75bn and cut carbon dioxide emissions by the 3m tonnes predicted.
Ms Hewitt said the government would consider widen ing the number of sectors able to negotiate tax discounts for agreeing to reduce pollution. It might also decide to use some of the cash raised to fund investment in energy-saving equipment.
However, Lisa Waters, economic adviser to the EIUG, said the ministers had failed to convince industrialists that companies were going far enough. `We want fiscal neutrality for each sector, which means discounts up to 95% and a better way of recycling the tax than through national insurance,' she said.
`It is not enough and still leaves businesses with huge tax bills.'
Industrialists' opposition to the planned Climate Change Levy, to be introduced in 2001, was backed by the National Farmers' Union yesterday.
The NFU echoed warnings that the levy would hit employment and called for exemption for farmers.

Abstract: MINISTERS' plans to bring in an energy tax on businesses would hit the West Midlands hardest and cost more than 19,000 jobs, a major new report claims. About one worker in a hundred in the region would be put on the dole by the policy which would affect not only manufacturers, but high skill jobs in business services too, according to research by economic consultants Business Strategies. The report says 156,000 jobs throughout Britain are under threat over the next decade from the Government's proposed climate change levy, due to be introduced from 2001.

Full text: MINISTERS' plans to bring in an energy tax on businesses would hit the West Midlands hardest and cost more than 19,000 jobs, a major new report claims.
About one worker in a hundred in the region would be put on the dole by the policy which would affect not only manufacturers, but high skill jobs in business services too, according to research by economic consultants Business Strategies.
The report says 156,000 jobs throughout Britain are under threat over the next decade from the Government's proposed climate change levy, due to be introduced from 2001.
But there is a growing belief that the shock ripples will be felt throughout the economy and not just focus on low skills work.
Significant opposition is growing to implementing the new tax with the Confederation of British Industry launching a campaign to alter the most "damaging" features.
MPs have also voiced fears over the extra costs to industry, believing it could turn into "Labour's poll tax".
But the Business Strategies study, commissioned by the UK Steel Association, Engineering Employers' Federation and Chemical Industries Association, is the first serious work into demonstrating what can be expected if the plans are not altered.
Among its key findings are:
Britain's gross domestic product could be slashed by pounds 11 billion over ten years;
Productivity is expected to fall by 0.8 per cent;
The north/south divide will worsen, and;
Balance of payments will suffer.
Neil Blake, Business Strategies research director, said: "As well as job losses, this levy will hit productivity and skill levels in the UK.
"One effect of the tax is to reduce high skilled/high value-added jobs and increase low skilled/low value-added jobs."
The levy, in part offset by a cut in employers' National Insurance contributions, would be structured so that the greatest impact would be felt on energy intensive firms, typically in the chemicals, metals and engineering sectors.

Abstract: Sir, With the government rightly emphasising the quality and effectiveness of the delivery of its policies, it is regrettable that the proposed climate change levy will not fulfil its potential in tackling the threat of global climate change and creating more jobs. Better designed, it could direct resources to the best opportunities for increasing energy efficiency, create many more jobs in this field and in tackling energy poverty - overshadowing the effect of reduced employers' National Insurance contributions - and mitigate the threat to the competitiveness of energy-dependent UK manufacturing companies.

Full text: From Mr David Varney.
Sir, With the government rightly emphasising the quality and effectiveness of the delivery of its policies, it is regrettable that the proposed climate change levy will not fulfil its potential in tackling the threat of global climate change and creating more jobs.
Better designed, it could direct resources to the best opportunities for increasing energy efficiency, create many more jobs in this field and in tackling energy poverty - overshadowing the effect of reduced employers' National Insurance contributions - and mitigate the threat to the competitiveness of energy-dependent UK manufacturing companies.
The problem lies in the levy's perverse investment incentives for the two types of business energy user. Even with partial exemptions, heavy users face a severe threat to their competitiveness. Yet they are already acutely conscious of energy efficiency and are most likely to have invested accordingly.
For most businesses, energy use is limited, and the levy's incentive would be blunted by savings from reduced employers' NICs. This is crucial because advancing technology means that attractive energy-saving opportunities are becoming available to many smaller energy users, for example small-scale combined heat and power (CHP) applications, and, without incentives, such companies prefer to invest in core activities.
Instead of the proposed form of levy, the unit rates should be carbon reflective, and the levy should be introduced alongside tradeable carbon tax credits for designated energy-saving investments, for example CHP, renewable energy projects and energy poverty programmes. Companies facing a threat to their competitiveness would then be able to intermediate with those with the prime opportunities for low-cost accredited energy savings. Eradicating energy poverty alone would save some 4m tonnes a year of carbon, against the levy's total target of 1.5m tonnes a year. Moreover, as BG Transco's pilot work has shown, eradicating energy poverty from more than 4m homes is economically viable because the fuel savings would more than justify the investment.
A scheme on these lines would underpin the UK's climate change programme, paving the way to the development of environmental trading as a substantial activity and capability - to the long-term benefit of our economy.

Our changing world ; In which our designated reader peruses some of the highlights from the season's science bookshelf, trying to make sense of the bewildering pace of change that besets us: [1 Edition]

Abstract: The scientists have discovered, for instance, a fruit fly gene dubbed clock that governs when the creatures are active. Mess with the gene and you get night-owl fruit flies or insomniac fruit- flies. Most humans are wakeful in the morning, nod off a bit in the afternoon and then are alert again until 10 or 11 p.m. This is probably governed partly by culture and partly by genetics, [Jonathan Weiner] suggests. [Seymour Benzer] himself has always begun work about noon and laboured far into the night - perhaps, he thinks, because of a genetic error in the human version of clock. Water everywhere and not a drop to drink. That lament, from "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," is Torontonian Marq de Villiers' theme in Water (Stoddart, 413 pages, $34.95). As the population sky- rockets, pollution increases and water waste grows, will there be enough? The answer, bluntly, is no. Already, de Villiers points out, huge areas of the world are in "water stress" - there's barely enough water for drinking, washing and sanitation. As their population grows, those areas will tip over into water shortages. At the same time, places like Canada have enormous amounts of excess water, even though - as Ontario lake levels this spring showed - we can have local dry spells. [Brian Greene] is one of the leaders in a new theory - dubbed superstring theory - that may be able to solve that and other outstanding problems. The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, And The Quest For The Ultimate Theory (Norton, 448 pages, $39.99) tells how that theory developed under the lash of what one might call "scientific selection" - the realization that existing theories have nasty flaws.

volution, as Charles Darwin thought of it, meant change under the unrelenting whip of natural selection. But there are other kinds of change. Today, for instance, we have artificial selection in the lab, using nature's own evolutionary mechanisms. We also have change in natural systems, which might be thought of as evolutionary experiments in action. The books here are thematically diverse, but they all have some sort of change, whether good or bad, as an underlying theme.
A new book by Pulitzer prize-winner Jonathan Weiner is something to leap upon with glad cries, not only for his excellent prose but for his insight into what, in our times, makes an important story. He won the Pulitzer for The Beak Of The Finch, which updated the story of the finches of the Galapagos Islands, famous for their role in sparking Darwin's theory of natural selection.
Time, Love, Memory: A Great Biologist And His Quest For The Origins Of Behaviour (Random House, 300 pages, $36.95) also is about biology - the nascent science of molecular behaviour - and could easily add another Pulitzer to Weiner's trophy case.
The central player in Time, Love, Memory is Seymour Benzer, one of the century's top biologists and a fairly odd duck in his own right. Benzer's elegant experiments with fruit flies paved the way for all those stories we read about genes for manic-depression or homosexuality or thrill-seeking. There's now no doubt that, in fruit flies, mice and other creatures, relatively simple genetics controls some very complicated behaviour.
How human behaviour is controlled is still unclear but, as Weiner points out, we share much of our genetics with mice, fruit flies and even bacteria. It isn't a huge stretch to imagine that genetic differences underlie much of our diversity.
The scientists have discovered, for instance, a fruit fly gene dubbed clock that governs when the creatures are active. Mess with the gene and you get night-owl fruit flies or insomniac fruit- flies. Most humans are wakeful in the morning, nod off a bit in the afternoon and then are alert again until 10 or 11 p.m. This is probably governed partly by culture and partly by genetics, Weiner suggests. Benzer himself has always begun work about noon and laboured far into the night - perhaps, he thinks, because of a genetic error in the human version of clock.
But Time, Love, Memory is far more than a simple biography; it also offers insights into what the news from the world of genetics means - and what it doesn't mean.
Water everywhere and not a drop to drink. That lament, from "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," is Torontonian Marq de Villiers' theme in Water (Stoddart, 413 pages, $34.95). As the population sky- rockets, pollution increases and water waste grows, will there be enough? The answer, bluntly, is no. Already, de Villiers points out, huge areas of the world are in "water stress" - there's barely enough water for drinking, washing and sanitation. As their population grows, those areas will tip over into water shortages. At the same time, places like Canada have enormous amounts of excess water, even though - as Ontario lake levels this spring showed - we can have local dry spells.
In fact, de Villiers says, it's not unlikely that wars over water will be fought in the near future. The Middle East, already a powder keg, is one of the most water-stressed areas in the world, and the various national rivals must depend on each other for water since they share the few rivers in the area.
The southern republics of the former Soviet Union are also short on water, and prepared to squabble. The picture is equally gloomy in many other places.
De Villiers, a well-known journalist and author, makes the key point early in the book: They aren't making any more water. We depend on a tiny fraction of the water on the planet - the fresh water - and we have access to only a tiny fraction of that. It would make sense to husband the resource, but we do not, mainly because, for most of history, there was enough to go around and so our laws and customs aren't adapted to shortage. In some places, de Villiers says, laws actively encourage waste and in most places, there's no incentive to be frugal.
Despite the gloom and doom, this is not an unhopeful book. De Villiers' avoids a hectoring tone; like a good journalist, he strives for balance, which is, after all, the most convincing way to make an argument. And he does find some cause for hope. The Rhine River - long the sewer of Europe - is starting to rebound after strict pollution controls were instituted.
The Mideast, despite the possibility of water wars, has so far kept back from the brink. But if there's cause for hope, the ruined Aral Sea - drained to destruction by Soviet irrigation schemes - gives point to the main message: Water is life, and we're mucking it up.
Everybody talks about the weather, Mark Twain famously said, but no one does anything about it. Lydia Dotto's excellently argued thesis in Storm Warning: Gambling With The Climate Of Our Planet (Doubleday Canada, 332 pages, $34.95) is that Twain was wrong - we are doing something about it. The problem is that we really don't know what we're doing or what the consequences will be.
The issue of global climate change, as Dotto presents it, is that we are conducting an experiment in weather evolution whose outcome is unclear. What is clear is that so-called anthropogenic effects on the world's climate - those caused by human activity - are beyond doubt, although skeptics still demand absolute proof, both of the effects and the potential for harm. Some even go so far as to suggest that more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will be a good thing, because plants will flourish and the Earth will become a garden of delights.
Dotto argues cogently that this Pollyanna view is wrong-headed; over-all, climate change is not likely to be a good thing, although there will be winners and losers. The demand for absolute proof is, for the most part, a brilliant and self-interested strategy of delay on the part of industries and other interests that will lose out if we start to control greenhouse gas emissions. The real question, Dotto says, is the one we ask ourselves when we buy insurance: Although we have no proof that our houses are likely to burn down, doesn't it make sense to prepare for the worst?
In her introduction to Unnatural Harvest: How Corporate Science Is Secretly Altering Our Food (Doubleday Canada, 278 pages, $32.95), Winnipegger Ingeborg Boyens says she "aspires to provoke a debate" on the benefits and risks of modern agricultural biotechnology, a kind of artificial evolution. Her method, however, is akin to provoking a debate on emergency exits by shouting "Fire!" in a crowded theatre.
Agricultural biotechnology begins this book as a villain, created by irresponsible eggheads and sold by irresponsible marketers, and that's the way it ends. Unnatural Harvest mixes nostalgia for the family farm and the good old days with a heaping helping of fear of the unknown and more than a trace of demonization.
"Scientists" come in for much of the demonization. In a discussion of various genetic manipulations, Boyens writes: "However bizarre or unsavoury such manipulations might seem to lay people, scientists maintain there is nothing frightening or unnatural about jumbling up genes from different species." Get it? We ordinary people think this stuff is weird and scary, but those old devil scientists are out of control. The fact she quotes other scientists as being cautious about or even opposed to agricultural biotech seems lost on her.
Boyens also seems to think that making a profit is a bad thing. The products of agricultural biotechnology are being sold to make money, she reveals breathlessly, rather than to benefit mankind. Boyens even seems shocked to discover that a modern-day dairy farm in Wisconsin has "no room for unproductive sentiment" about its cuddly wee calves; the "farm philosophy is about the bottom line" and the male calves are headed for market as soon as possible.
It's a pity Boyens succumbed to the temptation to monger fear, because there's a good book here struggling to get out. It is not sufficient for anybody to say "trust us" about new technology; we need an informed debate. People remember, all too well, that PCBs, now linked to cancer, were once thought to be so safe that corporate spokesmen would demonstrate by drinking them. CFCs, now busily destroying the ozone layer, were miracle chemicals; no one thought to ask what effect they'd have when they percolated to the top of the atmosphere. We should not take biotech on trust.
As well, the issue of corporate control of science, of scientific knowledge becoming intellectual property, is one that has bothered many people for years. That issue is especially acute in biotechnology because, as Boyens correctly points out, it's possible that decisions taken in a boardroom somewhere will have a serious impact on our lives. But her us-versus-them approach is unlikely to spark any real debate.
Just as we're getting used to the Big Bang, along comes Brian Greene, a physics professor at New York's Columbia University, to show us how scientists are getting ready to abandon the idea in the face of a new theory of how things work.
A major problem for physics has been to reconcile Einstein's relativity, which holds sway in the world as we know it, with the odd happenings in the quantum mechanical microworld.
Both theories work amazingly well, in their own spheres, but they're incompatible. And one place they would have come together is the Big Bang, which has puzzled researchers ever since it was first proposed. What actually happens when the entire universe is crushed down into an infinitely dense, infinitely hot point? Neither relativity nor quantum mechanics gives an answer.
Greene is one of the leaders in a new theory - dubbed superstring theory - that may be able to solve that and other outstanding problems. The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, And The Quest For The Ultimate Theory (Norton, 448 pages, $39.99) tells how that theory developed under the lash of what one might call "scientific selection" - the realization that existing theories have nasty flaws.
The new theory suggests that elementary particles - electrons and the like - are actually tiny strings, rather than points. And they move in a world that has 10 dimensions plus time - not our familiar three and time - but with seven of those dimensions so tiny we can't notice them.
The theorists are hoping that some variation of these odd notions may resolve the clash between quantum mechanics and relativity, but it's still a work in progress. At the moment, Green points out, there are several competing theories, and it's not clear which is correct. It may even be that they are all part of an ever grander scheme called M theory.
Actually understanding superstrings, unfortunately, would take years of training and a mathematical turn of mind. And that's why The Elegant Universe is such a tour de force: with nary an equation (well, I think he mentions Einstein's famous E=mc2 once or twice) Greene conveys the essence of the theory so well a layman can understand what problems it tries to solve, why and how. His language is clear and easy to understand.
That said, this is not a book to skim. Let your attention wander and you'll find yourself lost in space.

Industry in revolt over energy tax

Abstract: THE controversial industrial energy tax is likely to hit most British companies even harder than originally planned because of a discount expected to be given to Britain's biggest energy users. The climate change levy, as it is officially known, will be neutral in that it raises pounds 1.7 billion from the use of energy, but gives industry a rebate of the same sum by cutting employers' national insurance contributions. The Treasury source insisted that whatever discounts are given to big users, `the tax will remain neutral'. Firms that are more fuel-efficient would have to make up the difference either by paying a bigger tax on energy use or having a reduced rebate.

Full text: THE controversial industrial energy tax is likely to hit most British companies even harder than originally planned because of a discount expected to be given to Britain's biggest energy users.
Representatives of the steel, cement, and chemical industries are meeting with government ministers this week to argue that they should be exempt from the tax so as not to harm their international competitiveness.
The meeting will heighten the Prime Minister's concerns that the levy is creat ing ill feeling towards the Government in industrial circles, and could increase tensions between Numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street.
Intensive energy users have already rejected an offer of a 50 per cent discount on the tax equivalent to around pounds 300 million. But a Treasury source said even that would mean higher bills for other businesses. If high energy users are let off, `other people will have to pick up the tab'.
The climate change levy, as it is officially known, will be neutral in that it raises pounds 1.7 billion from the use of energy, but gives industry a rebate of the same sum by cutting employers' national insurance contributions. The Treasury source insisted that whatever discounts are given to big users, `the tax will remain neutral'. Firms that are more fuel-efficient would have to make up the difference either by paying a bigger tax on energy use or having a reduced rebate.
The tax has caused an unprecedented storm of protest from industry, which claimed last week it could cost 150,000 jobs. The House of Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee condemned it as being `a blunt instrument'.
This Tuesday, industry groups, including the UK Steel Association, will tell ministers that the 50 per cent exemption is dwarfed by discounts of between 80 and 100 per cent on levies in Europe. They also say that even the discounted tax will cost them pounds 3.20 on every tonne of steel produced three times higher than the cost for the next highest country, Italy.
A UK Steel Association spokesman said: `We are negotiating with the Government about making reductions to greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Kyoto climate summit. To have an energy tax lumped on top is unacceptable.'
The steelmakers' call for a total rebate will be backed up by the Chemical Industries Association, which is objecting to an estimated pounds 140m tax across its own industry.
A government source said: `This is a process of negotiation in which predictable people are saying predictable things. There is no point in an energy tax that doesn't tax the biggest users of energy.

Abstract: Facts, Not Fears, however, doesn't live up to the high standards of accuracy, balance and disclosure of bias it wants to demand of its targets. This is a book that is seriously flawed by factual inaccuracy, selective handling of evidence and sources, special pleading and selective inattention to inconvenient data. Such flaws are particularly evident in the book's treatment of air pollution and global warming/climate change issues. The air pollution problem, we are flatly assured, has already been solved. Global warming isn't happening or, if it is happening, it's a natural phenomenon and has nothing to do with the greenhouse gases produced by our century-and- a-half bonfire of fossil fuels burnt in factories and vehicles. Besides, "scientists are divided" about global warming, so it would be a public policy disaster to bring in any regulations or reforms that might interfere with unrestricted expansion of the industries - - coal, oil and automobile -- identified as most responsible for human-caused increases in greenhouse gases, and, thereby, catastrophic changes in the world's weather patterns. Over the last decade, it has become increasingly difficult to deny that human activity is driving up concentrations of greenhouse gases, increasing global average temperatures, and creating ever- wilder extremes of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a UN body that reflects the work of thousands of the world's best climate scientists, weighed in on this subject in 1995. They wrote that "the balance of evidence suggests there is a discernable human influence on global climate." In 1992, over 1700 scientists around the world , including 104 Nobel Laureates -- a majority of living prize winners in science -- issued a "Warning to Humanity" that directly addressed the global warming/climate change issue. They said "We must, for example, move away from fossil fuels to more benign, inexhaustible energy sources to cut greenhouse gas emissions and the pollution of our air and water." Even economists and some business leaders are beginning to face the dangers of global warming/climate change. In 1997, more than two thousand prominent economists, including six Nobel prize winners such as James Tobin and Kenneth Arrow endorsed a statement sponsored by the U.S. group Redefining Progress that read, in part, "As economists, we believe that global climate change carries with it significant environmental, economic c social and geopolitical risks, and that preventative steps are justified." Even John Browne, CEO of British Petroleum and Chris Fay, Chairman of Shell UK, have, in the past few years, broken ranks to agree that the time for preventative action is now.

Full text: FACTS, NOT FEARS: TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT
By Michael Sanera and Jane S. Shaw
Adapted for Canadian readers by Liv Fredericksen and Laura Jones
Foreward by Patrick Moore
The Fraser Institute, 308 pp., $19.95
Chicken Little, the feckless heroine in the children's book, thought the sky was falling. In the story, she was enthusiastic, sincere and wrong. Facts, Not Fears co-authors Michael Sanera and Jane S. Shaw argue that Chicken Little has taken over your kids' school. In the form of fear-mongering ecological alarmists and biased, one-sided text books, the Chicken Little brigades are busy, they warn, filling innocent minds with junk science and dangerous impulses toward lives of ecological activism.
The authors, associated with the Alabama Family Alliance, believe that primary and highschool science classes have become brainwashing sessions, designed to turn our kids into frightened, confused pawns in a larger political game, a game driven by hostility to business, a perverse lust for government regulation and a Luddite despair about the promise of technology and the future of human civilization. The American text has been given a Canadian spin by Jones and Fredericksen, staff members at Vancouver's Fraser Institute, and they see the situation as equally dire in the Canadian schools.
The book takes up, one by one, fourteen claims about current or upcoming environmental disaster. All these claims the authors take to be false or exaggerated. They quote from a pile of public school textbooks they have examined, and highlight in these books what the authors take to be over-blown assertions of environmental trouble on fronts ranging from global warming and climate change to garbage disposal and recycling, from air pollution to the hole in the ozone. On all these warnings about environmental crisis, the authors views, are consistent; a) there is no problem, or b) it has already been fixed, or c) the only proper way to fix it is to rely on the workings of the market.
The sky isn't falling, parents are reassured. Governments across North America are squandering tax dollars on environmental education, according to Sanera, Shaw, Fredericksen and Jones, that is factually inaccurate, hysterical in tone, and bad for the children's peace of mind and the economy's growth.
It will surprise no one to find such a pro-market, anti- government tone in a publication of the Fraser Institute; most of its documents proudly declare that its aim is "to re-direct the attention of Canadians to the role of markets in providing for their well being." Now, to be clear, I do not share the Institute's view on such matters. I am currently writing a book of my own, a book that takes a green tinged look at the environmental crises the authors of Facts, Not Fears dismiss as nonexistent, and I have become convinced that under-regulated industries and the gasoline powered private automobile rank high in any environmental rogue's gallery. Further, I have, over the years, contributed money and effort to some environmental organizations.
None of this leads me to dismiss out of hand all the arguments advanced by this book. Certainly some of the passages they quote from current text books make them sound guilty of over-statement, over-generalization and extremely bad prose style. Those of us who are concerned about environmental collapse do sometimes fall into a strident, apocalyptic tone; when this is married to the typical sins against language found in many text books, the results can often be unfortunate, and Facts, Not Fears is richly ornamented with quotations that seem to illustrate this. These failures of style and precision, however, when they are not artifacts of selective, out of context quotation, seem, on balance, more goofy than sinister.
Facts, Not Fears argues that teachers should present all science, including environmental science, as an open, growing system of developing theory, not as a set of permanently finished debates and certainties carved in stone. No fair minded parent or tax paying citizen could want anything less from education. Similarly, most readers will be ready to support Sanera's and Shaw's demand that text books provide more detailed notes and references that would allow their content to be critically evaluated. This might be a little cumbersome in a Grade Six science book, but would certainly be welcome in accompanying teacher's guides.
Facts, Not Fears, however, doesn't live up to the high standards of accuracy, balance and disclosure of bias it wants to demand of its targets. This is a book that is seriously flawed by factual inaccuracy, selective handling of evidence and sources, special pleading and selective inattention to inconvenient data. Such flaws are particularly evident in the book's treatment of air pollution and global warming/climate change issues. The air pollution problem, we are flatly assured, has already been solved. Global warming isn't happening or, if it is happening, it's a natural phenomenon and has nothing to do with the greenhouse gases produced by our century-and- a-half bonfire of fossil fuels burnt in factories and vehicles. Besides, "scientists are divided" about global warming, so it would be a public policy disaster to bring in any regulations or reforms that might interfere with unrestricted expansion of the industries - - coal, oil and automobile -- identified as most responsible for human-caused increases in greenhouse gases, and, thereby, catastrophic changes in the world's weather patterns.
Over the last decade, it has become increasingly difficult to deny that human activity is driving up concentrations of greenhouse gases, increasing global average temperatures, and creating ever- wilder extremes of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a UN body that reflects the work of thousands of the world's best climate scientists, weighed in on this subject in 1995. They wrote that "the balance of evidence suggests there is a discernable human influence on global climate." In 1992, over 1700 scientists around the world , including 104 Nobel Laureates -- a majority of living prize winners in science -- issued a "Warning to Humanity" that directly addressed the global warming/climate change issue. They said "We must, for example, move away from fossil fuels to more benign, inexhaustible energy sources to cut greenhouse gas emissions and the pollution of our air and water."
Even economists and some business leaders are beginning to face the dangers of global warming/climate change. In 1997, more than two thousand prominent economists, including six Nobel prize winners such as James Tobin and Kenneth Arrow endorsed a statement sponsored by the U.S. group Redefining Progress that read, in part, "As economists, we believe that global climate change carries with it significant environmental, economic c social and geopolitical risks, and that preventative steps are justified." Even John Browne, CEO of British Petroleum and Chris Fay, Chairman of Shell UK, have, in the past few years, broken ranks to agree that the time for preventative action is now.
Here are just a few of the facts that can lead to such statements of alarm. The hottest ten years on record have all happened since 1987. World sea levels have risen between four and ten inches in the last century. In tropical oceans, a one degree centigrade increase in average water temperature has been enough to kill the vital algae symbionts that give coral reefs their life and colour. Seventy to ninety percent of the coral in the Indian Ocean is already dead, and thousands of kilometres of reef are bleached and dying in the western Pacific.
Meanwhile, catastrophic weather events linked to global warming - - floods, droughts, hurricanes, ices storms -- are killing and scattering more human populations all the time, and (surely an impact that should concern the economists at the Fraser Institute) driving insurance payments for such damage to unprecedented heights. Last year, for example, insurance companies paid out more for weather damage than they had in the entire decade of the 1980s.
Are scientists divided about the relationship between human produced greenhouse gases, global warming and climate change, as Facts, Not Fears maintains? No, not to any significant degree. It is true enough that a small group of scientists, many of whom have received major funding from coal and petroleum industry sources, continue to express skepticism about these linkages. But it is also true that you can find or hire scientists to support flat earth or creation science positions.
What distinguishes skeptics about the global warming/climate change from other scientific eccentrics is that their positions are taken in the context of a world debate about public policy. Canada and other western nations committed at Kyoto in 1997 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; so far there have been few concrete steps taken anywhere in the industrial world to attain the modest emission cut goals set then. If the positions championed by the Fraser Institute and its house experts prevail, we will do little or nothing to reduce our contribution to climate change, and our children will suffer the consequences.
As counterspin to this position, Facts Not Fears offers, for example, the table of figures, on page 162, triumphantly headlined "Air Pollution is Decreasing Nationally." There are two points to make about this table, and the polemic weight it is called upon to bear in supporting the authors' contentions. One is that the reductions in some pollutants that are recorded in this table are the direct result of the very process of environmental activism and government regulation the rest of the book dismisses as hysterical and oppressive. The petroleum industry didn't remove lead from North American gasoline without a lot of corporate foot dragging and public pressure.
The other point worth noting, as the text of Facts, Not Fears fails to do, is that while some elements of air pollution may have been reduced, ground level ozone, the key component of photochemical smog, is up by over 30 per cent. Ozone irritates the mucous membranes, reduces resistance to colds and pneumonia, impairs lung function and aggravates chronic heart disease, asthma, bronchitis and emphysema. One would think that a one-third increase in the levels of such a dangerous pollutant would merit at least some mention.
The authors of Facts, Not Fears are equally silent on recent Canadian federal studies that estimate that air pollution causes up to 16,000 premature deaths a year in this country. Besides, if we continue to multiply the number of high pollution SUVs on the road (last year these smoky, steroid-enhanced go-karts represented more than half the new vehicles sold in the U.S. and Canada) the air pollution gains recorded will soon disappear.
Facts, Not Fear misses plenty of other chances to come fully clean. The author of the book's fawningly enthusiastic forward, Dr. Patrick Moore, for example, is identified as "father and environmentalist," and as co-founder and former president of the environmental group Greenpeace. Surely simple honesty should have required that his more recent career as a paid spokesman for a forest industry group that has been actively at war with environmental groups be mentioned as well.
Nonetheless, this is a book parents and citizens should read and understand. By all means we should consider the arguments of the authors, English literature and economics grads, about the state of the environment and environmental education. But that consideration should also involve a look at the work of serious scientists and science writers who have also addressed these issues, even without coal and petroleum industry grants. (An excellent first step in such a balanced consideration would be to read Facts, Not Fear in tandem with Ross Gelbspan's brilliant The Heat is On and Taking Our Breath Away by Dr. John Last, Dr. Konia Trouton and Dr. David Pengelly.) If nothing else, the appearance of this book and the larger assault on environmental education it represents should make all of us read and think more about these life and death issues.

Abstract: The treasury's planned energy tax will cost 156,000 jobs over the next 10 years, according to a study published today. It will add fuel to the blazing row over the proposal between industry and an avowedly pro-business government - the biggest dispute since Labour took office in May 1997. Manufacturing as a whole, the report says, will lose 95,000 jobs, 50,000 of them in engineering. The north-south divide will widen, with manufacturing regions such as Wales and the north-east hit harder. The west Midlands faces 20,000 losses, nearly 1% of jobs in the region.

Full text: The treasury's planned energy tax will cost 156,000 jobs over the next 10 years, according to a study published today.
It will add fuel to the blazing row over the proposal between industry and an avowedly pro-business government - the biggest dispute since Labour took office in May 1997.
Jobs will go in most business sectors - including up to 61,000 in service industries, which were expected to gain from the climate- change levy coming into force in 2001.
Manufacturing as a whole, the report says, will lose 95,000 jobs, 50,000 of them in engineering. The north-south divide will widen, with manufacturing regions such as Wales and the north-east hit harder. The west Midlands faces 20,000 losses, nearly 1% of jobs in the region.
The research, sponsored by the steel, engineering and chemical industries, and carried out by economic consultancy Business Strategies, comes ahead of a top-level meeting next week between the most threatened sectors and ministers from three government departments.
The crucial sectors, organised in the Energy Intensive Users group, hope to persuade treasury secretary Patricia Hewitt to delay the introduction of the tax and reduce its impact on manufacturing.
Martin Temple, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, said yesterday: `No other piece of proposed government legislation has appeared to discriminate so heavily against manufacturing industry.
`The levy will severely damage our competitiveness, drive production to less environmentally friendly economies and discourage the high value added investment the government is so keen to encourage," he added.
Some industrialists say they are determined to destroy the treasury's plans - which were introduced by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in the budget.
The levy is part of the government's strategy to achieve reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and other damaging gases, which were agreed at the Kyoto summit in 1997.
It aims to be neutral for the economy as a whole because the sums raised will be compensated for in the form of lower national insurance contributions for employers - probably a 0.5% cut.
But the research concludes that the impact of lower employment costs will be overwhelmed by lower investment in the UK's capital- intensive industries - which will have a knock-on effect on suppliers, including service companies.
The report's conclusions contradict a similar exercise recently carried out by Cambridge Econometrics which showed a significant net gain in jobs because of lower labour costs and investment in energy- saving equipment.

Full text:   The leader of the West Midlands' Labour MPs last night attacked the Government over a new tax which he said would put industry and jobs in the region at risk.
Mr Peter Snape (Lab West Bromwich E) called for Chancellor Gordon Brown to rethink the proposed tax on business use of gas, coal and electricity.
He warned it could be Labour's poll tax and unless the Government changed it he and other Midland Labour MPs might not support legislation putting it into practice.
Mr Snape ridiculed Mr Brown's claim that national insurance rebates meant the tax would be "revenue neutral" by not raising cash for the Treasury.
Speaking in a Commons debate, he said: "A revenue neutral tax is a creature I have never come across. It is a one-legged fish, a Loch Ness monster, a mythical figure."
Former railwayman Mr Snape, who has been a Labour MP for 25 years, highlighted the plight of aluminium company Sandwell Castings in his constituency.
The company will have to pay pounds 72,742 in the new tax, but will get a rebate of only pounds 17,019 through the 0.5 per cent cut in national insurance.
That would leave it pounds 55,723 out of pocket and facing a 14.4 per cent increase in fuel costs.
Mr Snape quoted the company's sales and marketing director, Mr Peter Green, who warned the tax would "export jobs" because British industry would suffer against foreign competitors.
Mr Green warned the tax threatened the existence of the company and the jobs of its 200 employees.
He said the implications of the tax were so severe that unless the Prime Minister was careful he would lose his place at the G8 because Britain would no longer qualify as an industrial country.
Mr Snape said the tax sounded like it had been dreamt up by "people who had never been inside a foundry in their lives".
He called for the Government to alter the tax so it would not make steel and other "metal bashing" industries in the West Midlands less competitive.
Mr Snape said the Government might call it the "climate change levy" but it would go down in history as the energy tax.
"Calling it the climate change levy is all very well, it is a bit like the community charge which was called the poll tax."
Mr Snape said British Steel was extremely concerned by the proposed tax and had warned it would cost the industry pounds 240 million and 5,000 jobs nationwide.
"I know it is the Government's aim to ensure that no legislation they pass has adverse effects on large companies like British Steel or small ones like Sandwell Castings.
"I have been here too long to make any threats, I have spent too long, nearly 20 years, sitting on those benches waiting for a Labour Government, but if the legislation appears in the way it is feared I will be unable to support its introduction."
Speaking outside the Chamber, Mr Snape said he thought other local Labour MPs would find it hard to support the tax.
He denied he was acting as a rebel but said: "The point is we were elected to defend our constituents and their jobs in the West Midlands and I think it would be remiss of me not to point out the dangers this will create."
The climate change levy was proposed in Mr Brown's last Budget.
It is intended to help meet Britain's commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions and will be introduced in April 2001 after a consultation period.
The Government expects it to raise about pounds 1.75 billion in its first year and save about 1.5 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010.
Economic Secretary to the Treasury Mrs Patricia Hewitt told the Commons last night that industry was being consulted about the tax and claimed it would not hit jobs.
"We will not sacrifice the competitiveness of our industry to our environmental goals. It would be madness to do so. If industry were to remove elsewhere, if greenhouse gases came from another country, we would have damaged our jobs without protectingour children and grandchildren," she said.
Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Mr David Heathcoat-Amory said the tax was an "environmental smokescreen" to raise money for the Treasury.
He said the Government was "addicted to taxes" despite Mr Blair's pre-election pledge not to raise them.
Mr Heathcoat-Amory said the Government was repeating its action towards the road haulage industry, which had been made uncompetitive in the European single market by rises in diesel duty and vehicle excise duty.
"I think what the Government are doing here is building on what they have already done to the British haulage industry.
"All that is being done behind an environmental smokescreen, but the real reason is to raise revenue," he said.
He added that the tax risked closing energy efficient plants in Britain and exporting jobs to inefficient plants abroad.

Commons committee criticises 'blunt instrument': [1 Edition]

Abstract: GORDON Brown's plans for an energy tax on industry has been attacked by MPs as a "blunt instrument" which could harm smaller companies and damage their competitiveness. The trade and industry select committee said yesterday that the Chancellor should rethink his proposed climate change levy, due to come into force in 2001, by introducing a more sophisticated tax regime and wider exemptions. Renewable energy, nuclear power and combined heat and power should be exempted or promoted by the levy, they said, effectively turning a levy on all industrial energy consumption into a carbon tax.

Full text:   GORDON Brown's plans for an energy tax on industry has been attacked by MPs as a "blunt instrument" which could harm smaller companies and damage their competitiveness.
The trade and industry select committee said yesterday that the Chancellor should rethink his proposed climate change levy, due to come into force in 2001, by introducing a more sophisticated tax regime and wider exemptions.
But the MPs also supported arguments from environmentalists that the levy should be linked more closely to the carbon content of fuels such as coal, gas and oil which directly add to global warming.
Renewable energy, nuclear power and combined heat and power should be exempted or promoted by the levy, they said, effectively turning a levy on all industrial energy consumption into a carbon tax.
The Treasury is to examine the committee's proposals as part of its work with the Department of Trade and Industry on the precise details of the levy, due to be unveiled by Mr Brown at the next Budget.
The proposals include a flat-rate levy on energy bills with firms getting back part of the extra costs through reduced national insurance bills and help with improving energy effi-ciency.
The Labour-dominated committee supported the Government's plans to cut the UK's CO_ emissions by the legally binding target of 12.5 per cent by 2010, agreed by the UN in 1997, and its preferred target of 20 per cent.
But the committee warned it was "not persuaded" that Government could set emissions reduction targets or effectively monitor or enforce the scheme for the great majority of small and medium-sized firms.
"Nor are we convinced that the Government is better able than the market to steer firms towards the energy efficiency improvements needed to cut emissions," the committee added.
The MPs added firmly: "We share the view expressed by several witnesses that, without appropriate modifications and exemptions, the levy could prove to be a blunt instrument which does considerable damage to sectors of the British economy already struggling to improve their profitability."

Abstract: Chancellor Gordon Brown's planned energy tax was yesterday criticised by MPs as a "blunt instrument" which threatened to damage industry at a time when it was struggling to maintain profits. Mr Brown announced his proposals to introduce the climate change levy - intended to cut emissions of environmentally damaging greenhouse gases - in his Budget last April.

Full text:   Chancellor Gordon Brown's planned energy tax was yesterday criticised by MPs as a "blunt instrument" which threatened to damage industry at a time when it was struggling to maintain profits.
Mr Brown announced his proposals to introduce the climate change levy - intended to cut emissions of environmentally damaging greenhouse gases - in his Budget last April.
He promised that the cash raised by the levy, which is due to come into force in 2001, would be recycled back to industry in the form of lower employers' national insurance contributions.
But a report yesterday by the Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee said the Government was going the wrong way about meeting its legally-binding commitment, made at the 1997 Kyoto summit, to cut emissions by 12.5 per cent by 2010.
The MPs warned that manufacturing industry was being made to bear the brunt of the cuts which threatened to undermine the competitiveness of British firms abroad.
"We have been disturbed by the unprecedented scale of the reaction to the Government's proposal," the report said. "We share the view that, without appropriate modifications and exemptions, the levy could prove a blunt instrument which does considerabledamage to sectors of the British economy already struggling to maintain their profitability."
The committee also accused the Government of a "logic deficit" in imposing the levy on all energy use and not just fossil fuels which are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions.
The MPs also rejected Mr Brown's assertion that the levy would be "revenue neutral", saying it would actually enable him to cut public spending through reduced public sector national insurance contributions.

Full text:   STEEL bosses are trying to convince the Government that a planned 'green' tax will decimate their industry and wipe out thousands of jobs.
They want Ministers to rethink the anti-pollution levy before Chancellor Gordon Brown announces final details in his autumn statement.
The new charge is aimed at encouraging factories to use less fuel, thus cutting the amount of 'greenhouse' gases such as carbon dioxide that are released into the atmosphere to help cause global warming.
But Britain's steel producers say such a move will add GBP 238million a year to their costs, allowing cheaper foreign rivals to grab trade.
They warn that steel plants would be bound to close, with experts estimating that at least 5,000 of the 60,000 steel employees would lose their jobs.
Their alarm was revealed as the cross-party Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee criticised the planned tax as a 'blunt instrument' threatening to damage other sections of British industry too.
Labour committed Britain to a 12.5 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010 at the 1997 world environment conference in Kyoto, Japan.
Although a wide range of industries will be affected, steel will be hit hardest by far.
The main producer, British
Steel, burns 9million tons of coal a year in the blast furnaces of its plants at Llanwern and Port Talbot in South Wales, and at Scunthorpe and Teesside.
And the heaviest green tax 49 per cent of the basic fuel cost will be imposed on coal-users.
Gas-using industries will face 40 per cent extra and electricity users 20 per cent.
Critics of the tax say it could also backfire and actually increase pollution worldwide.
Rupert Hodges, of the UK
Steel Association, said: 'This tax is perverse. Forty per cent of the world's steel is produced in countries which are not Kyoto signatories.
'It will knock out our own industry, while transferring Britain's business to them increasing global pollution.' Among the countries that did not sign up and will be exempt from green taxes are China, which produces more steel than any other, India and large parts of the former East European bloc.
They could increase their steel production, belching out more fumes than all the Kyoto signatories put together.
Mr Brown said in his March Budget that a Climate Change Levy the tax's official name would be imposed on major energy-using businesses in 2001 but would be open to 'consultation' until his autumn statement.
Employers' leaders are stepping up their campaign for a rethink.
'You have to be incredibly careful with this kind of energy tax,' said Richard Baron, of the Institute of Directors.
'It can go badly wrong, and this Government has done just that gone badly wrong.' Mr Brown says the levy will be offset by reductions in firms' National Insurance contributions.
But the steel industry says that will benefit only labour- intensive industries, not highly-automated steel. While the levy will cost steel GBP 238mil-lion a year, the NI deal will save only GBP 5million.
British steel producers will also come off worse under the Kyoto tax than rivals in other signatory countries, because of a system of rebates.
It involves firms getting a proportion of the tax back when they achieve certain emission reduction targets.
The most British Steel can hope for is 50 per cent back.
But elswhere in Europe, the rebates will be between 80 and 100 per cent.
The levy system in Britain, if it is unchanged, will probably add more than GBP 3 a ton to the cost of steel. But Dutch steel firms with 100 per cent rebates would have no extra costs, while German companies face just 4p a ton extra.
A British Steel spokesman said: 'It is very unfair. By voluntary means we have cut our greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent since 1990.
That is half the Kyoto target of 12 per cent. But these reductions will not be taken into account for the purposes of our rebates. Those start from scratch.' The Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee said: 'We have been disturbed by the unprecedented scale of the reaction to the Government's proposal.
'We share the view that, without appropriate modifications and exemptions, the levy could prove a blunt instrument which does considerable damage to sectors of the British economy already struggling to maintain their profitability.' Tory Shadow Chancellor Francis Maude commented: 'Many companies will go abroad, taking their jobs with them, while continuing to release at least as much pollution as they do now.'
Lame duck to global giant BRITISH Steel's GBP 4billion merger with Dutch metals producer Koninklijke Hoogovens was approved by European Union regulators, creating Europe's largest steel maker and the third biggest in the world.
The European Commission said competition from other EU suppliers and the strong buying power of consumers would prevent the new group acquiring an unfairly dominant position.
Overmanned and underproductive, British Steel was costing taxpayers GBP 1million a day before the Thatcher revolution of the early 1980s.
She knew a tough leader was needed to transform the lame duck into a world-beater.
That man was Ian MacGregor, who cut such a swathe through restrictive working practices and the numbers on his payroll that he was nicknamed Mac the Knife.
Later, he headed British Coal, defeated Arthur Scargill's yearlong strike and was knighted for his efforts.
Within two years of British Steel's privatisation in 1988, it was making record profits. But then it was hit by the recession of the early 90s and a worldwide glut of steel, which drove down prices. Among the major plants hit was Ravenscraig, once the symbol of Scotland's booming steel industry, which closed in 1992 with the loss of thousands of jobs.
British Steel profits began to recover in 1994 and reached a peak of GBP 1.1billion in the 95-96 financial year.
Now they are back in the doldrums, and in the last financial year there was a loss of GBP 142million because of the pound's strength.

Full text: A CLIMATE change tax at the centre of the Government's green policies looked doomed in its present form last night after a Labour- dominated Commons select committee of MPs called for changes to allay fears that it could cost Britain thousands of jobs and millions of pounds in lost orders.
The committee said yesterday it was "disturbed" by the "unprecedented scale" of the reaction from big business to the climate change levy on industrial emissions.
The Chancellor announced in the Budget in March that he planned to introduce the levy in 2001. The business and commercial sectors will be liable for the levy on their final energy consumption; energy used for domestic and transport use will be exempt.
Heavy users of energy will be eligible for reductions if they reach agreement with the Department of Environment on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
Revenue raised will be recycled to business, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points in the rate of employers' national insurance contributions. A pounds 50m fund will be set aside for improving energy efficiency.
MPs on the committee, chaired by Martin O'Neill, a senior Labour backbencher, have faced a barrage of protest and warnings from companies that gave evidence about the impact the levy will have on their businesses: Teesside Chemical Initiative estimated it would cost its firms pounds 37.3m a year, causing up to 1,000 job losses; British Sugar said it would cost pounds 6m and put the sugar beet industry into "a downward spiral"; the Food and Drink Federation said it would cost pounds 150m; the British Cement Federation estimated it would cost pounds 40m, putting the viability of coastal plants at risk; and the Energy Intensive Users Group warned it would lose pounds 571m a year, with a loss of 28,000 jobs.
"We share the view ... that, without appropriate modifications and exemptions, the levy could prove a blunt instrument which does considerable damage to sectors of the British economy already struggling to maintain their profitability. It is imperative the levy makes special provisions for energy- intensive industries to minimise any damage to their international competitiveness," the committee said.
Francis Maude, the shadow Chancellor, called the report a "damning indictment of Labour's energy tax - it is another stealthy tax on business that will cost thousands of jobs while doing nothing to help the environment".
The Liberal Democrats called for the tax to be scrapped and replaced with a full carbon tax. The select committee also criticised the failure of the Government to link the levy properly with the carbon content of fuels, and said there was "confusion" at Whitehall about it.
"A full carbon tax would clearly conflict with the DTI policy on the use of coal and gas for electricity generation. On the other hand, there is a logic deficit inherent in the proposal that electricity generated by fuels which do cause such emissions," the MPs said.

Abstract: A parliamentary committee strongly criticised the industrial energy tax yesterday, warning that it could considerably damage struggling sectors of the economy. The trade and industry committee said it was disturbed by "the unprecedented scale of the reaction" to the proposed climate change levy that is intended to reduce industry's contribution to global warming. The MPs criticised the crudity of the proposed mechanism for recycling the tax revenues, predominantly through a 0.5 per cent cut in employers' National Insurance contributions. This was essentially "a transfer of resources from manufacturing industry to the service and public sectors," they said.

Full text: A parliamentary committee strongly criticised the industrial energy tax yesterday, warning that it could considerably damage struggling sectors of the economy.
The trade and industry committee said it was disturbed by "the unprecedented scale of the reaction" to the proposed climate change levy that is intended to reduce industry's contribution to global warming.
"The government is right to make a bold commitment to meeting its Kyoto target, but that target must not be met at the expense of British manufacturing industry," it concluded.
The Kyoto protocol requires the UK to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent by 2010.
The MPs criticised the crudity of the proposed mechanism for recycling the tax revenues, predominantly through a 0.5 per cent cut in employers' National Insurance contributions. This was essentially "a transfer of resources from manufacturing industry to the service and public sectors," they said.
They voiced a suspicion that the chancellor was using the levy as an opportunity to offer most businesses and commercial sectors a "significant tax cut" by reducing employers' NI contributions in his next Budget.
The committee called for a more subtle and imaginative approach to recycling the revenues, such as introducing tax incentives for energy efficient investments. It urged the government to draw on the experiences of countries that had established energy taxes.
The report accused the government of a "logic deficit" in imposing the levy on all energy use and not just fossil fuels, which are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions.
There appeared to be "some confusion within government" because of ministers' desire to protect the coal industry and restrict the expansion of electricity generation by gas.
It urged the government to exempt renewable energy from the tax, while using it to boost the installation of combined heat and power capacity, an efficient way of generating energy.
It was also unconvinced by the government's arguments against exempting nuclear energy from the levy.
The committee criticised the confusion over the mechanism by which the Treasury would decide on reductions in the tax for energy intensive industries that reached energy efficiency agreements with the government.
It said that the Treasury's approach had done nothing to encourage a co-operative relationship between government and industry on emissions reductions.
It expressed doubts about the government's attempts to negotiate agreements on energy efficiency with 25 or more sectors.
It warned that the efficiency of such agreements was untested.
Francis Maude, shadow chancellor, welcomed the report as "a damning indictment" of the government's energy tax.
He described it as "another stealth tax on business that will cost thousands of jobs while doing nothing to help the environment". Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Full text:   THOUSANDS of West Midlands jobs could be at risk if the Government fails to scale down its plans to slap an energy tax on business, bosses have warned.
The Confederation of British Industry is to write to every MP in the region to protest about the looming climate change levy.
They said that the measures, due to be imposed from 2001 to help cut polution, would cost West Midland businesses hundreds of millions of pounds if adopted as currently proposed.
Regional chairman Digby Jones said that the tax would hit the region hardest because of its manufacturing base, a traditional heavy user of energy.
He said such a tax would be a blunt weapon to rain back consumption and accused the Treasury of a "big con" by claiming that changes to the National Insurance system would make the whole thing neutral on firms' accounts.
"It will decimate businesses in this region. Because of the nature of the West Midlands' profile, we are the ones who will take the pain," said Mr Jones.
"This region will suffer more than any other in the country from the energy tax."
He said that the CBI was not against the tax, but wanted changes to its implementation so that it was phased in to allow firms to adjust.
Mr Jones said that West Midland firms were warning that they were not just considering cutting jobs, but closing down whole factories and moving abroad.

A special land, a special time Wisconsin 2000 \ State of Mind: [All Edition]

Author: ROMELL, RICK

http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/special-land-time-wisconsin-2000-state-mind/docview/260995589/se-2?accountid=10226

Abstract: Perhaps [Ben] Logan exaggerates a bit. But check the data -- and talk to scholars, natives, transplants and expatriates -- and it becomes at least arguable that Wisconsin does indeed have its own identity, even its own culture. Sometimes that identity is readily apparent; sometimes it is more subtle. But at a time when everything from restaurant chains to cable television conspire to homogenize the country, Wisconsin does not yet completely blend in. "I was born and raised in Colorado," says retired historian Richard N. Current, who taught at UW-Madison during the 1960s. "I live in New England. But I still think Wisconsin is the most beautiful state in the country. It has the best mixture of open fields, cultivated fields, pastures, wooded hills, rocky outcroppings. . . .

Full text: Forget, for a moment, the statistical rulers that might measure Wisconsin-ness. Forget the data and the historical milestones and, if possible, the weather.
For now, just trust the sensitive antennae of Ben Logan.
Logan isn't a sociologist or historian. He's a writer. He has also, in his time, landed on the beach at Anzio, shipped out on merchant vessels as an able seaman, built bridges in Alaska.
He started out in Wisconsin but has spent most of his adult life elsewhere -- New York, Mexico, Michigan.
Twelve years ago, at 66, he came back. Specifically, he came back to his childhood home, a ridge-top farm called Seldom Seen in the wrinkled land between the Kickapoo River and the Mississippi, a place Logan memorialized nearly 25 years ago in an evocative book called "The Land Remembers."
It's a rough but intimate country Logan loves deeply, and he's attuned to its finer distinctions. He senses small differences between hilltop folks and valley folks, between the Norwegian-Lutheran village of Mount Sterling and the Irish-Catholic hamlet of Seneca just down the road.
But when Logan ventures across the Mississippi and leaves Wisconsin, his antennae positively vibrate.
"I always think when I cross into Iowa," he says, "I've left a world behind and I've entered a different world."
Perhaps Logan exaggerates a bit. But check the data -- and talk to scholars, natives, transplants and expatriates -- and it becomes at least arguable that Wisconsin does indeed have its own identity, even its own culture. Sometimes that identity is readily apparent; sometimes it is more subtle. But at a time when everything from restaurant chains to cable television conspire to homogenize the country, Wisconsin does not yet completely blend in.
People who live here, though much changed from people who lived here when the century was young, still have something of a common personality, with distinct traits and attitudes and styles that run much deeper than a taste for fish fries and Green Bay Packers games.
We're far more likely to drink than people in most other states, and we eat more, or at least weigh more.
We hunt more, boat more and pay out more of our income in taxes.
We've graduated from high school in relatively great numbers but not from college -- even though we boast the nation's top ACT scores.
We start fewer businesses -- even taking into account population differences -- but have fewer business failures. Our bankruptcy rate is about a third lower than that of the country as a whole.
We have middling salaries but high household incomes -- perhaps because Wisconsin women are more likely to work than women almost anywhere else in the United States.
Milwaukee notwithstanding, we rank low in crime and very low in poverty. And the distribution of income in Wisconsin is among the most even of any state.
Born here, we're inclined to stay, a tendency that must spring from something other than the climate: Wisconsin is among the colder, cloudier, windier states in the country.
We eat more apples, buy more Tupperware and respond less often to direct mail blitzes. We may be the only state in the country where a brat isn't necessarily a spoiled kid.
We have a legacy of ethnic diversity, albeit German-dominated, but our biggest metropolitan area remains one of the nation's most racially segregated.
We point proudly to the good-government achievements of the Progressives and the Milwaukee socialists, but we also sent Joseph McCarthy to the U.S. Senate twice. And although we elected the first openly lesbian congresswoman in the country last November, it also marked the first time Wisconsin had ever sent anyone but a white male to the House or Senate.
We're stable and comfort-loving. Hard-working, modest and responsible. Long-suffering, a bit insular, and non-glamorous.
In some ways, we're a bit like our geologic underpinnings. No mountains here. Instead, Wisconsin's chief earth-moving forces have been glaciers -- slow, relentless, grinding -- that left thousands of little lakes and a landscape that, if not imposing, is varied, pleasant and, to some eyes, beautiful.
"I was born and raised in Colorado," says retired historian Richard N. Current, who taught at UW-Madison during the 1960s. "I live in New England. But I still think Wisconsin is the most beautiful state in the country. It has the best mixture of open fields, cultivated fields, pastures, wooded hills, rocky outcroppings. . . . There's something cozy about many of these nooks and valleys in Wisconsin."
Not everyone may share Current's taste in landforms, but it's no stretch to argue that geography and climate shape culture. What if England weren't on an island? What if the South couldn't have grown cotton? What if southern California were cloudy most of the year?
"I'm absolutely convinced if I had grown up out on the Great Plains instead of on this rough hill country, I'd be subtly a different person," says Logan, speaking of his southwestern Wisconsin home. "I don't mean better or worse. I just mean different in some way. I don't know how. But I think land and place become characters in our lives. We interact with them just as surely as we interact with each other as humans."
Take water in Wisconsin. It's the state's great natural asset, and it has molded the way Wisconsinites work and play. The state's Great Lakes location fostered the growth of heavy industry, and to this day, manufacturing remains more important in Wisconsin than in almost any other state, even though it has declined.
Then there are the 15,000 or so lakes, many of them so tightly clustered that parts of the Wisconsin map look like they've been riddled with blue buckshot. Few states have such abundance. Few places anywhere on the planet, in fact, match the dense concentration of little lakes in and immediately around Vilas County.
With those resources, it's no surprise that Wisconsin registers more boats per person than all but one state, Minnesota. Or that Wisconsin has relatively strong environmental credentials -- leader of what became a national ban on DDT, home of the founder of Earth Day.
Now take our climate. Please.
"I love it when it's 20 below or 10 below, even," says folklorist James P. Leary, as he sits in jeans and manure-resistant barn boots in his UW-Madison office. "I like to be outside then. Not forever, but I like to go out. I like the crispness of the air at night, the way the stars come out, and I like the crunch of the dry sound of the snow."
That's one person's view. Many others see the Wisconsin winter pretty much as something to be endured. Either way, it leaves its mark.
"I think you see in Wisconsin people do have that capacity to endure extremes, not just in the weather but in their personal lives as well," psychotherapist Philip Chard says. "They're not as quick to come forward and say `I'm depressed.' . . . They gut it out, so by the time they do walk in the door, they're usually pretty beat up."
Climate may even figure in a state business culture that leans toward conservative financing of new ventures and conservative operating practices at companies that are up and running, says Bart Adams, a partner in Kolb Lauwasser & Co., an accounting firm.
"It's not so far removed," he says, partly joking and partly serious. "We spend a big chunk of our lives preparing for winter. . . . We see a normal climate change and cycle and maybe we subconsciously also understand that that happens in a business cycle too. It goes up and it goes down, and you have to be prepared for the down."
It took Marshall Cook a while to accept Wisconsin winters as something one simply prepares for. "I was terrified of winter the first couple of years," he says, "absolutely terrified of it."
A fifth-generation Californian who was experiencing "kind of an early midlife crisis," he moved here with his wife from the chic Napa Valley in 1979. He recalls snow heaped high along the highway as he first drove into Wisconsin on a frigid, late-winter day.
"It was like landing on the moon," he says.
But it also struck a chord.
"We crossed the Mississippi River, which I had never actually seen from the ground before," Cook says, "and started going through Dodgeville, Mineral Point, that area, and I had this overwhelming feeling that I was coming home. Which was the weirdest thing because I have no Midwestern roots and (had) never been here, anything like that. But it just felt good.
"I loved the little towns. I've since written a book about little towns in Wisconsin because I just love them so much. And I just felt this sense of rightness.
"It amazed me that there weren't fences between yards. That was one of the first things that struck me -- you could look down the block and it was just like a big park because there weren't any walls. California has just become a walled empire of people who have money trying to keep out people who don't have money, I guess, and that just floored me and seemed so good."
Other things struck Cook, too: Consciousness of ethnic heritage seemed stronger. Relationships seemed deeper and quieter.
"We also noticed right away that people don't show their money, whereas in California people wear it, they drive it, they live in it, and it's very obvious who's got money and who doesn't," says Cook, who runs writing and publishing workshops as a professor in the UW-Madison Division of Continuing Studies.
"And here it's much harder to tell. I met the guy who founded Krause Publications up in Iola, and you couldn't tell from his house that he had any more money than the carpenter next door. He was just one of the guys. And that seems to be, not universally true, obviously, but kind of a pervasive thing about Wisconsin."
Indeed, it's part of what historian and longtime state observer Jack Holzhueter, who wrote an essay on the state's character last year for the Madison weekly Isthmus, views as an "aw, shucks" strain running through Wisconsin: Keep your head down. Don't call too much attention to yourself. Work hard.
Work, in other words, like George Muth.
Muth, 44, looks a little bookish. He's short, wears wire-rim glasses and has a mustache that curls around the sides of his mouth. The occupational giveaway lies in his strong, thick-fingered hands, built over a lifetime in one of the most unrelenting, labor-intensive jobs around -- dairy farming.
Though the number of dairy farmers has shrunk dramatically over the 20th century, Holzhueter sees the state's dominant form of agriculture as contributing substantially to Wisconsinites' general attitudes toward work and hubris. A few hours spent with Muth does nothing to contradict the theory.
On a cold March day, Muth, a fifth-generation farmer who says he's "not actually a morning person," is up at 6 a.m. He starts work without breakfast.
Job No. 1: feed and water the calves. Muth's daughter does that evenings and weekends. On school days, the task falls to George.
He and his wife, Cathy, 40, live with their children -- Jenni, 11; Kevin, 17; and Peter, 18 -- at a Washington County crossroads that, on highly detailed maps, is called Cheeseville.
They have a lovely, 137-year-old fieldstone house with a tire swing hanging from a tree in the front yard, a garage and a machine shed, a couple of blue Harvestore silos, 120 acres that get planted with corn, alfalfa, wheat and soybeans, and a barn full of Holsteins that must be milked and fed twice a day, every day.
"Dairy farming is a very different life," says Cathy before heading off to her job as agriculture education director for a West Bend brokerage and advisory firm. "If you can't walk the walk, you can't talk the talk."
George does both, and at the moment, he's walking -- back and forth through the barn in quick steps -- as he prepares feed. Peter's doing the milking before heading to school. It takes 90 minutes or so, using four machines, to milk the herd of about 60 Holsteins.
With each animal, Peter straddles the manure trench and squats, squeezes out a bit of milk, applies disinfectant and attaches the suction-driven hose lines that ferry the milk from cow to stainless steel tank.
George, meanwhile, uses a hand cart to haul cracked corn from a grinder on one side of the barn to a conveyor belt on the other that will lift the grain to the big feed mixer on the second floor. Every so often he scrambles up an aluminum ladder and through a cubbyhole to check on the mixing.
And he shovels. Most of the feed components get transported by conveyor, but because of the placement of the barn's silos, more than 1,300 pounds of corn must be hand-shoveled each day.
Besides corn, the cows get protein mix and chopped alfalfa silage. For good measure -- and a little dietary fiber -- George grabs two hay bales by their twine binders, lugs them across the barn like a pair of oversized suitcases and shakes hay into the mixer.
Then he shovels maybe a couple hundred pounds of old feed from the barn floor into a wheelbarrow and shuttles it to the conveyor.
By now, it's after 9 a.m. The day is rolling. George thinks about pausing for breakfast. It's winter, so he won't have to put in the 14 or 15 hours he does during planting and harvesting.
But the vet is coming for a biweekly check of the herd. The heifers have to be fed. The barn has to be cleaned. Manure has to be hauled. The outside of the milk pipe has to be washed. There's a hydraulic leak on a tractor. A piece of hay-cutting machinery needs a new sickle. . . .
"We all take it for granted," Wisconsin Veterans Museum director Richard H. Zeitlin says of the work ethic he believes the state shares with its Midwestern neighbors, "but it is really important. Everybody wants to work. They believe in work. They cooperate in work. Wisconsin is a very productive place."
Except, perhaps, for nine days around Thanksgiving, when upwards of 650,000 people take to the woods for the annual rite known as deer hunting.
"I lived in Oregon all my life, and I always thought there were a lot of hunters there," says Tony Staley, editor of the newspaper for the Catholic Diocese of Green Bay. "But not like here. It's like a mom-and-pop store compared to Kohl's."
Pretty close. Only a handful of states outrank Wisconsin in incidence of hunting. And while participation may have fallen somewhat in recent decades, hunting, particularly deer hunting, is still a very big deal here.
Many businesses all but shut down for lack of a work force. Some schools close rather than fight the inevitable absences. And the Saturday evening Masses at churches such as St. Stanislaus Kostka in Armstrong Creek, a tiny, heavily Polish community in Forest County, are packed with worshippers in blaze orange.
"It's a beautiful sight," says Father Edward Nowakowski, pastor of the church, which draws hundreds of hunters on the opening Saturday of deer season. "That's really a wonderful sight to see. They come in their hunting gear, but they do come to church. That's inspiring."
Meanwhile, schools such as Weyerhaeuser High in Rusk County take a holiday -- "a lot of the northern schools up here do that," principal Todd Solberg says -- and work grinds to a near-halt at companies like Pewaukee builder ASI General.
"Basically we kind of write that week off as not getting much done on projects," says Fred Stier, president of ASI. All but a couple of the firm's 20 construction workers go deer hunting.
Stier accepts that -- he hunts himself -- and builds time into his firm's construction schedule to allow for it.
"It's always been that way," Stier says. The company has had clients from out of state, Stier says, who asked why nothing is on the schedule for the week of Thanksgiving.
"It's deer hunting," Stier tells them. "Nothing gets done."
Doing nothing is part of the point. Ask Larry Stremikis. That's one of the things that has drawn him back to a flat patch of Clark County woodland every deer hunting season for 40 years -- except 1961, when he was in basic training and the Air Force didn't care much about Wisconsin tradition.
"I don't sit in the woods just to shoot deer," says Stremikis, a 56-year-old airline maintenance supervisor. "I just love to sit in the woods to meditate and just watch what goes on. I can sit in the tree all day, and I've done that many, many times."
He does it on what used to be his parents' dairy farm -- Stremikis owns the land with his older brother now -- and he does it even though he hasn't lived in Wisconsin for more than 30 years.
His home now is in Indianapolis. But the location has made little difference over the years. For two decades, Stremikis flew in annually from San Francisco; for nine years, he flew in from Honolulu.
"That's just one of the disadvantages of living such a long way from Wisconsin," he says. "You lose two days of hunting in the woods just in your commute to get there. But it's always worth it."
"I guess it's just something that's in your blood."
If deer hunting runs in the blood of many of us, people from the state to our south can get under our skin a bit.
"We have this long complicated relationship with Chicago and northern Illinois where we do reap a lot of economic benefits," says Leary, the UW-Madison folklorist. "At the same time, I think there certainly is a sense among some people in Wisconsin that we're viewed by Chicagoans as hicks and peasants and these inferior beings, and many people have anecdotes to that effect.
"I remember myself mowing my lawn in Mount Horeb with my reel-type, non-motorized push mower . . . and a big fancy car with Illinois plates drove up. And this guy looks at me sort of bemusedly and says, `You know, they invented power mowers a few years ago.' And I said, `You know, they invented manners a few years ago.'
"I usually trot that out in my class, and then the students' hands go up and everyone's got some similar kind of anecdote."
Large as it is -- with half again as many people as all Wisconsin -- metropolitan Chicago funnels tourists to our resort areas, keeps Milwaukee in its shadow and in some ways claims the state as its hinterland.
"I think as a result of that, we do have a chip on our shoulders," Leary says, "And some of our sense of identity comes from defining ourselves in opposition to and sometimes in conflict with people from northern Illinois."
A case in point (three points, to be exact) is the cheesehead: It started as an insult from Chicago White Sox fans. Wisconsinites, though, gave the epithet tangible form as a hat worn with a sort of reverse pride -- to the chagrin of those who view the headgear as furthering the state's beer, brats and blaze-orange image.
"I see it both as an act of identity and an act of defiance," says Chard, the psychotherapist. He maintains that Wisconsinites have long had "a little bit of an inferiority complex about Illinois," and that proudly wearing cheeseheads provides a way to overcome the feeling.
"The trouble with people in Illinois," Chard adds, "is they don't have any symbols to work with. What are they going to do, put a flat piece of land on their head?"
No mistaking what state you're in at the Black Forest Pub in Shawano -- Packers gear on the walls, a "Don't Illinois Me" bumper sticker plastered on a refrigerator door, jugs of pickled eggs and turkey gizzards sitting on the back bar.
The place is warm and convivial. Regulars are greeted by name. People talk to strangers.
It's the Monday after the Super Bowl, and two big-screen televisions are showing the news from Denver: rioting by fans of the victorious Broncos. Patrons at the Black Forest shake their heads.
Two years earlier, after the Packers won their first Super Bowl since 1968, fans had honked horns, imbibed liberally, run around bare-chested in the frigid, biting wind. A handful got arrested. But there was nothing approaching the rioting in Denver.
Looking at the TV screen, a beefy, bearded man chewing on a cocktail straw offers an opinion that rings true: "Green Bay should have just kept winning and we wouldn't have this shit," he says.
He pauses for a moment and then, despite having just been staring at white faces on the newscast, adds, "I don't want to sound racist, but a lot of times I think it's the colored element."
For all of Wisconsin's rich ethnic diversity and heritage, the lines of race, particularly those between black and white, remain stark.
The hard evidence -- although the 2000 census may show the picture softening -- comes from demographic analysis of metropolitan Milwaukee, home to 80% of the state's black residents. Researchers have found the area to be among the most residentially segregated in the country.
Seeking to explain that, analysts have pointed to economic and demographic factors. The migration to Milwaukee of African-Americans from the South, for example, came relatively late -- just 28,000 blacks lived in all Wisconsin as recently as 1950. Because of that, researchers have said, blacks here have had less time than in other places to work themselves into the community's economic and political fabric.
"That is certainly one explanation," says Sammis B. White, a professor of urban planning at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
But White also allows for the possibility, at least, that culture plays a role in segregation.
He points to the work of economist Thomas C. Shelling on how thousands of individual decisions can have cumulative consequences that most people don't want. It explains, for example, how a freeway traffic jam can build as drivers individually decide to slow down -- each just a bit -- to gape at an accident.
Apply that reasoning to a conservative community such as Milwaukee, White says, and it's not hard to see how widespread segregation could evolve from many small, individual impulses to "just live next to one of our own kind."
Which may help explain why Milwaukee native Dennis Cross practices medicine in the Twin Cities and not here.
Cross' story is a slight variation on a classic: the second-generation immigrant who, through education, realizes the promise of his parents' enterprise and hard work.
The twist is that Cross' father came not from abroad but from Mississippi, part of that wave of African-Americans who began moving to Wisconsin, and particularly to Milwaukee, after World War II.
The city was flexing its industrial muscle then and needed labor. Cross' father and uncles found work at companies such as Allis-Chalmers, A.O. Smith and Evinrude. Cross was born in Milwaukee, went to Mississippi at age 5 to live with relatives after his parents divorced, then returned here at 13.
He got a good education, graduating from Riverside High School, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the Medical College of Wisconsin. But he also remembers slurs, suspicion and "rigid residential segregation." So when he eventually went to southern California as part of his medical training, it was a surprise to encounter a different mind-set.
"It was like someone had lifted a sheet off my eyes," says Cross, now 49. "I saw people from every walk and color of life."
Looking for an apartment in San Diego with his wife-to-be -- who is white and from Oconomowoc -- Cross was surprised when a real estate agent asked Cross what he meant when he said the couple was looking for "a black neighborhood."
And it went far beyond housing. The black-white social lines -- lines that he partly embraced -- seemed to be much less firm.
"I remember playing basketball with a bunch of black guys down by the beach, and a couple of white guys would play with these black men every day," Cross says. "And I remember elbowing the white guys, not talking to the white guys, fouling the white guys.
"And you know what happened? Some of the black guys pulled me aside and said, `Dennis, why are you so hard on Tom?' -- Tom Fink, who's now one of my best friends -- and I said, `Well you know, he's not a brother.'
"And they said -- they asked me this -- they said: `Where you from?'
"I said, `I'm from Milwaukee, you know.' And they said, `Well, we don't do that out here.' "
Cross also has good things to say about his hometown. He believes tolerance is growing here, and he says other blacks he has talked to who have moved to Milwaukee say it's a good place.
But for Cross, the weight of past experience was too heavy. He chose to settle in the Twin Cities, an area that happens to have a smaller black population, but one where he doesn't routinely wonder, as he did in Milwaukee, whether a waitress is snubbing him, or eyes are following him when he walks through a store.
"When I came (to the Twin Cities)," Cross says, "I felt like I could just focus on my specialty, enjoy my wife, without having that little extra monkey on my back."
Some other people who have lived here speak of ways beyond race in which they perceive Wisconsin as conservative or somewhat closed.
One accomplished professional, plugged in with Milwaukee leaders, said civic projects always seem to involve the same, relatively small circle of people.
A young accountant who recently moved to California says many Wisconsinites seem "more conservative, more closed-minded to others' opinions."
"A bit insular, I think," says a Wisconsin-born academic who now works in Los Angeles.
Meanwhile, some newcomers to the state, or people who move within Wisconsin, perceive a social reserve that seems to melt slowly.
"We were in Madison 10 years before we really started to make some friends," says Sue Kell, who moved there from Milwaukee and since has relocated to Las Vegas. "People have their friends from high school, and that's kind of who they stick with. My family was not originally from Wisconsin, and so they felt that way living in the suburbs of Milwaukee -- that it took them a very long time to kind of get to know people."
One possible reason: Comparatively speaking, Wisconsin doesn't see a lot of newcomers.
More than 76% of residents were born here, seventh-highest among the 50 states and a sharp contrast to such places as Florida, Arizona or Colorado, where only three or four of every 10 residents is a state native.
For all the threads that remain tightly woven in the state fabric, there is also continuing change.
The number of taverns, while still among the highest in the United States, has declined. So has drinking generally. Dairy farming is slowly shifting from 60-cow herds such as George Muth's toward larger-scale, more efficient operations that demand less labor of farmers.
The governmental reforms of the early 20th century that cemented Wisconsin's reputation as a progressive national leader -- the open primary, worker's compensation, unemployment insurance -- have given way to a different sort of leadership in Gov. Tommy G. Thompson's reworking of welfare.
Black faces are no longer unusual on the south side of Milwaukee. And Wisconsin's biggest metropolitan area, while it still bends a lot of metal, has become a significant economic player in such non-manufacturing sectors as financial services.
The impact of old-line ethnic groups such as Germans and Norwegians is so embedded in state life as to have become largely invisible, but more recent arrivals -- Hmong, Hispanics, African-Americans from the South or Chicago -- continue to season the Wisconsin mix.
Ben Logan's corner of the state, meanwhile, has gradually embraced another kind of newcomer -- young people who in the '70s began rejecting cities and standard-issue career paths for what they saw as a more natural, satisfying life in the country.
Acceptance came slowly, he says, but now the people locals used to call hippies are valued neighbors who feel a sense of harmony with the land that Logan believes runs deep in Wisconsin.
"And they brought talents," he says. "When I was remodeling this old farm house, at one point there were six people working there and I think they all had college degrees. I think two of them had master's. These were the new people, and this was how they were subsidizing their attempts to live on the land. So we're not as monoculture here as we were, and that's a good thing."
It's the sort of change in which Logan takes heart. Others may view Wisconsin as a bit static; he sees it as a rich stew that is still simmering.
"It's been a varied history in this state, and I think we're still part of that," he says. "We still have . . . that sense of newness that goes with what is still to be discovered about ourselves."
"We're not cooked yet."

Management: Environment: Industry braced for green levy Businesses must soon pay a tax on pollution and produce an audit of their environmental impact.

Abstract: The proposed industrial energy tax seems to have come as a shock to many businesses. It has provoked one of the biggest rows this government has had with industrialists, as evidenced by last week's hearing on the Climate Change Levy by the trade and industry select committee. Capital intensive businesses will suffer and have been howling. They are likely to win concessions, but there will be a tax, and other tough measures if the government is to meet its binding targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. This row over the Climate Change Levy has brought into focus the fact that environmental management means more than systems, reports and saving money in the name of waste prevention or energy reduction. Tim Pinder, the group's UK environmental manager, said the calculation of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions was a nightmare, taking six months to produce from thousands of pieces of data.

Full text: The proposed industrial energy tax seems to have come as a shock to many businesses. It has provoked one of the biggest rows this government has had with industrialists, as evidenced by last week's hearing on the Climate Change Levy by the trade and industry select committee.
The levy, announced in the Budget and due to hit the business world in 2001, will cost many companies serious money, although the sums raised will be repaid in the form of lower national insurance contributions.
Capital intensive businesses will suffer and have been howling. They are likely to win concessions, but there will be a tax, and other tough measures if the government is to meet its binding targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. This row over the Climate Change Levy has brought into focus the fact that environmental management means more than systems, reports and saving money in the name of waste prevention or energy reduction.
In many companies, environmental management has become well- established during the second part of the 1990s. It typically begins with an audit to establish the key environmental impacts of the business, the appointment of a main board director with overall responsibility, the creation of systems and reporting channels.
Then comes the annual green report. In the early days some such efforts were pretty feeble, but now even first-time reporters such as the cement group RMC manage to publish impressive documents. RMC is first to use the recently-issued government guidelines on how to measure greenhouse gas emissions.
Tim Pinder, the group's UK environmental manager, said the calculation of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions was a nightmare, taking six months to produce from thousands of pieces of data. He also pointed out that if he has done his sums right, the government may have got its figures wrong, since RMC's total emissions in the UK come to 620,284 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. That is about 0.1% of the government's estimate for the entire country, suggesting that the official figures understate the true position.
Many more companies will be joining the rush to report green figures over the next few months, pushed by the threat from the environment minister, Michael Meacher, to `name and shame" those from the top 350 public companies which say nothing about their environmental impacts. There will be many admirable analyses and highly professional examples of green management. There will more precise measurement and tighter auditing. `The push increasingly will be to have accounting-type standards,' Mr Pinder said.
But while companies are getting more serious about managing their environmental impacts, there often seems to be a huge hole at the centre of their approach which leads to shocks such as that delivered by the imminent energy tax.
In RMC's report, for example, there is no attempt to address what is the biggest single issue for most environmentalists - quarrying and landfill.
Campaigners such as Friends of the Earth have argued for years that virgin aggregates dug from quarries should be taxed in an effort to encourage greater re-use of building rubble. The quarrying industry, unsurprisingly, disagrees. The industry may well be right, but readers of RMC's environmental report would not even know that this was an important issue.
This goes to the heart of environmental management. If companies are serious they need to start with their products and production processes and ask whether they can ever be sustainable. Thus Shell now acknowledges that it is impossible to be a sustainable oil company, and tries to think of itself as an energy business.
Similarly, it will never be enough for companies to document their impacts, no matter how detailed that might be. The centrepiece of environmental management must be about reducing impacts, even when that hurts.

Full text:   Decade of disasters ahead, says study
Climate change, deforestation and overpopulation will make the next 10 years a "decade of super-disasters," says a news report.
Published by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the world's largest emergency response network, the report says: "Everyone is aware of the environmental problems of global warming and deforestation on the one hand and the social problems of increasing poverty and growing shanty towns on the other. But when these two factors collide, you have a new scale of catastrophe."
The federation says the number of people needing its assistance has increased more than 10-fold over the past six years. Last year's season of natural disasters was the worst on record.
In 1998, natural disasters created more "refugees" than wars and conflict, the federation says.
Hurricane Mitch, which dumped a year's rainfall on Central America in a few hours, left 10,000 people dead and 2.5 million temporarily dependent on aid.
"The explosive combination of human-driven climate change and rapidly changing socioeconomic conditions will set off chain reactions of devastation leading to super-disasters," the report says, adding, "the world is at risk as never before."
Climate change "will be manifested in a catalogue of disasters such as storms, droughts and flooding unparalleled in modern times," the report predicts. "The main uncertainty is where and when they will occur."
Deforestation in China's Yangtze basin contributed to the flooding that affected the lives of 180 million people and the deforestation of the foothills in the northwestern part of the Himalayas caused landslides in India last August that killed more than 300 people in a week.
The havoc caused by Hurricane Mitch also underlines the vulnerability of an "ecologically naked" landscape to extreme weather, the report says. In Honduras and Nicaragua, Mitch hit denuded hillsides, setting off huge landslides and mudflows.
The report says that even as the number of natural disasters increase, access to insurance coverage is dropping worldwide.
Insurance companies fear the destructive effect of climate change could bankrupt the industry.
In 1992, the damage inflicted by Hurricane Andrew drained one-tenth of the industry's global reserves in one night. Many insurance companies now refuse to cover the hurricane-ravaged Caribbean.

Abstract: West Midland business leaders are to spearhead a major attack on Government plans for a new energy tax which they say will devastate manufacturing companies already suffering from the economic turndown and the strong pound. The West Midland branch of the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday it would be campaigning hard for major changes to the tax proposals in order to shield heavy energy users in the region from big increases in their costs, which may threatenthousands of jobs.

Full text: West Midland business leaders are to spearhead a major attack on Government plans for a new energy tax which they say will devastate manufacturing companies already suffering from the economic turndown and the strong pound.
The West Midland branch of the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday it would be campaigning hard for major changes to the tax proposals in order to shield heavy energy users in the region from big increases in their costs, which may threatenthousands of jobs.
They say large manufacturing concerns in the Midlands will be hardest hit
"This is a big threat to jobs here. There is a real danger this will have a devastating effect on high energy users of which we have a lot," said Mr Digby Jones, the Confederation of British Industry's regional chairman.
The proposal for a user-based business-energy tax came in the Budget last spring and details of the proposal, to be introduced in 2001, have now been published.
The plan calls for a tariff of 0.21p per kilowatt hour on coal and gas and 0.6p per kwh on electricity for all industrial users, raising pounds 1.75 billion in the first year.
About pounds 50 million of the tax will be set aside for a programme to help boost energy efficiency among smaller companies and heavy energy users meeting energy efficiency guidelines will be able to negotiate by sector for a lower rate of taxsuggested at 50 per cent.
But the CBI argues that even at 50 per cent, the tax is punative and far more radical than anything so far unveiled elsewhere in Europe in response to the international Kyodo agreement on climate change.
The steel industry would be hardest hit by a net estinated bill of about pounds 233 million, the CBI says.
The Treasury says that the tax is offset by proposals to reduce employers' National Insurance contributions from 12.2 to 11.7 per cent, but the CBI says that the maths is simply not valid for manufacturing companies, which tend to be energy guzzlers.

Abstract: Michael Meacher, environment minister, yesterday rejected a fierce campaign by manufacturers against the government's proposed energy tax, insisting that it would benefit the economy as a whole. Mr Meacher said the government aimed to recycle the estimated pounds 1.7bn proceeds from the levy through a 0.5% cut in employers' national insurance contributions.

Full text: Michael Meacher, environment minister, yesterday rejected a fierce campaign by manufacturers against the government's proposed energy tax, insisting that it would benefit the economy as a whole.
He said the chancellor's plans to impose a climate change levy would cut carbon dioxide emissions by up to 2.2m tonnes a year. It is due to be introduced in April 2001.
Mr Meacher said the government aimed to recycle the estimated pounds 1.7bn proceeds from the levy through a 0.5% cut in employers' national insurance contributions.
`It is worth taking a moment to reflect on the fact that pounds 1.7bn is sufficient to reduce NICs by only a half percentage point,' Mr Meacher said. `That is some indication of the extent to which we tax employment in this country."
Some businesses, particularly those in heavy industry which consume energy intensively, have argued that the levy would benefit employee-rich firms in services or public sector bodies while imposing burdens on manufacturing.
But Mr Meacher said the levy could, according to consultants Cambridge Econometrics, create 14,000 jobs, with telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and construction among the gainers.
He said there would be discounts for energy intensive sectors, with the treasury's illustrative yield of pounds 1.75bn assuming a 50% discount for firms such as British Steel.

Abstract: Lord Sainsbury, minister for science, said that as well as mitigating the damage Britain faced from climate change - such as insurance losses and increased premiums for households and industry, it would also offer opportunities for business. Adaptation to climate change was expected to create business worth more than pounds 200bn world wide by next year and pounds 400bn in 10 years.

Full text: A pounds 10m centre where scientists can study the effects of climate change and help Britain adapt to disasters such as floods, tornadoes and heatwaves is being set up by the government.
Lord Sainsbury, minister for science, said that as well as mitigating the damage Britain faced from climate change - such as insurance losses and increased premiums for households and industry, it would also offer opportunities for business. Adaptation to climate change was expected to create business worth more than pounds 200bn world wide by next year and pounds 400bn in 10 years.
`Although climate change is a global phenomenon, many of its causes and impacts are local. By integrating research and harnessing new technolo gies we will be able to prepare for and deal with the sort of problems which could face us, such as increased risks of flooding, the erosion of coastal areas, the effects on water supply and water quality,' he said.
How to protect valuable assets from rising sea levels needed to be addressed, as well as how to manage retreat before the rising waters.
The impact on East Anglia is already being felt, with increasing droughts in summer and areas more at risk from tidal flooding and erosion. In the north-west warmer, wetter winters would also need adaptation measures.
The site for the centre, which will be supported by pounds 2m a year in extra scientific research grant, has yet to be named. Among its facilities will be a helpline for companies which need advice on how to cope with climate change.

Full text: Breathe a sigh of relief (and a lung full of pollution) if you read the National Post's editorial (Suspicious Emissions, July 8). Apparently, global warming is a "fiction." Not only that, but cheaper gasoline would lead to a higher standard of living, and higher productivity.
Tell that to the 16,000 Canadians who die prematurely each year due to air pollution, largely from the burning of gasoline and other fossil fuels, according to Environment Canada.
Or tell it to the 2,000 scientists on the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations body. They are deeply concerned that burning fossil fuels is leading to an increase in global temperatures, the impacts of which could be catastrophic.
Even the $2-trillion global insurance industry is deeply worried about our changing climate. The level of claims from severe weather events has skyrocketed in recent years.
My dictionary reads that fiction is "a story that is not fact." It seems your editorial writers have mixed up fact with fiction. Perhaps they have been spending too much time at the Esso station, confused by the gasoline fumes and the toxic benzene emissions.

THIS GOVERNMENT ISN'T SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT, IT'S JUST AFTER MORE TAX For all the talk of 'anti-car' measures and green policies, the Chancellor's main priority seems to be to get more money into the Treasury's coffers, says JOHN GUMMER: [A Edition]

Full text:   JOHN Redwood's "fair deal for motorists" was bound to stir up those who hate cars as a matter of principle. His main sin seems to be that he has dared to say the motor car isn't all bad.
Instead, he has recognised that it has given a new freedom to many people who could never have dreamt of it before.
In fact, we are a nation of hypocrites about private motoring. Ask if we want to spend more on public transport and hear the chorus of "absolutely".
What we don't admit, is that we want better buses and trains largely so that other people will travel on them. Small wonder that the best anti-road-building demonstrations need vast car-parks to accommodate all the protesters who have driven there.
So, before we get carried away by collective hypocrisy let's try to be honest. People like their motorcars and won't easily be coaxed out of them.
We can always justify our own use of the car while condemning others for selfishness. Chauffeured prime ministers are not the only ones to feel superior by insisting that others take the train to Heathrow. When we say we are sick of the traffic congestion what we mean is that we are sick of our cars being caught in it.
So we have to start any discussion by admitting the difficulty of reconciling the motor car with our environmental aims. Gesture politics are out. It is all too serious for posturing. It may sound good to increase the tax on petrol far more sharply than before but does it actually help to protect the environment? Eco-puritans don't care. They just like squeezing the motorist.
Serious environmentalists owe it to their beliefs to ask the question: "Does the additional tax on petrol and diesel permanently reduce by one mile the number of journeys undertaken?"
Is it really sensible to encourage British lorry drivers to fill up on the Continent rather than here? How does the environment benefit by making it artificially economic for companies to send lorries over from mainland Europe to compete with hauliers based in Britain?
Faced with the realities, the huge increase in fuel duty is seen for what it is - a straightforward revenue-raising ruse. Under the guise of green taxation, Gordon Brown is raking in the shekels. Tax hikes which would be utterly unacceptable for any other reason are excused on environmental grounds. We who care about the environment are being used by this Government to hide an entirely different agenda. It's a dangerous cover-up because it will destroy our environmental credibility once the public sees what is really happening.
Just look at the so-called "climate-change levy", introduced by Gordon Brown in the last Budget. That looks really green.
People like me have been calling for action; this seemed just the ticket.
That was until we read the small print. Instead of a system tailored to reduce the harmful emissions from the wasteful use of energy, it turned out to be a tax-raising operation designed to penalise industry and benefit Labour's friends in local government.
No one has ever explained how they could ever have fixed GBP 1.7 billion in tax as the means of cutting emissions by 1.5 million tons. It was merely asserted. Indeed there is no mechanism to check that there will be any reduction at all. Now poor Patricia Hewitt is busy pretending they never fixed the figure, so preposterous has it become.
Gordon Brown was converted to the levy when he realised that it was a way of gaining votes, by paying for a substantial cut in the National Insurance contribution. It is the tax take that really matters - he doesn't care two hoots about the emissions. If he did, he wouldn't have cut VAT on domestic fuel nor encouraged the burning of coal in our power stations!
WORSE still, is that the Chancellor has seen that this is a way of diverting money into local government without anyone noticing. Many industries, like horticulture and building supply manufacturers, use fuel but do not employ large numbers. They will pay a lot in the levy but get back little from the cut in NI contribution. Down at the Town Hall they employ lots of people but won't pay much towards the levy.
So they will be due a windfall payment of GBP 250 million a year because of the cut in the cost of employment. So wealth-creating industry will pay, and tax-spending bureaucracy will save.
The trouble is that John Prescott knows all this. He hasn't been fooled.
But it isn't his tax. It's the Treasury that decides, and he has had to settle for what he can get. And he must reckon that local government needs something of a break. After all, it has been the victim of the worst green trick of all.
The Government has taken all the plaudits for a green transport policy but it's the local councils that are going to get the stick.
They are going to levy the car-parking charges on the commuter. They are responsible for enforcing air quality rules and imposing new and complex traffic regulations. And it will be chaos.
High taxes in Oxford, low taxes in Derby. Cars driven out of Camden and tolerated in Westminster. Residents protected in Kensington and Chelsea, residents persecuted in Hammersmith and Fulham. The Town Halls will take the blame while the Government picks up the green credits.
So, environmentalists should not blame John Redwood for blowing the whistle.
Instead, they should be pressing him to make good his promises on "frequent, clean and reliable train and bus services", proper parking provision so we can use public transport, and better provision for cycling and walking. We must see to it that he really means what he says when he demands that motorists must have a viable alternative to using their cars.
The only way the Conservatives can gain the confidence of the environmentalists is by showing in detail that the goods will be delivered - where the present Government has so signally failed.

Abstract: The government could jeopardise the success of the Kyoto protocol on climate change if it backs down on its energy tax proposals, according to the Royal Institute of International Affairs. The UK's willingness to impose the climate change levy has "huge symbolic importance" to the global efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, says the Chatham House think-tank. The introduction of the levy will be a powerful sign that the UK is matching words with deeds, say Duncan Brack, head of the energy and environmental programme, and Michael Grubb, associate fellow, in a submission to the trade and industry select committee inquiry into the energy tax.

Full text: The government could jeopardise the success of the Kyoto protocol on climate change if it backs down on its energy tax proposals, according to the Royal Institute of International Affairs.
The UK's willingness to impose the climate change levy has "huge symbolic importance" to the global efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, says the Chatham House think-tank.
The introduction of the levy will be a powerful sign that the UK is matching words with deeds, say Duncan Brack, head of the energy and environmental programme, and Michael Grubb, associate fellow, in a submission to the trade and industry select committee inquiry into the energy tax.
"Conversely, any delay or watering down of the levy would have potentially serious and adverse consequences for the great strides already made in the development of the Kyoto agreement," they say.
The UK's actions on cutting carbon dioxide emissions are significant because of the role it played in persuading other countries, including the US, that climate change was a serious threat.
The proposed levy is a tax on the business use of energy, which will yield £1.75bn to be used in reducing national insurance contributions. But the government is under pressure to make significant concessions to high energy users, which believe the tax threatens their competitiveness.
Some of the money raised by an energy tax should be used to invest in renewable energy, according to Forum for the Future, an environmental organisation, and Cambridge Econometrics, the research group.
The study found that raising the proportion of electricity generated from renewable sources to 10 per cent by 2010 would need an extra annual subsidy of £93m. Increasing the proportion to 15 per cent would cost £370m a year.
"The main conclusion is that government can support a significant renewables programme, which secures considerable environmental benefits, essentially at no cost to the economy," says the study, which was commissioned by Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group.
The investment in offshore wind, energy crops and photovoltaics would increase total employment by 13,000 in each case, after taking into account job losses elsewhere in the energy sector.
The primary reason for supporting renewable sources is their contribution to mitigating climate change. But, in addition, "renewables offer a perhaps unparalleled industrial and commercial opportunity in the new century as more and more countries recognise their potential benefits."

Full text: FROM TWISTERS to blisters, from tornadoes to tans, Britain's weather has gone round the bend. And the Met man says there's more to come.
The nation's enthusiasm for the weather has again been fuelled by a week of dramatic climatic convulsions: a 120mph tornado in the Midlands on Monday, a blistering heatwave in Birmingham on Thursday, and a flurry of tabloid headlines on Friday.
The weather is back in fashion, though in truth it was never far from the spotlight.
For months we have witnessed a storm of stories about our odd weather and its impact. Farmers have begun importing water buffaloes, for instance, and 'super-rats' are invading city centres.
It is good racy stuff, although it masks a more striking, more serious pattern of weather change in Britain. Thanks to increasing levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, our springs are now arriving much earlier and the seas around our shores are rising and getting warmer, says the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology.
Rainfall in the South-East is drying up and potatoes, carrots and parsnips are shrivelling in the baking fields, while once exotic ailments - such as Lyme disease, spread by heat-loving ticks - are on the increase.
Events such as last year's Easter floods in the Midlands and those in the West Country in October used to occur once every 100 years. Now they come every two or three years.
It is impossible to avoid the impact of global warming - which is blamed by many researchers, although not all of them, on mankind's continued industrial burning of coal, oil and gas.
The effect of the resulting rise in carbon dioxide in the air we breathe is to make our weather more unreliable, and to make us more vulnerable to its vicissitudes.
As a result, scientists and politicians - including the Environment Minister, Michael Meacher, and the Science Minister, Lord Sainsbury - will this week launch Britain's Climate Change Centre, a pounds 10 million unit that will attempt to pinpoint global warming's impact on the nation. The centre will also outline counter-measures.
'Just consider one current trend,' said meteorologist Professor Brian Hoskins, an adviser to the Natural Environment Research Council, one of the centre's funding bodies.
'More and more people are buying large, four-by-four, air- conditioned cars,' he said. 'They keep people nice and cool in summers that are getting hotter and hotter. But they also use up much more fuel and so contribute to global warming.
'It's a vicious cycle and we have got to cut through it - not just over the cooling of cars, but for homes and offices. We will need novel ways to keep cool, methods that don't burn fuels that will make the climate even hotter.'
The British Isles face particular uncertainty over global warming because they sit at the end of the North Atlantic Storm Track. Waves of high pressure stream eastwards from America. Sometimes these storms peter out halfway across the Atlantic. Sometimes they hit the country with maximum force. As Hoskins put it: 'We are the graveyard of the North Atlantic depression system.'
This grim meteorological fate means the destabilisation of the world's climate caused by the rising temperatures will only make our weather even more unpredictable. In general, it is expected that the South-East will become hotter and drier as the North-West becomes hotter and wetter.
But more importantly, there will also be more extreme events: more twisters and more blisters, in other words. The centre will try to predict their worst ravages and come up with ways to counter them.
'It may be quite simple things,' Hoskins said, 'like building North Sea oil platforms that will have longer legs because of rising sea levels, or more complex questions such as advising insurance companies about the changing impacts of storms in the next 20 years or more. However, everything will come under scrutiny.'

Abstract: For many people, global warming sounds like a slogan wielded by climate scientists and environmentalists. However, global warming can't be dismissed as the esoteric ravings of a bunch of boffins. It seems to be inexorably altering the climate, and well established - this, despite the views of those who refuse to countenance it, arguing that weather patterns are simply cyclical, and that there's nothing to worry about. While the changes may seem infinitesimal, measurements are now throwing up statistical patterns that suggest the world is going through more than a rough patch. El Ninos and El Ninas, for example, are becoming more frequent and ocean temperature fluctuations will continue to be critical determinants in weather as the planet knows it. No one can rest easy.

Full text: A Wellington Regional Council climate change report, released this week, makes it plain that - unpalatable as the facts may be - forewarned is forearmed. Residents in vulnerable areas won't thank the council for affecting the value of their properties, but it's better they know now of the potential for danger than wait until low- lying coastal areas are made uninhabitable by higher sea levels, or by rain-generated floods.
For many people, global warming sounds like a slogan wielded by climate scientists and environmentalists. However, global warming can't be dismissed as the esoteric ravings of a bunch of boffins. It seems to be inexorably altering the climate, and well established - this, despite the views of those who refuse to countenance it, arguing that weather patterns are simply cyclical, and that there's nothing to worry about. While the changes may seem infinitesimal, measurements are now throwing up statistical patterns that suggest the world is going through more than a rough patch. El Ninos and El Ninas, for example, are becoming more frequent and ocean temperature fluctuations will continue to be critical determinants in weather as the planet knows it. No one can rest easy.
The warming of the Earth poses serious risks for maritime nations, as small island nations in the Pacific and Indian oceans can already attest. They are not expecting seas to retreat and restore the shorelines of shrinking islets, or for others to break the surface again. Scientists say New Zealand can expect higher rainfall in many parts of the country in future and, ironically, cooler temperatures as melting icecaps send cooler waters this way. Weather patterns are already bringing more rain to some places, and less to others. Those who keep climate records see more than just a trend, and with computer modelling there's already pretty good evidence that the changes require a measure of understanding, not only by climatologists and scientists.
For Wellingtonians, where ever-changing sea vistas tug at the heart strings and cause real estate agents to become expansive about the virtues of a view, there's little doubt that as warming continues, sea levels will rise and more low-lying areas will be exposed to the risk of flooding in ways they are not today.
The regional council predicts that if sea levels rise 35cm during the next 50 years, coastal erosion of the type that plagues parts of Kapiti Coast will be common at Titahi Bay, Lyall Bay, Petone, Porirua Harbour and on parts of the Wairarapa coast. Presumably the rock shelves that support Wellington harbourside transport routes to Hutt Valley, and Eastbourne and the bays of the Miramar Peninsula will also be affected.
Prudent planning - the WRC report can be judged as a good reason for it - is required to give those people who live in at-risk areas some idea of the choices they face. For example, perhaps property valuers could devise a formula that shows how property values may be affected. The owners of upmarket Manly St properties at Paraparaumu, for instance, where even moderate seas on the back of high tides have carved 20m from a seaward reserve, will certainly be interested in any propositions valuers and engineers disclose. It's not solely a question of erosion, of course, but one of insurance, the cost of protection for existing properties, and the measures needed to deal with rivers and estuaries that are as much affected by higher rainfall as they are by higher sea levels.
The WRC report is timely, and it's important that it isn't consigned to a dusty shelf.

AGAINST THE TIDE; Rising seas threaten region's coast: [3 Edition]

Full text: Wellington's low-lying coastal settlements face serious damage from rising sea levels during the next 50 years, a Wellington Regional Council climate change report says.
Roads, bridges, water mains, and storm water systems could all be at risk in the next few decades as New Zealand sea levels are predicted to rise up to 35cm by 2050, the report by council hazard analyst Michael Green said.
Mr Green said the report was prepared to help the council plan long-term for problems caused by changing rainfall and rising sea levels. The impacts of climate change would not be felt suddenly but could mean gradual changes such as increasing numbers of insurance claims for flood damage and higher flood protection costs.
He said sewerage systems were also at risk with rising sea levels. However, this is not the case in Wellington because the possibility had been taken into account with work done on Moa Pt.
Rising sea levels due to global warming are a worldwide problem. A recent Red Cross report said that Sydney would be severely flooded in 100 years because of rising tides in its harbour. And three small uninhabited islands forming part of the Pacific nation of Kiribati have disappeared under the sea. Other islands in Kiribati and nearby Tuvalu have nearly disappeared. The Indian Ocean nation of Maldives has seen a third of the beaches of its 200 inhabited islands swept away.
Mr Green told The Post a rise in sea level combined with a predicted increase in rainfall would make the impacts of storms and floods much worse.
He wouldn't name which coastal settlements might be at most risk but said coastal erosion problems already existed in areas such as the Kapiti Coast, Riversdale and Castle Point. The rise in sea level would make these problems worse, especially in areas under pressure from developers.
Victoria University geology lecturer James Shulmeister, who specialises in coastal geology and climate change, said there would be three main effects of a 35cm sea level rise in the Wellington area.
There would be coastal erosion in the soft sediment areas such as Titahi Bay, Lyall Bay, some sites around Porirua Harbour and the Petone foreshore. Secondly, a 35cm rise would mean a coastal retreat of between 15m and 20m. An increase in the sea level would mean a corresponding increase in the level of flattish rivers which could lead to flooding on the

Hutt River between Woburn and the mouth of the river.
Finally, while the increase itself would not be a problem around Wellington harbour, the combination of an increase in sea level, a spring tide and a bad storm would increase the chance of flooding in various parts of the harbour area, including Lambton Harbour, as waves would break over jetties and sea walls.
Dr Shulmeister said all of the likely problems would be manageable and it was a matter of putting plans in place to deal with them.
The Wellington Regional Council was already taking climate change predictions into account when planning flood protection work, Mr Green said.
However, it was still too soon to accurately predict the effects on the Wellington region - including rainfall levels.
Climate change had enormous economic implications for the region, he said.
"We can expect it to be wetter in some parts of the region and drier in others but specific local distributions are not known," he said.
There could be water shortages in some areas while landslides and erosion would be an increasing problem in others.
If there was a 20 percent increase in regional rainfall, another 32,000ha of land could qualify for soil conservation measures, Mr Green said. About 184,000ha are already classified as subject to moderate or severe soil slips or gully erosion.
Farmers in the Wairarapa might have to look at changing their crop and stock practices because of higher temperatures and changes in rainfall, Mr Green said.
Records showed that in the last 20 years Wairarapa had become warmer, windier and about 8 percent drier. If the trend continued, fewer frosts could mean the area became unsuitable for growing some crops such as apples which need frosts for the fruit to set.
Temperature increases could also lead to lower stocking rates on beef and sheep farms. Farmers could have to move from sheep to beef farming because beef was more suited to higher temperatures, he said.
It was not yet known what effects climate change could have on local fisheries.
* Wellington Regional councillors will attend a workshop on climate change on July 22.
--------------------
WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN WELLINGTON?
The main effects of a 35cm sea level rise in the Wellington area during the next 50 years:
* Coastal erosion in areas such as Titahi Bay, Lyall Bay, some sites around Porirua Harbour and the Petone foreshore.
* Existing erosion problems in Kapiti Coast, Riversdale and Castle Point would worsen.
* Increased flooding on the Hutt River between Woburn and the mouth of the river.
* The combination of a higher sea level, spring tides and a bad storm would increase the chance of flooding in various parts of Wellington Harbour.
* Changing rainfall patterns could see water shortages in some parts of the region and erosion in others.
* Global warming would also alter rainfall patterns in the region, forcing changes to agriculture. For example, fewer frosts in the Wairarapa could make it unsuitable for apple growing.

Abstract: "It's not meant to scare people to death but it is meant to draw attention," said John Mulvihill, national director of the Red Cross disaster relief and prevention service. One estimate by an international conglomerate of insurance firms said 700 natural disasters caused $90 billion US in economic losses worldwide, Mulvihill said. Modern toxins, nuclear reactors and other substances create new disasters waiting to happen, [Joe Scanlon] said.

Full text: OTTAWA -- The world is heading for a string of "super-disasters" because of growing poverty and environmental damage, says a Red Cross report.
World Disasters Report 1999, released Thursday by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, says natural catastrophes in 1998 wreaked the most havoc on record.
"It's not meant to scare people to death but it is meant to draw attention," said John Mulvihill, national director of the Red Cross disaster relief and prevention service.
"There's got to be some way that we can minimize . . . these ecological disasters that end up affecting, unfortunately, the most vulnerable people."
The weather turned vicious last year, often taking the highest toll on the poorest victims.
Ice storms in eastern Ontario and Quebec were followed by floods and droughts in other parts of Canada.
Around the world, massive flooding in China in April 1998 affected 180 million people, hurricanes in the fall killed thousands in Central America and an especially harsh Russian winter hit those already suffering the effects of an ill economy.
One estimate by an international conglomerate of insurance firms said 700 natural disasters caused $90 billion US in economic losses worldwide, Mulvihill said.
The federation consulted global experts on climate change, insurance claims and disaster response for the report.
Mulvihill stressed that people and governments can make a difference. Politicians can draft stronger, more preventive environment policy and individuals can prepare, he said.
"Disaster is probably only considered to be a word until it happens to you."
The Canadian ice storm hit home to thousands the importance of emergency planning, Mulvihill said.
Joe Scanlon, past president of the International Research Committee on Disaster, agrees that natural disasters are doing more damage.
"There are more people in the world, so inevitably events are more likely to hit somebody."
Modern toxins, nuclear reactors and other substances create new disasters waiting to happen, Scanlon said.
Meanwhile, people are quickly losing their catastrophe coping skills, he said.
"In simple Canadian terms, there was a time when the pioneers expected to be on their own all winter. Now you expect to drive to the corner store."
But Scanlon is wary of any claim that 1998 was the worst year on record.
Detailed information has only been available for short periods and is still often incomplete, he said.
"We don't know a lot of the things that have happened . . . We hear about the Mexico City earthquake but we don't always hear some of the stuff in the interior."
Roy Culpeper, president of the North-South Institute, said international relief efforts after disasters are only short-term solutions.
"If (countries) were able to look at long-term development (like) poverty eradication, building adequate infrastructure and housing . . . then when disaster does strike . . . at least the poorest will be less vulnerable."

Flooding in southwestern Japan last week killed at least 24 people and left 13 others missing. The Red Cross said disasters such as this are on the rise in the world. ;

Abstract: The science shows that exhaust from automobiles is a major greenhouse gas, [Lydia Dotto] says. Most scientists believe carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles cause global warming because of its increasing volumes around the world. But Dotto says governments routinely spend money on roads designed to increase car use and cut back funds for mass transit. Powerful groups such as the petroleum industry are lobbying governments to act slowly on global warming, Dotto says. "There is no question the oil industry will be more affected than other industries." But some companies such as BP Amoco are investing in solar and wind technologies, she says. "They expect to make money on these technologies in the long term." Billion-dollar weather disasters -- floods in Manitoba and Saguenay, Quebec; the ice storm in Ontario and Quebec last year -- have caused human misery and massive emergency spending by governments, she added. Insurance companies are increasing fees to make up for their outlays, a cost that is already being felt throughout Canadian society, Dotto says.

Full text:   More people need to know that there are things they can do to help prevent global warming, says science author Lydia Dotto.
Most Canadians don't even know that driving less or buying a smaller car can combat the threat of drastic climate change, she says.
"They don't understand the lifestyle or behavioural changes required," says the author of Storm Warning: Gambling with the Climate of Our Planet.
Her book details how global warming has made storms, tornadoes and floods more frequent in recent years.
The public hasn't linked events like Manitoba's Red River flood in 1997 with human-made climate change caused by emissions from cars and trucks, Dotto says. That's because the media has done a poor job explaining the links, says the Ontario author.
"The media like to cover people's houses being blasted to bits and the human side of the story. They don't deal with the science behind it."
The science shows that exhaust from automobiles is a major greenhouse gas, Dotto says. Most scientists believe carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles cause global warming because of its increasing volumes around the world. But Dotto says governments routinely spend money on roads designed to increase car use and cut back funds for mass transit.
Using transit more often would be another way for Canadians to fight global warming. "North Americans are very wedded to the car culture," says the writer. With more education about their own lifestyle choices, consumers could buy vehicles that use less gasoline or even scale down the size of the automobiles they buy.
Another choice is buying "green power," by paying an extra fee on electricity bills to generate environmentally friendlier sources of power such as wind or solar. It's an option offered by Alberta power companies.
Politicians fail to do much about the issue because they believe people don't want to make the lifestyle changes needed, says the former writer at the Edmonton Journal and Toronto Star.
Powerful groups such as the petroleum industry are lobbying governments to act slowly on global warming, Dotto says. "There is no question the oil industry will be more affected than other industries." But some companies such as BP Amoco are investing in solar and wind technologies, she says. "They expect to make money on these technologies in the long term."
It just shows how predictions of economic disaster that many believe will result from taking action on climate change must be balanced against business opportunities, she says.
Billion-dollar weather disasters -- floods in Manitoba and Saguenay, Quebec; the ice storm in Ontario and Quebec last year -- have caused human misery and massive emergency spending by governments, she added. Insurance companies are increasing fees to make up for their outlays, a cost that is already being felt throughout Canadian society, Dotto says.
These severe weather patterns had been predicted by scientists studying global warming, she says.
It's why both individuals and governments must cut back emissions of greenhouse gases, Dotto. That includes skeptics who should act if only for reasons of prudence. "You don't require proof that your house might burn down to buy insurance."
The effects of greenhouse gases spewed into the atmosphere will be around for decades, possibly even a century, Dotto predicts. That's because their life cycle can span 70 to 100 years.
"If we were to flip the switch tomorrow, we'd have another century to go before the beneficial effects would be felt."

BAHAMAS KIDS CAMP STUDIES SEA LIFE
The Bahama Islands are no longer just a hot spot for honeymooners and spring breakers. On July 1, they became the cool hangout for the 12 and younger set when Discovery Channel Camp at Atlantis Paradise Island opened. The camp, for kids age 5 to 12, melds the islands' extensive marine life with the Discovery Channel's reality-based programs.
Kids can learn about predators and their prey at "Jaws and Claws," where they can play in the technology lab on advanced multimedia equipment, make drawings of what they see and, if the weather cooperates, watch as the predators are fed. "Funky Fish Day" invites youngsters to learn the diversity of our universe through the constellations and their myths. "Dungeons of the Deep" explores a replica of the Atocha, a Spanish treasure ship that sunk off Nassau in the 1600s, and kids can find its treasures on the beach.
This program offers a camper/counselor ratio of five to one and each session can accommodate up to 100 children. Cost is $35 for day sessions (3 1/2 hours) and $40-$45 for evening sessions (four hours). Call 954-713-2500 or visit www.sunint.com/atlantis for information or call 800-ATLANTIS for reservations.
Your luggage luggers
Stuffing a week's worth of clothes, toiletries and other travel necessities into a tiny carry-on bag is one way to avoid the hassle of the luggage carousel. Another option -- a new service from TraveLite Enterprises that picks up your luggage, transfers it and finally delivers it to your final destination without your ever having to touch it. This door-to-door service is available in more than 150 U.S. cities and is expected to be international within the next six months.
Cost for this service? For a golf bag and two suitcases to go round-trip from Baltimore to Orlando using second-day delivery, it will cost about $138 and to San Francisco, $188, depending on weight. Luggage is shipped as air freight in cargo flights. Insurance is available. Call 877-BELLHOP or visit www.virtualbellhop.com
Shenandoah on horseback
Horseback rides are now available at Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. One-hour tours are given each day of the week throughout the day beginning at 8:30 a.m. The last tour leaves at 6:40 p.m. Two- and-a-half-hour tours are offered weekdays only at 8:15 a.m. All tours leave from Skyland Stables and enable visitors to view the park as early explorers did. Weekday tours: $20 for one hour and $40 for 2 1/2 hours. Weekend tours: $22. Riders must be at least 4 feet, 10 inches tall. Call 800-999-4714 for information.

It makes sense for business to go green: [Final Edition]

Author: Bronfman, Stephen

Abstract: Doctors are natural allies of environmentalists, but [David Suzuki] recently shared the podium with executives from Petro-Canada, Toyota and other corporations. In a sign of the times, these corporate leaders echoed Suzuki's words. "The potential risk to our planet is immense," said Petro-Canada senior director Greta Raymond in Calgary. "We can try to resist or delay change, or we can adapt to changing reality and ensure a long-term future for our company." Putting a price tag on climate change is important, but to effect change it must connect costs with their true cause. If the price of fossil fuels included the financial toll of climate change, acid rain, air pollution and related health impacts, the energy market would be transformed. Suddenly, environmentally benign choices, such as wind and solar power, would make economic sense. European policy- makers are already putting these proper incentives and disincentives into place. A new wind farm in the Gaspe Peninsula, among the world's largest, shows Quebec's potential as a leader in wind power. The Quebec Energy Board wants to increase Hydro-Quebec's yearly quota for wind-energy purchases, and if policy-makers listen, we could become a North American centre for wind-turbine manufacture, assembly and operation.

Full text:   Stephen Bronfman is a Montreal businessman and a director of the David Suzuki Foundation.
There is a vital shift under way in how business leaders look at environmental crises. As the damage of burning fossil fuels -- coal, oil and gas -- becomes irrefutable, major corporations are moving from denial that there are problems, to acceptance. It's intriguing that this metamorphosis of Green CEOs may relate as much to the bottom line as it does to the health of the planet.
Mounting evidence confirms that pollution hurts us all. Last month, when David Suzuki warned that about 1,900 Montrealers die prematurely each year because of air pollution, he received the support of five medical groups - speaking, in effect, for every physician in Quebec.
Doctors are natural allies of environmentalists, but Suzuki recently shared the podium with executives from Petro-Canada, Toyota and other corporations. In a sign of the times, these corporate leaders echoed Suzuki's words. "The potential risk to our planet is immense," said Petro-Canada senior director Greta Raymond in Calgary. "We can try to resist or delay change, or we can adapt to changing reality and ensure a long-term future for our company."
The risk that Raymond refers to is climate change, which, like air pollution, results largely from burning fossil fuels. Its catastrophic implications are a powerful force behind the greening of business - because when the environment ails, the economy is close behind.
The Saguenay floods and the ice storm were Quebecers' harsh initiation into the extreme weather events that climate-change models predict - and their economic fallout. The ice storm claimed at least 30 lives, while total costs reached $3 billion. This April, the driest on record, has seen valuable timberland go up in smoke, while low water levels in the St. Lawrence have meant shipping revenue losses. Climate change poses incalculable risks to our economic health.
Yet business leaders must calculate risk to ensure long-term profitability, which is why the insurance industry took an early stand on climate change. Rocked by unprecedented multi-billion- dollar claims for flood and hurricane damage, insurers are moving to reflect these rising costs with higher premiums.
Putting a price tag on climate change is important, but to effect change it must connect costs with their true cause. If the price of fossil fuels included the financial toll of climate change, acid rain, air pollution and related health impacts, the energy market would be transformed. Suddenly, environmentally benign choices, such as wind and solar power, would make economic sense. European policy- makers are already putting these proper incentives and disincentives into place.
Business leaders who realize these changes are inevitable in North America are making the strategic choice to move ahead of the regulators. These leaders will become shapers, rather than recipients of future energy policy, make money and reap the benefits of good public relations in the process. As Mike Bowlin, CEO of ARCO, said recently, "We've embarked on the beginning of the last days of the age of oil. We have a choice: to be players in the new- look energy industry of tomorrow, or be left behind.
The ARCOs of the world see the opportunities in this important and lucrative new-look energy industry: since 1990, annual growth for solar cells and wind power has been 16 and 26 per cent, respectively, compared with about one per cent for oil and coal. The future lies in photovoltaics and wind turbines, not more tar sands.
A new wind farm in the Gaspe Peninsula, among the world's largest, shows Quebec's potential as a leader in wind power. The Quebec Energy Board wants to increase Hydro-Quebec's yearly quota for wind-energy purchases, and if policy-makers listen, we could become a North American centre for wind-turbine manufacture, assembly and operation.
Another area of vast economic potential is energy efficiency. A 1994 Hydro-Quebec analysis showed that energy efficiency retrofits in the province's residential, commercial and industrial sectors could conserve enough energy to power and heat a million homes, with over-all savings to society of $3.7 billion. Moreover, such energy- efficiency investments create four times as many jobs, dollar for dollar, as investments in new energy supply.
The long-ago switch to oil and gas that brought prosperity, comfort and convenience now threatens our health, climate and perhaps our very survival. A switch to sustainable energy is inevitable because our future depends on it. Many will watch from the sidelines as clean energy markets grow and prices drop, but the sharpest business minds will throw themselves into solving climate change - at a profit.

Red Cross report is a disturbing read: [Final Edition]

Abstract: This year of disasters will follow 1998 when a record number of natural disasters caused extensive damage and drove more refugees from the land than war and conflict combined. To date the developed world has not had to face the major problems associated with these growing natural disasters. The Red Cross report said that 96 per cent of all deaths from natural disasters took place in developing countries.

Full text: Our world is getting to be a tougher place to live and we are the cause of the problems.
In a report this week the Red Cross predicts the developing world will continue to be hit by a succession of "super disasters". The reasons listed are human-driven climate change, environmental degradation and population growth.
This year of disasters will follow 1998 when a record number of natural disasters caused extensive damage and drove more refugees from the land than war and conflict combined.
To date the developed world has not had to face the major problems associated with these growing natural disasters. The Red Cross report said that 96 per cent of all deaths from natural disasters took place in developing countries.
This, of course, is a case where out of sight should not be out of mind. It is clear that if the developed world continues its reckless disregard for the natural environment, we all will be dealing with these kinds of problems in the future.
A related problem is the fact that insurance is becoming harder and harder to get for developing countries. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew drained one-tenth of the global insurance industry's reserves in one night, a figure that's difficult to imagine.
The 1999 World Disasters Report is not a document that produces comfort and we don't recommend it for bedtime reading. But we do recommend in the strongest possible terms that each of us begin to pay attention.
We are using up our world at a furious pace. We must slow down, reconsider the importance of our natural environment and get our throw-away society under some kind of control, while we still have a world left to save.

Abstract: BP Amoco launched a unique green audit yesterday that could form the basis of a controversial pollution trading scheme for the UK. The oil group has commissioned accountants KPMG and two environmental specialists to audit emissions of carbon dioxide - the most significant greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming. The audit will underpin BP Amoco's internal emissions trading system, due to go live early next year and aimed at cutting the group's emissions. And it could form the basis of the government's plans for trading of pollution permits.

Full text:   BP Amoco launched a unique green audit yesterday that could form the basis of a controversial pollution trading scheme for the UK.
The oil group has commissioned accountants KPMG and two environmental specialists to audit emissions of carbon dioxide - the most significant greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming.
The audit will underpin BP Amoco's internal emissions trading system, due to go live early next year and aimed at cutting the group's emissions. And it could form the basis of the government's plans for trading of pollution permits.
Yesterday's launch follows an outspoken attack by BP Amoco chief executive, Sir John Browne, on the government's energy tax, which from 2001 will add to companies' fuel bills but hand out the cash raised in a general reduction of national insurance contributions.
He argued for a trading system which would allow companies to buy pollution permits from other companies whose emissions were below their permitted levels - just as his company's individual businesses will be able to trade with each other, in pursuit of targets set by the group.
In a speech earlier this week seen by green activists as an about- turn in the group's environmental policy, Sir John described the proposed climate change levy as a `sin tax' which would not achieve the desired change in behaviour.
Speaking at the UK Natural Environment Research Council, he said: `I think this proposal is wrong because it is ineffective and intellectually unjustifiable.'
BP was the first oil company to break ranks with the industry two years ago and accept the need to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases. Earlier this year the group's deputy chief executive, Rodney Chase, said an energy tax could be `a powerful instrument for changing behaviour'.
Yesterday BP Amoco's director of enviromental issues, Charlotte Grezo said the group still believed in the principle of taxing emissions but thought the climate change levy was flawed.

Full text: OTTAWA - The world is heading for a string of "super-disasters" because of growing poverty and environmental damage, says a Red Cross report.
World Disasters Report 1999, released yesterday by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said natural catastrophes in 1998 wreaked the most havoc on record.
"It's not meant to scare people to death but it is meant to draw attention," said John Mulvihill, national director of the Red Cross disaster relief and prevention service.
"There's got to be some way that we can minimize . . . these ecological disasters that end up affecting, unfortunately, the most vulnerable people."
The weather turned vicious last year, often taking the highest toll on the poorest victims.
Ice storms in eastern Ontario and Quebec were followed by floods and droughts in other parts of Canada.
Around the world, massive flooding in China in April, 1998, affected 180 million people, hurricanes in the fall killed thousands in Central America and an especially harsh Russian winter hit those already suffering the effects of an ill economy.
One estimate by an international conglomerate of insurance firms said 700 natural disasters caused $90 billion (U.S.) in economic losses worldwide, Mulvihill said.
The federation consulted global experts on climate change, insurance claims and disaster response for the report.
Mulvihill stressed that people and governments could make a difference. Politicians could draft more preventive environment policy and individuals could prepare, he said.
Joe Scanlon, past president of the International Research Committee on Disaster, agreed that natural disasters were doing more damage.
"There are more people in the world, so inevitably events are more likely to hit somebody."
Modern toxins, nuclear reactors and other substances created new disasters waiting to happen, Scanlon said. Meanwhile, people were quickly losing their catastrophe-coping skills, he said.
"In simple Canadian terms, there was a time when the pioneers expected to be on their own all winter. Now you expect to drive to the corner store."
But Scanlon is wary of claims 1998 was the worst year on record.
Detailed information has only been available for short periods and is still often incomplete, he said.
"We don't know a lot of the things that have happened . . . We hear about the Mexico City earthquake but we don't always hear some of the stuff in the interior."
Roy Culpeper, president of the North-South Institute, which tracks federal aid, said international relief efforts after disasters are only short-term solutions.
"If (countries) were able to look at long-term development (like) poverty eradication, building adequate infrastructure and housing . . . then when disaster does strike . . . at least the poorest will be less vulnerable."

Abstract: Human-driven climate changes and volatile political economic conditions will lead to global "super disasters," while Canadians need to be better prepared for those that hit home, the Red Cross said yesterday in its latest report on natural disasters. Canada is not immune to large-scale disasters and Canadians are still ill-prepared for them, said John Mulvihill, national director of disaster relief and prevention for the Canadian Red Cross. "We have a mindset that `natural disaster' is only a word until it happens to you."

Full text:   Human-driven climate changes and volatile political economic conditions will lead to global "super disasters," while Canadians need to be better prepared for those that hit home, the Red Cross said yesterday in its latest report on natural disasters.
"Evidence suggests that mankind's exploitation of the environment, benign or otherwise, is significantly changing the way our biosphere works," Red Cross secretary-general George Weber writes in World Disasters Report, 1999.
The study suggests global warming is raising sea levels and might cause harsher and more frequent El Nino and La Nina phenomena, like hurricanes, droughts and floods.
"And the way we are changing the natural environment (like deforestation) renders these hazards more destructive and those people caught in their path more exposed," the document says.
The report adds that 1998 was the worst year on record for natural disasters, claiming 21,000 lives and victimizing hundreds of millions of others.
Extreme climatic events compounded by rapid economic and institutional changes make for a complex profile for future disasters, it says.
"The poor, forced to live on marginal land in urban and coastal areas where jobs are concentrated, will suffer most as the planet warms and disaster strikes - 96 per cent of all deaths from natural disasters already happen in developing countries."
The report says externally driven aid can save lives in a disaster's aftermath but responding to the threat of flood, drought and earthquake should start locally. "Disaster-preparedness has to be built through community."
Canada is not immune to large-scale disasters and Canadians are still ill-prepared for them, said John Mulvihill, national director of disaster relief and prevention for the Canadian Red Cross. "We have a mindset that `natural disaster' is only a word until it happens to you."
Mulvihill says the chief thing Canadians can do to prepare is to "know your community, know where the problems may be." He advises people to prepare emergency-survival kits.
In Canada, weather-related disasters cost an average $500 million yearly, said Grant Kelly, senior policy analyst with the Insurance Bureau of Canada.

Full text: More natural disasters expected
Friday, June 25, 1999
Reuters News Agency
Brussels -- Last year's natural disasters were the most damaging on record, the Red Cross said yesterday, and it predicts that catastrophes will become more widespread and devastating as climate change takes hold.
"Climate change is no longer a doomsday prophecy, it's a reality. . . . Changing climate means changing disaster patterns," said Astrid Heiberg, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), when unveiling the organization's 1999 World Disasters Report.
Peter Walker, director of the organization's disaster policy department, said climate change, combined with poverty, will have an effect on natural disasters over the next two decades.
"Countries that have not had a major disaster in living memory will start having them. Those that have had one or two a year will have more."
He said sea levels are expected to rise over the next generation, putting highly populated coastal areas more at risk of flooding. Even highly industrialized countries can't face the cost of protecting themselves, let alone Bangladesh, China and Egypt.
At the same time, major rivers such as the Nile, Niger and Indus are expected to get drier, leaving the interior vulnerable to drought and disease.
"We are going to see more extreme events, and this is the stuff of disasters," he said. "If we look at 1998 it gives us some sense of what we are going to get in the future."
The report said that more natural disasters occurred in 1998 than in any other year on record, and that climate change has made the consequences of the disasters more complex.
For example, when the effects of El Nino struck Indonesia, causing the worst drought in 50 years, it set off a chain reaction of crises.
"The rice crop failed, the price of imported rice quadrupled, the currency dropped by 80 per cent, food riots erupted in the capital Jakarta and in the countryside, massive forest fires burned out of control, paralyzing parts of the country with a toxic layer of smoke," the report said.
The report, unveiled in Brussels at a news conference hosted by the European Union humanitarian aid agency ECHO, said that in 1998 natural disasters created more refugees than did wars and conflicts.
Declining soil fertility, drought, deforestation and flooding drove 25 million people from their land into vulnerable squatter communities in fast-growing cities.
It said these people represented 58 per cent of the world's refugee population.
The IFRC said in its report the number of people needing assistance over the past six years because of floods and earthquakes has risen to more than 5.5 million from less than half a million.
It said that as the number of natural disasters increases and losses escalate, the amount of money going into aid activities is dropping. Over the past five years, emergency aid funds have dropped by 40 per cent and many insurance and reinsurance companies have refused to provide coverage in the Caribbean. In addition, scientists link global climate changes to altering disease patterns, including the emergence of diseases in places where they hadn't been been recorded before, the report said.

Abstract: "It's not meant to scare people to death but it is meant to draw attention," said John Mulvihill, national director of the Red Cross disaster relief and prevention service. One estimate by an international conglomerate of insurance firms said 700 natural disasters caused $90 billion US in economic losses worldwide, Mulvihill said. The Canadian ice storm hit home to thousands the importance of emergency planning, Mulvihill said.

Full text: OTTAWA - The world is heading for a string of "super-disasters" because of growing poverty and environmental damage, says a Red Cross report.
World Disasters Report 1999, released Thursday by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, says natural catastrophes in 1998 wreaked the most havoc on record.
"It's not meant to scare people to death but it is meant to draw attention," said John Mulvihill, national director of the Red Cross disaster relief and prevention service.
"There's got to be some way that we can minimize ... these ecological disasters that end up affecting, unfortunately, the most vulnerable people."
The weather turned vicious last year, often taking the highest toll on the poorest victims.
Ice storms in eastern Ontario and Quebec were followed by floods and droughts in other parts of Canada.
Around the world, massive flooding in China in April 1998 affected 180 million people, hurricanes in the fall killed thousands in Central America and an especially harsh Russian winter hit those already suffering the effects of an ill economy.
One estimate by an international conglomerate of insurance firms said 700 natural disasters caused $90 billion US in economic losses worldwide, Mulvihill said.
The federation consulted global experts on climate change, insurance claims and disaster response for the report.
Mulvihill stressed that people and governments can make a difference.
Politicians can draft stronger, more preventive environment policy and individuals can prepare, he said.
"Disaster is probably only considered to be a word until it happens to you."
The Canadian ice storm hit home to thousands the importance of emergency planning, Mulvihill said.

Meanwhile, people are quickly losing their catastrophe-coping skills, he said.
"In simple Canadian terms, there was a time when the pioneers expected to be on their own all winter. Now you expect to drive to the corner store."
But Scanlon is wary of any claim that 1998 was the worst year on record.
Roy Culpeper, president of the North-South Institute, said international relief efforts after disasters are only short-term solutions.
"If (countries) were able to look at long-term development (like) poverty eradication, building adequate infrastructure and housing . . . then when disaster does strike . . . at least the poorest will be less vulnerable."

Full text:   THE Government yesterday laun-ched a programme to measure and combat climate change, with critics demanding that more must be done to address the problem in Scotland.
Environment Minister Michael Meacher gave details of a set of 34 "indicators" which will allow scientists to measure the extent of changes in the weather.
But campaigners criticised the Scottish Office for failing to draw up a similar list after "killing off" an advisory group last year.
A report drawn up for the Government looked at possible indicators and found evidence of a range of changes in the natural world.
Indicators of climate change in the UK said swallows were arriving earlier in spring and insects were showing signs of life much sooner than was the case in the 1950s.
Previous very dry summers have led to poor health of beech trees, an increase in insurance claims for subsidence, reduced yields of root crops and later upstream migration of salmon.
The scientists - from the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, at Penicuik, Midlothian, and the East Anglia-based Climatic Research Unit - added that the changes would affect our lifestyles in many ways, including work patterns, holiday destination choices and investment decisions.
Mr Meacher said: "This set of indicators will alert us to the impact of climate change as it develops in the UK and instill a sense of urgency in responding to it."
Mr Meacher emphasised the need to cut greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, to tackle climate change, stressing that the UK will attempt to reduce emissions by 20%.
The report said the period from 1988 to 1997 was the warmest in central England since records began, with twice as many hot days (over 20C) per year as the long-term average. Sea levels in eastern Britain are increasing by 1.5cm per decade.
Globally, 1998 was the hottest year recorded and seven out of the 10 hottest years have fallen in the last decade.
In the UK, four out of five of the hottest years recorded over a 330-year period were in the last 10 years. Scotland is expected to become wetter while the south-east of England gets more dry weather.
The indicators did include some specifically Scottish matters, such as the skiing industry, which was thought to be under threat.
However, it related more to English issues, such as the risk of tidal flooding in London and the appearance of ice on Lake Windermere.
The report acknowledged that researchers encountered problems "identifying single indicators for the UK as a whole".
Friends of the Earth Scotland welcomed the launch of the document but added that a separate Scottish initiative should have been developed.
Head of research Dr Richard Dixon said a Scottish Environ-ment Protection Agency-led group had been set up in 1996 to look at the problem but was wound up last year.
It suggested Scottish data should be prepared on CO2 emissions, rainfall, temperature, river flow and sea level changes.
Dr Dixon said: "The Scottish Office was obviously scared of the results from an indicators project that they did not control so they killed it off.
"The Scottish Parliament needs Scottish indicators to help them take the most appropriate action here. We will be calling for such a project as a matter of urgency."

Abstract: INCREASING poverty and deteriorating environment will combine in the near future to produce an era of "super-disasters", the International Red Cross warns today. Last year was the grimmest on record for "natural" catastrophes: Hurricane [Hurricane] Mitch killed 10,000 people in Central America, Indonesia was parched by the worst drought in 50 years and floods affected 180 million people in China. The weather system El Nio, for example, triggered not only drought in Indonesia but a chain reaction in which the rice crop failed, the price of imported rice quadrupled, the currency value fell by 80 per cent, deforestation and declining soil fertility drove people to the cities and there were food riots in Jakarta.

Full text:   INCREASING poverty and deteriorating environment will combine in the near future to produce an era of "super-disasters", the International Red Cross warns today.
Last year was the grimmest on record for "natural" catastrophes: Hurricane Mitch killed 10,000 people in Central America, Indonesia was parched by the worst drought in 50 years and floods affected 180 million people in China.
But worse is to come, the federation's World Disasters Report predicts.
"Everyone is aware of the environmental problems of global warming and deforestation on the one hand and the social problems of increasing poverty and growing shanty towns on the other," said Red Cross president Dr Astrid Heiberg. "But when these two factors collide, you have new scale of catastrophe."
The weather system El Nio, for example, triggered not only drought in Indonesia but a chain reaction in which the rice crop failed, the price of imported rice quadrupled, the currency value fell by 80 per cent, deforestation and declining soil fertility drove people to the cities and there were food riots in Jakarta.
Forest burn-offs ran wild and blanketed Indonesia with smoke as they burned for months. Worldwide, 21,000 people died because of El Nio.
The number of people needing Red Cross help because of floods and earthquakes has grown in six years from less than 500,000 to more than 5.5 million, with a disaster relief bill for 1998 of GBP 60 billion.
Ninety-six per cent of natural disaster deaths are in developing countries with natural phenomena creating more refugees than conflict, the report says.
But as the number of disasters has increased over the past five years, emergency aid to poor countries has been slashed by 40 per cent, the report says.
Insurance coverage is also shrinking as the industry tries to protect itself against the costs of climate change.
After suffering a number of "billion-dollar" storms, many insurance companies now refuse to insure the hurricane-prone Caribbean. In the case of Hurricane Mitch, which devastated much of Honduras and Nicaragua, only two per cent of the total GBP 4.6 billion in losses was covered, it said.
"That substantial gap will continue to increase as the insurance industry continues to retreat from the front line of disaster coverage to escape escalating losses," the report says.

Abstract: Warmer springs mean swallows are now arriving on average six days earlier than in the 1970s, and oak trees are coming into leaf 19 days earlier than in the 1950s, according to a report. And warmer winters mean that noticeably less gas is being used in households in the late months of the year, while the proportion of deaths from all causes occurring in January has dropped.

Full text: GLOBAL WARMING has already begun to affect Britain in many small ways, from swallows arriving early to reduced gas use in winter, the Government announced yesterday.
Warmer springs mean swallows are now arriving on average six days earlier than in the 1970s, and oak trees are coming into leaf 19 days earlier than in the 1950s, according to a report. And warmer winters mean that noticeably less gas is being used in households in the late months of the year, while the proportion of deaths from all causes occurring in January has dropped.
These and other changes are in a database of climate change indicators for Britain, created jointly by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology and the University of East Anglia, which the Government unveiled yesterday. It was previewed by The Independent earlier this year. The 34 indicators are designed to pick up the impact of global warming on society and the economy as well as on the natural world. They include factors as diverse as the number of insurance claims for subsidence and storm damage, the number of holidays taken in the UK and the amount of skiing in Scotland, as well as the number of vineyards in the UK and the dates at which wild birds are laying their eggs. They also include direct climate data, such as the record of air temperature in central England, which dates back to 1659, the longest such series of data in the world.
Four of the five warmest years in the whole record have occurred in the last decade - 1989, 1990, 1995 and 1997. Mike Hulme, of the University of East Anglia, disclosed that the last two winters (97-98 and 98-99), taken together, were the least cold for 350 years, with only one "cold day" - defined as when the average temperature in central England drops below zero and stays there - between them. The indicators are provisional but those monitored so far provided "firm evidence" that the climate was not only changing, but already affecting our environment and our society, the Environment minister, Michael Meacher, said yesterday.

Abstract: When El Nino hit Indonesia, causing the worst drought in 50 years, it set off a chain reaction of crises which the report calls "super-disasters." The home rice crop failed, the price of imported rice quadrupled, the currency dropped by 80 per cent and forest fires burned out of control, blanketing parts of the country in heavy smoke.

Full text: A record number of natural disasters last year caused extensive damage and drove more refugees from the land than war and conflict combined, the Red Cross said Wednesday.
Its 1999 World Disasters Report predicts the developing world will continue to be hit by "super-disasters" because of human- driven climate change, environmental degradation and population growth.
The report, an annual survey of humanitarian trends, says events including Hurricane Mitch and the El Nino phenomenon, plus declining soil fertility and deforestation, drove 25 million "environmental refugees" from their land and into shanty towns around the fast- growing cities of the third world.
That is 58 per cent of the global refugee population.
When El Nino hit Indonesia, causing the worst drought in 50 years, it set off a chain reaction of crises which the report calls "super-disasters." The home rice crop failed, the price of imported rice quadrupled, the currency dropped by 80 per cent and forest fires burned out of control, blanketing parts of the country in heavy smoke.
Fires, droughts and floods from El Nino claimed 21,000 lives, while the deforestation of China's Yangtze basin contributed to flooding which affected the lives of 180 million people. The natural disaster bill for last year was more than $1.375 trillion.
The report, carried out for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, says 96 per cent of all deaths from natural disasters took place in developing countries.
As the numbers of such human-driven disasters increase it is becoming harder to obtain insurance in certain areas, particularly in the poorest countries.
Hurricane Andrew in 1992 drained one-tenth of the global insurance industry's reserves in one night, says the report.

Abstract: Trends such as the earlier arrival of spring, rising sea levels and drier summers are providing "firm evidence" that climate change is affecting the UK, the government said yesterday. It published a report by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology and the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia that set out a number of indicators of climate change. Michael Meacher, environment minister, said the indicators would: "Help to track our changing climate, alert us to the impact of climate change as it develops in the UK and instil a sense of urgency in responding to it."

Full text:   Trends such as the earlier arrival of spring, rising sea levels and drier summers are providing "firm evidence" that climate change is affecting the UK, the government said yesterday.
It published a report by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology and the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia that set out a number of indicators of climate change.
Michael Meacher, environment minister, said the indicators would: "Help to track our changing climate, alert us to the impact of climate change as it develops in the UK and instil a sense of urgency in responding to it."
"This report provides the evidence that not only is the climate changing, but it is also affecting our environment and our society," he said.
The researchers said oak trees were coming into leaf earlier, insects were emerging earlier, swallows were arriving earlier and robins and chaffinches were laying their eggs earlier.
The period of 1988 to 1997 was the warmest in central England since records began, with twice as many hot days (with temperatures over 20{deg}C) per year since records began. Previous dry summers have led to an increase in insurance claims for subsidence, reduced yields of root crops and later upstream migration of salmon.
The number of times the Thames Flood Barrier has closed over the past 14 years has increased. The average sea level off the east coast is increasing by 1.5cm a decade.
The study also linked mild winters with lower human mortality.
Although the changes that have been observed so far have been modest, the government expects to see greater impacts as the climate continues to change, some of which will be damaging and costly to deal with.
The indicators, which will be reviewed in two years, will be updated annually on an internet site. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: Firm evidence that Britain's climate is changing emerged yesterday with a report showing that spring arrives earlier and the sea is getting warmer. There are already 21 changes apparent, according to the report's monitoring team at the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, and at the climatic research unit of the University of East Anglia. Spring is arriving earlier, sea levels are rising and sea water is half a degree warmer. The tick-borne Lyme disease, a paralysing illness suffered by humans and domestic animals, is rising because of the warmer summers.

Full text: Firm evidence that Britain's climate is changing emerged yesterday with a report showing that spring arrives earlier and the sea is getting warmer.
The report, designed to keep track of how global warming is affecting Britain, also shows that the summers are hotter and drier.
Launching the report in London, Michael Meacher, the environment minister, said: `However successful the world is in reducing carbon dioxide levels, even if we cut the increases to zero now, we will still be forced to cope with some climate change because of the extra gases we have put into the atmosphere.'
There are already 21 changes apparent, according to the report's monitoring team at the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, and at the climatic research unit of the University of East Anglia. Spring is arriving earlier, sea levels are rising and sea water is half a degree warmer. The tick-borne Lyme disease, a paralysing illness suffered by humans and domestic animals, is rising because of the warmer summers.
The drier summers mean oak trees are coming into leaf in Surrey 21 days earlier than they did in the 1950s. Through the 1990s, swallows have been arriving in Britain five days earlier compared with the 1970s.
The report, Indicators of Climate Change in the UK, which also looks at how plans can be made to adapt to the differences, examined obvious changes like temperature and rainfall patterns to weather- related insurance claims and to increases in insect pests that thrive in warmer weather.
Yesterday, Mr Meacher pointed to the floods in the Midlands last year, those in Wales and the west country in October, and the rise in the river Derwent this March, as further evidence.
`They were all once in a 100 year events, and they all happened in the past two years,' he said. `This is consistent with climate change.'
The period 1988 to 1997 was the warmest in central England since records began, with twice as many hot days a year - defined as being over 20C - as the long-term average. Cold days, where the temperature fails to average more than zero for a 24-hour period, have gone down. There was only one `cold' day in the past two winters, a record for the past 340 years.
Scotland, meanwhile, is experiencing wetter winters, and south- east England drier summers.
The report said that hot, dry summers are linked to high ozone levels in rural areas - potentially harmful to people and vegetation - a rise in the number of insurance claims for building subsidence, and increased domestic tourism.

Full text: LONDON -- A record number of natural disasters last year caused extensive damage and drove more refugees from the land than war and conflict combined, the Red Cross said Wednesday.
Its 1999 World Disasters Report predicts that the developing world will continue to be hit by a succession of "super-disasters" because of human-driven climate change, environmental degradation and population growth.
The report, an annual survey of humanitarian trends, says events including Hurricane Mitch and the El Nino weather phenomenon, plus declining soil fertility and deforestation, drove 25 million "environmental refugees" from their land and into shanty towns around the fast-growing cities of the Third World.
That represents 58 per cent of the global refugee population.
When El Nino hit Indonesia, causing the worst drought in 50 years, it set off a chain reaction of crises which the report calls "super-disasters."
The home rice crop failed, the price of imported rice quadrupled, the currency dropped by 80 per cent and forest fires burned out of control, blanketing parts of the country in heavy smoke.
Fires, droughts and floods from El Nino claimed 21,000 lives, while the deforestation of the Yangtze basin in China contributed to flooding which affected the lives of 180 million people. The natural disaster bill for last year was more than $110 billion Cdn
The report, carried out for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, says 96 per cent of deaths from natural disasters took place in developing countries.
As the numbers of such disasters increase, for human-driven reasons, it is becoming harder to obtain insurance cover for certain areas, particularly in the poorest countries.
Hurricane Andrew, in 1992, drained 10 per cent of the global insurance industry's reserves in one night, the report says.
The world's largest reinsurance company, Munich Re, says insurance losses in the last decade have cost the world economy nine times more than in the 1960s.
After a series of billion-dollar storms, many companies refuse to cover the Caribbean. Flood losses, the most serious, are impossible to insure against in some countries.
"Who will insure the uninsurable?" asked Peter Walker, director of disaster policy for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The answer, it believes, is investing money in flood control and disaster preparedness.
The World Bank is considering ranking countries according to their disaster preparedness, and some insurance companies are already offering reduced premiums to countries that take steps to decrease potential losses.
